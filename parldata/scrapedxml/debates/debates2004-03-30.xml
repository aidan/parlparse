	<p pid=".1403.5/1">There is no specific sanction provided for under the 4th Geneva convention or otherwise but we have repeatedly made our concerns known at national and EU level to the Government of Israel about their policy of so-called targeted killings, which we consider to be unlawful.</p>

	<p pid=".1403.6/1">Before the killing of Sheikh Yassin and three people in his immediate vicinity, B'Tselem, the Israeli information centre for human rights&mdash;the Foreign Office accepts its figures as accurate&mdash;recorded that since September 2000, 135 Palestinians have been extra-judicially executed by Israel, and that in the course of those assassinations another 90 Palestinians were killed, including 28 children. The Government have repeatedly made it clear that that policy is illegal. Do they accept that the policy is not only criminal, but self-defeating? How many more murdered people will it take for them to attempt to fulfil their obligations under articles 146 and 147 of the convention? Surely it is incumbent on them to use other sanctions against the Israeli Government to get them to pursue a policy that is lawful, moral and much more likely to reverse the spiral of hatred and violence.</p>

	<p pid=".1403.7/1">Our position on those so-called assassinations&mdash;straightforward killings&mdash;is the same as the hon. Gentleman's, and it is shared by others on both sides of the House. The killings are unlawful, unjustified and self-defeating, and they damage the case that Israel makes in the world. The fact that the killings led to the deaths of not only those whom Israel holds responsible for terrorism, but entirely innocent bystanders, including children, simply emphasises the unlawful nature of that approach, and its counter-productive effect. We will continue to make our position clear to the Government of Israel in representations, which we continually make both bilaterally and through the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.7/2">So far as peace is concerned, the best way to secure a peaceful settlement to that long-standing and terrible conflict is by encouraging and cajoling all parties to return to the pathway set out in the road map. It is the only pathway to peace, and, despite the difficulties, we will continue to do our best to ensure that the parties pursue it.</p>

	<p pid=".1404.0/1">Unlawful killings are only one aspect of Israel's breach of the 4th Geneva convention: torture is commonplace; residents are sealed off; land is confiscated; and houses are demolished&mdash;I saw all that in the Gaza strip. Do the Government have the political will to consider sanctions at some point&mdash;all other measures have failed&mdash;to try to get Israel to uphold the 4th Geneva convention?</p>

	<p pid=".1404.1/1">We pursue the enforcement of the 4th Geneva convention in a variety of ways, including regular conferences to review progress. I understand my hon. Friend's frustration and anger, but if we weigh the matter in the balance, we must appreciate how the environment in Israel has changed since the end of September 2000 with the instigation of the so-called armed intifada, which has led to the deaths of about 1,000 Israelis in the most terrifying series of terrorist attacks. In addition to the hundreds of Israeli deaths and injuries, the political process has been paralysed. We want Israel to observe its international and domestic obligations, but we also want a tougher and more effective approach from the Palestinian Authority to clamp down on terrorism emanating from within the occupied territories. We also want a more effective and less ambiguous approach from some of Israel's neighbours, which have encouraged terrorism in the past and still do so today.</p>

	<p pid=".1404.2/1">We all agree with what the Foreign Secretary has just said, but because there is such widespread disquiet in the House, particularly among those who would count themselves as friends of Israel, after this Question Time, will he inform the Israeli ambassador that last week's actions are deeply deplored by hon.

	<p pid=".1404.3/1">I would be delighted to do so. The strength of my representations will be all the greater because it is perfectly plain that that view is reflected in every quarter of the House. The hon. Gentleman will know that I issued a strong statement of condemnation on the morning that the news of Sheikh Yassin's killing came through, and that afternoon my noble Friend Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean called the Israeli ambassador into the Foreign Office to receive our formal complaint.</p>

	<p pid=".1404.4/1">Will the Foreign Secretary accept that the views expressed up to now this morning do not reflect the views of all hon. Members? Does he understand that Israel's action in killing Sheikh Yassin was a legitimate response to an extraordinary situation? <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1405.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/875" speakername="Louise Ellman" colnum="1405"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-01.htm#40330-01_spnew8">
	<p pid=".1405.1/1">Sheikh Yassin was the leader of the terrorist organisation, Hamas, which is dedicated to the destruction of the state of Israel, and which greets every attempt to make peace and reconciliation possible with more killings of civilians, whether they be young people in pizzerias and discos or old people at religious ceremonies sitting round the Passover Seder table. Does my right hon. Friend understand that Hamas is the enemy of peace; and can he give us any news as to whether he will follow the lead of the European Union in banning Hamas and its activities in the United Kingdom?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1405.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1258" speakername="Jack Straw" colnum="1405"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-01.htm#40330-01_spnew9">
	<p pid=".1405.2/1">Of course I understand the strength of feeling on the part of my hon. Friend and several other hon. Members, but it is fair to say that there is widespread concern about the killing of Sheikh Yassin. I do not believe that any Member of this House who expresses their concern about such killings has, however, any doubts about the nature of Sheikh Yassin. I was the Home Secretary who first banned the military wing of Hamas and took the lead internationally in doing so&mdash;certainly in Europe. On Tuesday last week, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the freezing of the assets of several leaders of Hamas. We will continue to take all appropriate action against Hamas and its terrorist activities.</p>
	<p pid=".1405.2/2">However, I say to my hon. Friend, as I say to my friends in the Israeli Government, that in my judgment, which is widely shared, their actions in adopting this policy of so-called targeted killings&mdash;among other things, they are not targeted&mdash;is not only unlawful, but counter-productive, because it greatly taxes the support of Israel's friends, as well as its opponents.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1405.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/797" speakername="James Clappison" colnum="1405"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-01.htm#40330-01_spnew10">
	<p pid=".1405.3/1">While the loss of innocent Palestinian and Israeli life is equally regrettable, is it not absolutely right that at all material times Hamas must take a large share of responsibility for the loss of lives on both sides owing to its consistent opposition to peace, its use of terrorism to undermine peace, and support for peace, in Israel, and its continuing use of terrorist tactics? Is it not now essential that there should be a change in the Hamas leadership or a move away from support for Hamas on the part of Palestinians so that the emphasis can shift back towards negotiation, and a turning away from the violence to which Hamas is so clearly committed?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1405.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1258" speakername="Jack Straw" colnum="1405"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-01.htm#40330-01_spnew11">
	<p pid=".1405.4/1">I entirely agree with the first part of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. Those who wish peace want to see Hamas not only dealt with appropriately, but marginalised politically. One of the sadnesses of what has happened in the past week is that its result has been far from such political marginalisation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1405.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1200" speakername="Ernie Ross" colnum="1405"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-01.htm#40330-01_spnew12">
	<p pid=".1405.5/1">The overwhelming majority of Members will support everything that my right hon. Friend has said this morning. As he will know, many countries have had terrorists who went on to become Prime Ministers. We need to reinvigorate the Americans in order that they can get the peace process back on the rails&mdash;that is the answer to Hamas and to targeted killings. What is my right hon. Friend doing actively to encourage that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1406.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1258" speakername="Jack Straw" colnum="1406"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-01.htm#40330-01_spnew13">
	<p pid=".1406.0/1">We are doing everything that we can, including providing appropriate security advice to the Palestinian Authority and a great deal of other support. It should be remembered that after the United States, the United Kingdom is the largest bilateral donor to the Palestinian Authority across the international community. That is sometimes forgotten by those who wish to criticise the position of the British Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1406.0/2">The organisation that has been the greatest block on progress in respect of the road map has been Hamas, because it was behind the bombing on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-19">19 August</phrase>, which effectively blew up the progress that had been made on the road map, and it has continued its terrorist outrages.</p>
	<p pid=".1406.0/3">In our own way, we have faced terrorism, albeit on a much, much lower scale than that which is faced by Israel, and we know about some of the moral and political dilemmas that arise from it. We found that the best approach was to be tough but lawful, and to act in a way that ensured that the terrorist organisations were marginalised. That is the view not least of very many people living in Palestine, in the occupied territories, who have nothing but contempt and hatred for Hamas and who wish to see a peaceful outcome to the current terrible conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".1406.4/1">I welcome the Government's support for the debate on UN reform, especially given the genuine threat of terrorism. Will my hon. Friend ensure that the debate also takes account of the way in which the UN and the wider international community deals with issues such as climate change, world poverty and the sort of continuing dispute, for example, between Israel and the Palestinians, which was the subject of the previous questions?

	<p pid=".1407.0/1">First, I assure my hon. Friend that that is not the intention of the reform debate. We have to demonstrate that the UN has both the physical and political capacity to face up to key strategic challenges such as international terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However, at the same time, we must tackle global insecurity and inequality. Our arguments are not about justifying the actions of the most powerful; they are emphatically about ensuring that the UN has the capacity to face up to the issues that I outlined. Indeed, the Secretary-General has been arguing for that.</p>

	<p pid=".1407.3/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that the debate on the UN is profoundly important for this century if we are to have good government and the rule of law throughout the world? In trying to achieve that, we need to give more attention to the needs of failing states, especially the small number that fall under the control of brutal dictators who are so well entrenched that the world has a right to demand their removal. In those circumstances, we should all be in favour of regime change if we have any concern for the stability of the world and the welfare of the populations in those states.</p>

In this day and age, the argument that as long as nation states maintain their abuse of human rights within state boundaries they should be beyond the reach of the international community is unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid=".1408.0/1">No individual should be persecuted for their faith. I understand that discussions have taken place in the Sri Lankan Government about some form of anti-conversion legislation. However, no decision has been made on the form that it is likely to take. Parliament in Sri Lanka was dissolved in February and the matter fell for the time being. Our high commissioner has raised the issue with Ministers in Sri Lanka and they said that any law would be carefully discussed with representatives of all major religions in the country to ensure that no religion was discriminated against. They also said that any measure would be targeted against what they call unethical conversions, which means those obtained by financial or other inducements. However, we look to the new Sri Lankan Government to continue to uphold the freedom to have or to adopt a religion of one's choice, which is currently enshrined in the Sri Lankan constitution.</p>

The negotiations that have been conducted to bring forward the peace process have in many ways, at least until recently, been a model and a bright light in what otherwise has been a difficult international landscape. As my hon. Friend refers to the considerable work being done by the UN, may I add that enormously important work has been done by the Norwegians in getting this process going and succeeding? They have done a tremendous job. We will have to await the outcome of elections, but either way the peace process is likely to continue, certainly with the support of the UN and this Government.</p>

I visited the great monastery of Gracanica, and I know that our soldiers, as well as those from other NATO forces, have been deployed to guard churches.

Does he accept that the concerns expressed by Javier Solana at the EU summit about the political situation in Kosovo&mdash;I understand that the Russians will raise the issue at the NATO Council in three or four days' time&mdash;underline the need for us to be more proactive in seeking a political settlement in Kosovo?</p>

	<p pid=".1409.3/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. It is a common view across Europe that for the last three or four years we have been chained to the wheels of events rather than guiding Kosovo and Serbia to a new political relationship and future. That relationship must be formed on the basis of common European values, maintain standards relating to the rule of law and democracy, and above all, show respect for minorities, other religions and the culture and communities of people who have lived there for many hundreds of years. The issue of Kosovo and the future of Kosovo and Serbia now require serious political thought and consideration.</p>

To be honest, I am delighted that British troops have been found to go there because I think they will add value in helping to stabilise the local situation, but ultimately a political solution must be found.

	<p pid=".1410.0/1">I join my hon. Friend in praising the actions and standards of British troops in Kosovo. I went there recently with the Defence Select Committee. Does my hon. Friend agree, however, that the rule of law has not yet been established, as Kosovo is effectively still being run by Albanian-led criminal gangs? As Bosnia demonstrated, the rule of law must be established before both democracy and investment can be promoted. Will my hon. Friend stress to our allies who still have national caveats preventing the closest and most effective working relationships between the civilian police and the military that priority must be given to removing those caveats?</p>

	<p pid=".1410.1/1">My hon. Friend makes fair points, although I think that President Rugova and Prime Minister Rexhepi are decent and honourable men, and I would not want to refer to links between them and criminal gangs. It is all too easy to fling insults around. It must also be said that the closest possible support for the rule of law is needed throughout the region, including full-hearted co-operation with the international criminal tribunal in The Hague. If everyone in the Balkans made sure that those accused of serious war crimes, for example, were taken to The Hague, that would send a positive signal.</p>
	<p pid=".1410.1/2">My hon. Friend is right to say that we need state authority in Kosovo. We need authority over property and investments, over the rule of law and over the bringing of people to justice. Some 189 people have been detained in connection with the recent inter-ethnic violence, and I hope that if a charge is approved they will speedily be brought before courts.</p>

	<p pid=".1410.2/1">Does the Minister recall that throughout the 1990s Europe was grossly disfigured by ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and does he recall the initial collective failure to deal with that properly? Examples such as Srebrenica, where 7,000 men and boys were slaughtered, are a shaming memorial to that failure. Those events make the need to restore stability in Kosovo all the more urgent.</p>

	<p pid=".1410.3/1">The status of Kosovo is on the agenda, but I think it important for us to maintain our position, which is that we want the application of what I described as European standards in Kosovo. Violence must not be rewarded in any way: we must attach ourselves to that important principle. I also think that we need a new dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade. Some initial remarks in Belgrade were not helpful, although since then a commitment by the Belgrade city government and the Pristina authorities to rebuild mosques and churches has gone in the right direction.</p>

It is a professional organisation and the outburst of violence happened fast and spread like bushfire. We have sent troops to help stabilise the situation. Once again, we could put even more troops in Kosovo, but what is really required is a political solution that must involve Belgrade and other partners in the region. I say again that it is not my intention to go through all the different options from the Dispatch Box, but the Government are now addressing themselves seriously, in collaboration with our partners, to tackling the problems.</p>

The hon.

That land is among the most fertile in the west bank and is home to 275,000 people, so the wall is already of great and adverse consequence to the people who are trapped between it, the barrier and the green line.

Sadly, I do not take that view, and it is unrealistic to believe that any outside interlocutor&mdash;be it the British Foreign Secretary, the American Secretary of State or heads of state and government&mdash;can achieve that because the divide is so great and the hatred and fears on both sides so profound.</p>
	<p pid=".1412.2/2">The United States Government remain engaged and committed, notwithstanding the fact that an election is coming up. We are working with the Palestinians above all and especially on their own security, because unless and until the Palestinian Authority can demonstrate that they can take control of security in their own territory in Gaza and the west bank, they will be unable to convince Israel or the international community that they can be an effective interlocutor. That is what we are doing, and we are making considerable progress. We continue to provide substantial aid to the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, and we are working through the European Union and the Quartet, and with the Government of Israel.</p>

Is it not true that the only country that can make any impression on Israel and put any pressure on it is the United States?

	<p pid=".1413.1/1">As I have said, the United States has the greatest external influence, but it is only an external influence; decisions are for the sovereign Government of Israel, who jealously guard their own power and autonomy. We need to acknowledge the significant progress that the Bush Administration have made in the past three years in respect of Israel and Palestine. It was President Bush who pushed for the adoption of what became resolution 1393, which for the first time recognised a two-state solution: a secure state of Israel, side by side with a viable state of Palestine. That has been supplemented by resolutions confirming the road map, in which the United States played a leading part, along with the European Union and ourselves. The United States is engaged, but external actors can be as engaged as they like: that will have no effect unless and until the parties directly involved in the conflict are willing to negotiate.</p>

It says that 24 per cent. of Opposition Members of Parliament in Zimbabwe have been the subject of assassination attempts&mdash;a truly astonishing figure&mdash;and 16 per cent. have been tortured and three murdered.

There was no referendum on the Single European Act. There was a proposal for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty&mdash;but what did the right hon. and learned Gentleman do? He spoke against the proposal for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty and he marched into the Lobby against the referendum on the Maastricht treaty even though the Maastricht treaty vastly extended powers to a degree that this draft will not do. We will take no lectures on the issue of a referendum&mdash;</p>

Given that those two countries were on the brink of nuclear war, some said, only two years ago, given that the process of dialogue is now so firmly entrenched and given the unique relationship that we enjoy with both those countries, what more does the Foreign Secretary think that we can do to build on that uniquely optimistic scenario?</p>

The fact that the tests have gone as well as they have, without any violence, has greatly strengthened each side's confidence in the other, after years of enmity. The best that we can do is to support both sides in the process. Of course there are international dimensions to the process, which were terrifying two years ago, but it is essentially a bilateral conflict, so our role is one of support, not interference.</p>

The plain fact is that, for the tourism industry in Cyprus, the Government of Cyprus and the many British citizens who have relations with Cyprus, it was important to give accurate and fair travel advice. Of course it turned out to be true: Cyprus was not affected by the conflict. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the dossier should not have referred to Saddam's capabilities, he will join a very motley and unfortunate crew indeed.</p>

	<p pid=".1420.2/2">I accept the point about European norms, but there are exceptions in many countries to EU acquis and rules.

The House has an enormous role to play once a decision leaves B&uuml;rgenstock.

	<p pid=".1422.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to create a new offence of corporate killing that applies to all companies and unincorporated bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/3">Over the years, the issue of corporate killing&mdash;or corporate manslaughter&mdash;has been raised many times in the House. The last attempt to introduce legislation on it was made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/853" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> in April 2000, and I am pleased to see him in his place. The issue raises strong feelings and it is worth reflecting a little on why so many people, particularly Labour Members, see it as so important.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/4">In the late 1980s in the United Kingdom, there was a series of disasters, each of which shocked the nation. Even today the roll-call is painful to recite. In March 1987, the Herald of Free Enterprise ran aground off Zeebrugge, with 192 dead; in 1987, the King's Cross underground fire left 31 dead; in July 1988, the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster left 167 dead; in 1988, the Clapham rail crash left 37 dead; in 1989 the Kegworth airline crash left 47 dead; in 1989; the Hillsborough football stadium disaster left 97 dead; and in 1989, the Marchioness river boat sinking left 51 dead.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/5">Those disasters involved different companies and occurred across a diverse range of industries, but the public inquiry that followed each one had a common thread: the disaster could have been prevented had the company involved taken steps to ensure that its organisation operated safe systems of work within a strong safety culture.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/6">The disaster with which I am most familiar is Piper Alpha. I will not rehearse all the background to it; suffice it to say that Lord Cullen, who carried out the public inquiry, made fierce criticisms of Occidental, the oil company operating the Piper Alpha oil platform. He said that there were</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/7" class="indent">&quot;significant flaws in the quality of&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/8">Occidental Petroleum's</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/9" class="indent">&quot;management of safety which affected the circumstances of the events of the disaster . . . Occidental management should have been more aware of the need for a high standard in incident provision and firefighting.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/10">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Senior management were too easily satisfied that the permit to work system was being operated correctly, relying on the absence of any feedback of problems as indicating that all was well . . . they adopted a superficial attitude to the assessment of the risk of major hazard.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/12">I shall come back to Piper Alpha later.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/13">The accumulation of disasters&mdash;and inquiry conclusions that suggested, at best, that there was a widespread problem of a poor safety culture&mdash;led to demands for improvement. There was also increasing concern about the inability of the law to punish those responsible for the perceived negligence that led to many unnecessary deaths. There is a common law offence of corporate manslaughter or culpable homicide in Scotland. In England, the offence may be committed by companies or individuals. An individual commits manslaughter if it can be proved beyond reasonable doubt that he or she caused a death through gross or wilful negligence. There is no separate test that allows the court to consider whether the company acted with gross negligence. For example, it is not possible for the courts to consider a company's various failures and determine whether, on aggregate, it could be said that they constituted gross negligence. Corporate guilt is entirely dependent on individual guilt.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/14">In practice, the offence is extremely difficult to prove. The Piper Alpha case was considered under Scots law, under which the tests are similar. The Lord Advocate refused to instruct a prosecution. He decided that there was insufficient evidence on which to base a successful prosecution, despite all the harsh words of, and the evidence placed before, Lord Cullen. Indeed, after most of the disasters in the 1980s on which an inquiry was held, there was no&mdash;or inadequate&mdash;investigation of criminal offences.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/15">In 1996, the Law Commission for England and Wales produced a report on involuntary manslaughter that recommended two offences of unintentional killing which were based on different fault elements: reckless killing and killing by gross carelessness. The commission prepared a draft Bill. The Labour party manifesto in 1997 gave a commitment to introduce legislation, and that was reinforced after the election by the then Home Secretary. Since then, there has been a consultation process and several statements confirming that commitment, including a further manifesto commitment in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/16">During consideration on Report of the Criminal Justice Bill in 2003, the Home Secretary said that the Government would announce a timetable for legislation and that they intended to publish a draft Bill. That timetable has not yet been provided, and there is no sign of the draft Bill. Indeed, the rumblings from inside Whitehall are not positive. It is suggested that there are still serious difficulties with the Bill and there is speculation that the main problems centre on the issue of Crown immunity. Of course, I have no way of knowing whether that is true or simply gossip, but if there is a problem, the Government need to resolve it quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/17">My Bill would provide that a corporation would be guilty of corporate killing if a management failure by that corporation was the cause, or one of the causes, of a person's death, and if that failure constituted conduct that fell far below what could reasonably be expected of the corporation in the circumstances. The Bill would also apply to a Crown body. It should apply to the Crown and it would considerably strengthen the health and safety culture in this country.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/18">Lord Cullen's inquiry into the Piper Alpha disaster made it clear that there were substantial and significant failings in the way in which the Department of Energy too, which was then responsible for enforcing safety offshore, carried out its responsibilities. A short time before the disaster, a worker was killed on the Piper Alpha platform. Department of Energy inspectors investigated and made recommendations, but none of them was carried out, which meant that the last hope of preventing the Piper Alpha tragedy was lost.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/19">I have always been concerned that there was no prosecution of Occidental, the oil company that operated the Piper Alpha platform. If my Bill had been in force at that time, there would have been a prosecution. There is no question in my mind but that if Occidental had been prosecuted, it would have been appropriate to prosecute the Department of Energy. We cannot have a system that punishes operators for poor safety if we do not apply the same standards to those who are required to regulate the safety system. If the Government are still wrestling with how Crown immunity might apply in the case of corporate killing, I urge Home Office Ministers to contact their colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/20">In June 2000, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions published &quot;Revitalising Health and Safety&quot;, which was described as a strategy statement, and which included a number of action points. Action point 15 states:</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/21" class="indent">&quot;the Government will seek a legislative opportunity, when parliamentary time allows, to remove crown immunity from statutory health and safety enforcement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/22">As the House knows, responsibility for health and safety now lies with the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/23">My Bill would extend to Scotland, which I think is important. Although responsibility for legislation lies with the Home Office, the Bill is a health and safety measure that will apply in the main to companies and businesses throughout the UK. Both health and safety law and corporate law apply across the UK, and uniformity is vital, especially within larger corporations.</p>
	<p pid=".1422.1/24">The main purpose of my Bill is not to create queues of recalcitrant company directors, or even civil servants, being brought before the courts to be punished for their poor safety records. Its purpose is to act as a disincentive to poor safety systems and to encourage companies and others to recognise that poor safety is far more expensive, in every way, than good and strong safety cultures and practices. My earnest wish is that the Government introduce their legislation as soon as possible, but in the meantime, I recommend the Corporate Killing Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid=".1425.5/2">Today's debate is about the effective collapse of immigration controls in this country. Let us start by recognising the origins of that catastrophic failure. In May 1997, the Labour Government tore up all our policies on immigration and asylum. In particular, they got rid of the so-called white list, restraints on benefits and the agreement with the French Government. The result was an increase of 200,000 incomers per annum in the UK in the first five years of the Labour Government. It is therefore no wonder that the immigration and nationality directorate was collapsing under the strain.</p>

	<p pid=".1426.8/1">Speaking as a Whip non-plant, perhaps I could strengthen the evidence that my right hon. Friend is giving the House by telling him that over the past two to three years the Breckland district council, which covers part of my constituency, has calculated that between 15,000 and 20,000 migrant workers have arrived in its district area. It has no means of knowing whether they are here legally or illegally. It has been extremely difficult to raise concerns among Ministers about whether these people are protected, catered for, dealt with or in any way rendered less vulnerable than invisible people will be.</p>

	<p pid=".1427.0/1">My right hon. Friend makes an excellent point. She flags up something that I had not intended to raise, but I think it important: that is, that the issue has serious implications. The proper management of immigration in its totality has an important role in improving or maintaining good community relations, reducing or controlling the burdens on societies and protecting the people themselves. As the cockle pickers' incident demonstrated only too clearly&mdash;it took the Government six weeks to convene a ministerial meeting&mdash;everyone is affected, including people coming into the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/2">I shall go through the events of the past few weeks. Three weeks ago, the civil servant, Steve Moxon, revealed that immigration officials in Sheffield had been ordered by senior managers to drop key checks on migrants coming to Britain under the European Community Association Agreement. First, the Home Office denied it categorically again and again. Eventually, the Minister was forced to admit that the allegations were correct. However, she did not tell us the full facts.</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/3">The Immigration Minister told the House that the decision to waive checks was &quot;rare and untypical&quot;. Now we have learned that it applied to bogus students, sham marriages, people with dubious immigration histories&mdash;in fact, it applied to anyone whose application was more than three months old. In effect, this meant granting visas on the back of spurious and demonstrably false claims. As one civil servant in the immigration and nationality directorate wrote in a letter this weekend,</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/4" class="indent">&quot;This is almost like the CPS&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/5">the Crown Prosecution Service&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/6" class="indent">&quot;being told to destroy the papers in all prosecution cases, except where there is a 100 per cent. prospect of a conviction, so that the backlog can be cleared.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/7">That is the view from the front line&mdash;not from the ministerial suite, but from the front line of the immigration and nationality directorate. If virtually all applications were being granted, how on earth can we believe the Minister's claim that the practice of rubber-stamping was rare and untypical?</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/8">The Immigration Minister also told the House that the decision to sanction such a policy was taken at a junior level in Sheffield. She told us that she had had nothing to do with it. This week we learned that the Minister had sanctioned a much broader policy. The memo that ordered civil servants to grant all applications over three months old stated:</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/9" class="indent">&quot;This exercise has been agreed by the Minister of State, Beverley Hughes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1427.0/10">So how can the Immigration Minister deny all knowledge of this practice, when she ordered it in the first place?</p>

	<p pid=".1427.1/1">When the right hon. Gentleman received the e-mail from Bucharest on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>, did he consider it his duty to submit the evidence to the Sutton investigation? Why did he wait three weeks to bring it to the notice of the House?</p>

	<p pid=".1428.0/1">I could almost see the Whips' sheet in front of the hon. Gentleman when he was reading out the question. I have two points to make. I remind the hon. Gentleman and this arrogant Government that Ministers are accountable to Parliament, not the other way round. If the hon. Gentleman had listened to his own Home Secretary on the radio this morning, he would have heard him say that that was the responsible thing to do if one did not know the provenance of a piece of information. That is what I did until I could confirm the provenance of the document, which was last Wednesday night/Thursday. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman should talk to his own Home Secretary. He was the one who said that that was the right thing to do. The Whips' plants should get their act together.</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/2">I shall excite the Whips' plants now. In the past few days, documents that have been sent to me, which I am making public today, indicate that the decision to waive checks on ECAA applicants went wider and deeper than any previous memo suggests. These documents suggest that ministerial denials of responsibility are, frankly, incredible. I have given the Home Secretary a copy of the documents and placed a copy in the House of Commons Library. The story they tell is one of concerns ignored, warnings unheeded and objections overruled.</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/3">Last night the Minister of State claimed that she knew nothing of the allegations of the consul in Bucharest. That is difficult to believe when one looks at the facts. I have a letter written by Sir John Ramsden, a senior Foreign Office civil servant, to Chris Mace, who is the deputy director general of the immigration and nationality directorate. It was copied to Peter Wrench, the deputy director general in charge of policy. It is one of several accounts of the abuses of the ECAA scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/4">Let me read the House the key extracts. Sir John is writing about the ECAA scheme. He states:</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/5" class="indent">&quot;It clear from what they&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/6">the British Embassy in Bucharest&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/7" class="indent">&quot;told me that this has developed into an organised scam that completely undermines our entry control procedures&mdash;and indeed makes a bit of a nonsense of having a visa regime.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/8">He continues:</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Post had just received 70 virtually identical business plans . . . Interviewed applicants rarely knew what was in their business plans, typically explaining that these had been 'written by the solicitors.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/10">The letter goes on:</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/11" class="indent">&quot;It was often clear that applicants had no idea about the trade they were supposed to be setting up in the UK. . . Post have to write long referral letters pointing out the flaws in the cases submitted to them . . .&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/12">But the business case unit in the Home Office</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/13" class="indent">&quot;only rarely refuses applications. . . . Even those with a previous immigration history e.g. people caught submitting forged documents in the past have been accepted under the scheme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/14">He concludes:</p>
	<p pid=".1428.0/15" class="indent">&quot;It is demoralising for our Post to have to devote a great deal of work to servicing a scam which makes them look ridiculous.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1429.2/2">Last night the Minister asked why the consul in Bucharest had not taken the matter up with his senior managers. Let me read to the House a letter that James Cameron wrote to the Home Office as far back as October 2002 to complain about the way in which ECAA applications were processed. He states that the Home Office</p>
	<p pid=".1429.2/3" class="indent">&quot;judgement and decision making with regard to BCU/ECAA applications is a continual problem for overseas posts such as Sofia and Bucharest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1429.2/4">He continues:</p>
	<p pid=".1429.2/5" class="indent">&quot;Many of the applicants have adverse immigration histories, administrative removals, suspect relationships, have applied after Leave To Remain has expired, and been working illegally in the UK for sometime prior to their ECAA application.&quot;</p>

One example is a Ms A. who was a former British asylum seeker. All her claims for asylum and all her appeals were turned down in the mid-1990s. Facing deportation, Ms A. absconded. She was subsequently picked up by the police and removed from the UK in 1997&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, picked up and removed. Exactly right&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid=".1429.4/2">Ms A. was not, one would have thought, an ideal candidate for the ECAA scheme, yet in October 2002 she was granted an entry visa to the UK under the scheme, under a Labour Government. Or consider Mr. N., whose application to the ECAA scheme was reviewed in March last year. The British embassy &quot;strongly&quot; recommended that Mr. N.'s application be refused because he had insufficient funds to support himself without recourse to public funds. The Home Office's response? &quot;Entry cleared.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1429.4/3">Many other examples of extraordinary ECAA applications include not least a range of builders who know nothing about bricks and mortar, and electricians who know nothing about electricity. A common factor in these applications was an inability to speak English. And the Home Office response? &quot;Entry cleared.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1430.3/6">The letter also states:</p>
	<p pid=".1430.3/7" class="indent">&quot;It is no wonder that our daily work is now confined mainly to the depressing task of processing ECAA main applications, ECAA dependants, family visits to ECAA members, or hapless visitors or businessmen with forged documents and increasingly credulous applications to visit the UK with the sole purpose of working there . . . Many local agencies and legal firms in the UK are now jumping on the ECAA bandwagon and submitting mass applications here for applicants with horrendous previous local or UK immigration records, as it is widely and correctly perceived that it is easier to get into the UK under the Agreement that it is to go on a visit.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1431.4/2">We are discussing a massive well organised migration scam that civil servants had drawn to the attention of the Home Office, but Ministers did nothing about it. That is the central allegation that the Home Secretary must answer.</p>
	<p pid=".1431.4/3">When my office spoke to Mr. Cameron last Thursday, he said that the concerns he raised could easily have been brought to my attention by any one of his demoralised staff. As the man in charge, however, he felt he should be the one to raise them. Frankly, he is a very brave man: at the end of the day, the buck stops with him, and the Minister should learn something from that.</p>
	<p pid=".1431.4/4">This is not a question of one or two operational failures; what we have witnessed over the past month is an extraordinary outbreak of incidents that are symptomatic of a catastrophic failure of the system. It is a story of committed and loyal civil servants struggling to make a failing system work, and having their cries for help ignored.</p>

	<p pid=".1431.6/3">I am glad to see that the Home Secretary recognised the magnitude of the problem this morning. That is why, as I understand it, he has announced a major investigation, with staff being sent to Bucharest and Sofia&mdash;the problem is here, not there&mdash;and the setting up of a hotline for civil servants who want to reveal problems without being set about by the Government public relations machine. I welcome those measures, which belatedly begin to recognise the size of the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1431.6/4">The Home Secretary must make a decision, however. Either he believes that what I have described is the result of systemic operational failure, in which case the Minister is to blame, or it is a failure of policy, in which case he is to blame. Whichever it is, somebody should shoulder responsibility for this disaster.</p>

	<p pid=".1432.0/3">The allegations are serious and concern sensitive issues with profound implications for attitudes to immigration and for the actions of the Government, both now and in the future. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is no good Conservative Members shouting, &quot;Hear, hear&quot;, because they will not get any jokes or knockabout&mdash;these matters should be treated with the gravity that they deserve.

	<p pid=".1432.2/1">I will happily do that for my hon. Friend and the House, and I intend to work through the allegations one by one. Today, I have announced the suspension of all applications from Romania and Bulgaria, and the fast track has already been suspended, as those who are familiar with the issue will know. I am instigating an immediate further inquiry, and, as the shadow Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>, has said, I have indicated that staff should immediately go to Bucharest and Sofia to examine the further allegations.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/2">Had the claims been made available to the Sutton inquiry, we would have taken them into account from <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>. Unfortunately, the claims were not available, but as I indicated on the radio this morning, we are setting up a hotline and a website so that those who do not want to use the existing whistleblower procedures can feel free to speak without intimidation. That may disappoint <i>The Sunday Times</i> and other newspapers, because staff will have to report things through the system, not outside it. I promise them, however, that any allegations will be dealt with properly and sensitively.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/3">We will pick up on the work of the National Criminal Intelligence Service. That was mentioned in Mr. Cameron's e-mail, which indicated that it was doing an excellent job&mdash;as it was, on the back of the conference that was held with the Foreign Office in November 2002 on dealing with the problems and opportunities of developments in south-east Europe. That was part of our recognition of the fact that organised criminality would undermine the case for accession to the European Union, undermine proper immigration procedures, and undermine our attack on drug smuggling. That led to allegations of the kind that have been reiterated today.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/4">I mention the conference in November 2002 because the fresh material&mdash;not fresh in the sense that the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden has had it for a long time, but in the sense that he has put it into the public arena&mdash;relates very much to what was happening in autumn 2002. Yes, Chris Mace and Peter Wrench did work for the Department then, but they have not done so for some considerable time. [Hon. Members: &quot;So what?&quot;] Conservative Members should not assume that we disagree with them just because they have a political hare running. Some of us agree that action should have been taken. Some of us&mdash;including the Minister of State and me&mdash;believe that if material is placed before senior management they should act on it. We are talking about allegations of fraud and forged documents. People who use false papers and have an immigration history that rules them out should be ruled out. It does not require a great deal of intelligence to recognise that, just common sense. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear another sedentary intervention saying that my right hon. Friend the Minister is to blame. How on earth can one blame her for actions taken in relation to the failure to follow through on allegations of the magnitude that I have described and have been alleged by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden?</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/5">The e-mail that was revealed last night was sent by Mr. Cameron on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>. That coincides exactly with the day on which my right hon. Friend the Minister set up the review to examine these issues. I do not dispute for a moment that the shadow Home Secretary did not know who had sent the e-mail, and I do not doubt his word in terms of its not being revealed until last Thursday, but I do think that it was irresponsible, having had that document and others, not to have placed them before the Sutton review.</p>

	<p pid=".1434.7/1">But I do not remember a single Minister resigning. I remember that BSE cost the country billions of pounds, that it cost people a great deal of misery, and that there were very many allegations, but I do not remember the Secretary of State or any Minister resigning. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members are shouting that they were exonerated. Well, my right hon. Friend the Minister has been exonerated. [Hon. Members: &quot;No, she has not.&quot;] Yes, she has. This is not simply a matter of protecting my integrity or that of my right hon. Friend or other Ministers: it is about the confidence that the public need to have and about the morale of staff in dealing with such issues as they undertake a difficult job. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden said, &quot;We value the staff, we have confidence them, and we applaud them for their courage.&quot; So do we. We have, above all, a duty of care to our staff, and we have not sought to blame them for what has happened. [Hon. Members: &quot;Yes, you have.&quot;] No, we have not. We have sought to get to the root of the allegations that were made in relation to specific measures that were taken, why they were taken, and who authorised them to be taken, even if we understand why they were taken. There is a difference.</p>

	<p pid=".1435.5/1">I want to make some progress before I give way again.</p>
	<p pid=".1435.5/2">We need to get a bit of light on the issue, as well as heat, so I am happy to deal with the facts. I remind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/920" name="Chris Grayling">the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> that I was not in the Chamber for my right hon. Friend's statement because I was in the United States; otherwise, I would have made the statement myself. I have read it, however, and the truth is that she simply gave the facts. There is a big difference between trying to get to the facts and blaming staff, as was illustrated by the example of BSE that was cited a moment ago. Somebody had made the decisions, so somebody was to blame, but in the end nobody was blamed. Well, fair do's: if nobody is to blame for anything, nobody is accountable for anything. We are accountable and responsible for our policies. I am responsible and accountable even when I have not devised the policies because that is our constitution, which goes back a very long way. As someone who did politics at university, I am fully familiar with its niceties.</p>
	<p pid=".1435.5/3">Let me deal with the context of the events. For example, let us consider the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden that we inherited a golden era of immigration and asylum control. In fact, we inherited a complete shambles in 1997. The previous Government did not have an electronic fingerprinting system; they had a computer that had broken down, and it took 20 months to process the initial decision on asylum compared with two months now. There were 54,000 outstanding cases whereas there is now less than half that number. Fewer than 9,000 people were removed every year, whereas last year we removed 17,000 asylum seekers as well as 12,000 other illegal immigrants. If the Opposition want to bandy words about who inherited a shambles and who did something about that, we are happy to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1435.5/4">My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Citizenship and Immigration has been instrumental in turning the system around in the past 18 months. She has ensured that, instead of a 45 per cent. increase in asylum claims, there has been a 50 per cent. drop in the past year. <i>[Interruption]</i>. I mention asylum only because there has been a clever attempt to combine the word &quot;asylum&quot; with the immigration allegations that have been made in the past three weeks, to the point where even a BBC political reporter did that on the news yesterday. That is not surprising because some of the newspapers that have jumped on the bandwagon have hinted&mdash;they have not told lies because not telling the truth is good enough for them&mdash;that the matter related to the asylum system rather than entry clearance, and to those who were already in the country and having their cases reaffirmed. [Hon. Members: &quot;Blame civil servants and the media.&quot;] I was not blaming anybody but simply pointing out that there is a desire to confuse the system. It exists because some people deeply oppose any inward immigration to this country.</p>

	<p pid=".1436.1/1">I shall in a moment. When we published our White Paper two years ago, we set out a clear, balanced policy and a comprehensive approach to immigration, nationality and asylum.

We wanted people who did not have a legitimate asylum claim to apply openly and legitimately to come into the country to work.</p>

	<p pid=".1436.3/1">I shall give way in a moment. People inside and outside the House have opposed that balanced policy throughout. I want to make it clear that we are sticking to it. Whatever the allegations, whatever the truth of the matter, we shall not be diverted into believing that everybody who applies to enter our country&mdash;those who want to work or happen to have a foreign name, a different nationality or religion&mdash;is somehow suspect and up to no good, and should be rejected.</p>

	<p pid=".1436.4/1">The Home Secretary spoke of the importance of good community relations. All hon. Members agree with that.

	<p pid=".1436.5/1">Doubling the removals of those who are not here legitimately has helped. Identity cards would be a major step forward in ensuring that we knew who was in the country, whether they were entitled to services and whether they had been authorised to draw on those services. It would also make the reinstitution of embarkation procedures, which the previous Government abandoned, at least a possibility. At the moment, it is not.</p>

	<p pid=".1437.0/1">There are two central issues. The first is the specific charges of fraud, which need to be fully investigated; the second is that we have deliberately misused the European Community Association Agreements system, which the previous Government introduced.

	<p pid=".1438.2/1">I shall in a moment but first I want to deal with the four allegations. Two were straightforward and would not normally have been viewed as a cause celebre and, as I said earlier, two raised profound issues that need to be tackled. The first of the latter was the Moxon allegations. Whatever that individual's background and whatever statements he may have made, he deserved to be taken seriously. The review was set up to examine what he had alleged. The allegations related to the accession countries and what would happen before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1438.2/2">It was alleged that fast-tracking had been authorised to get people through the system and thus reduce the number of people who were seen to come in and register after <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State's head was supposedly on the block and her resignation was called for because of that. First, the allegations were proved to be entirely untrue: she had not authorised any change in practice in relation to fast track. Secondly, 80 per cent. of the cases were of people already in the country whose stays were being reauthorised. Even if one is not terribly intelligent, it is not difficult to understand that one cannot fast-track people into the country who are already here. Therefore, one cannot be accused and found guilty of fiddling the figures&mdash;that was the allegation&mdash;so that those people would not be counted from <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>. Despite all the hysteria, that allegation did not stand up to scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid=".1438.4/1">I am trying desperately to keep the debate on a level that addresses facts and issues. People will have to draw their own conclusion both about behaviour in the Chamber and how people have been dealing with these matters outside. The facts in relation to the case that was put by Mr. Moxon, whose subsequent revelations will lead people to make judgments about his motives, need to be set aside.</p>
	<p pid=".1438.4/2">After the Moxon suggestions, we had the e-mail from Mr. James Cameron, which was sent, as I understand it, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>. As I spelled out, that was the day on which the review began. Incidentally, that was just four days after Mr. Cameron had been in the same room as one of my senior officials in Bucharest, along with others, talking about the very issues that we are debating this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid=".1438.4/3">On 1 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-02">2 March</phrase>, Mr. Cameron was quite properly in a meeting with a senior official from my Department. That official was seeking to get to the truth about the allegations and behaviour involved. When he came back, he wrote a note indicating that he would take action on the appropriate lines to ensure that the allegations were properly investigated. As he had indicated that, I was surprised to learn that, four or five days later, these allegations were made as if no one had been listening or taken any action at all&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> No, I am not smearing anyone. Perhaps it would be better if I did not give the facts so people could just have their prejudices. I am merely spelling out that tightening checks and investigating concerns are not the prerogative of the Opposition. It happens that my staff were, rightly, concerned about that and prepared to act on it. Therefore, the Cameron allegations must be taken seriously, unlike the second allegation, which was about the backlog reduction accelerated clearance exercise.</p>

	<p pid=".1439.0/1">If there were concerns about the Cameron allegations before they were expressed in the e-mail, why were they not investigated by the Sutton inquiry?

Why do civil servants in his Department feel that they cannot use internal channels to raise their concerns?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1439.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/739" speakername="David Blunkett" colnum="1439"  time="013:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-10.htm#40330-10_spnew16">
	<p pid=".1439.1/1">First, Mr. Cameron is not a member of my staff, but that does not change the issue. We should not bandy words about which civil servants leaked what to whom, because we had a bellyful of receiving e-mails and faxes when we were in opposition, some of which were accidental, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1219" name="Gillian Shephard">the right hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mrs. Shephard)</phrase> will recall, including finding her diary and handing it back to her. I put that on the record because it is important to show that politicians have some integrity. We remember what we received and did not receive from nefarious sources when we were in opposition, and that will continue.</p>
	<p pid=".1439.1/2">I will come back to James Cameron in a moment. The second allegation was about the clearance exercise, which was not only in line with practice developed from the late 1980s, as was described a moment ago, but entirely sensible and in accord with the practice that we would have expected to be laid down, not necessarily authorised by current Ministers but certainly authorised in the past by Ministers. The second call for my right hon. Friend to resign was therefore absolutely spurious, and had no basis in fact.</p>
	<p pid=".1439.1/3">The third allegation was even more ridiculous and concerned applications for citizenship. With security checks still in place, character checks and references still taken up, full immigration history still undertaken, and after a risk assessment and 100 per cent. tally with passport checks on visits overseas, it was decided not to recall people's passports that had already been in the possession of staff dealing with those cases. Again, a call was made for my right hon. Friend's resignation on a completely spurious issue designed to muddy the waters on the premise that if one flings enough mud, repeats things often enough, and feeds something into the equation on a daily, weekly or <i>Sunday Times</i> basis, eventually something will stick.</p>
	<p pid=".1439.1/4">I want to make something clear. <i>The Sunday Times</i>, the Tory party and anyone else can keep on throwing mud, but my right hon. Friend is not resigning, she is not being sacked and she has the total support of this side of the House and everyone who has dealt with her.</p>

	<p pid=".1440.0/1">My right hon. Friend is right to pinpoint <i>The Sunday Times</i>, which is full of dishonesties and inaccuracies on stories of this nature. This one was particularly untrue. Is he aware that its editor is a man called John Witherow, of whom the vast majority of the public will not have heard because of his hiding behind a wall of privacy? He is fond of misleading the public and charging them money for the privilege of being misled, but has never thought about resigning himself. I can tell my right hon. Friend that in 100 years, not one editor has resigned for giving inaccurate information or lying to the public&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".1440.3/1">My right hon. Friend was describing the process that has been under way over the last few weeks.

	<p pid=".1440.4/1">I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. The allegations included one that my right hon. Friend the Minister would not come to the House, as if she had not just been in front of the Home Affairs Committee, answered the private notice question, dealt with Home Office questions at the beginning of last week&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Of course, we took it for granted. I am merely advising colleagues about the allegations that she had not done so. I heard those allegations on the radio. One can say things on the radio and be heard.

	<p pid=".1441.3/1">I entirely agree. But let me now return to Mr. James Cameron, because the allegations are genuinely serious and require action.</p>
	<p pid=".1441.3/2">I said that Mr. Cameron had been at a meeting with one of my senior officials in Bucharest at the beginning of March. Shortly before that meeting, a clearly undesirable lawyer had been arrested. As the shadow Home Secretary said, the lawyer has been involved in fraud and unacceptable illegal dealings relating to entry to this country from Romania and Bulgaria. This individual was picked up at the end of February, a week before the e-mail was sent, and will appear in court on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-29">29 April</phrase>. That was part of the ongoing National Criminal Intelligence Service work that Mr. Cameron was generous enough to mention at the end of his e-mail.</p>
	<p pid=".1441.3/3">I have mentioned both the NCIS work and the lawyer's arrest to show that, far from being behind the door, my officials, the enforcement agencies and all concerned have been working assiduously to try and ensure that the right things are done. One of the allegations&mdash;that lawyers were not being pursued, and the enforcement and intelligence agencies were not doing their job&mdash;was quite simply untrue. If it is true that staff in Sheffield were dealing with matters in an unwarranted fashion, we must look into that, and look into who gave the instruction. I agree that low-level staff should not be blamed for what is not of their making.</p>

	<p pid=".1441.5/1">I will in a moment, but I want to finish the point.</p>
	<p pid=".1441.5/2">In February, middle managers in Sheffield were concerned about fast-track clearing from Bulgaria and Romania, so they reverted to more detailed assessment. I have announced today that we are stopping all entry from Romania and Bulgaria, because that should be done while we get this right. When I met the Romanian Prime Minister last year, we stressed&mdash;as we stressed to the Interior Minister two weeks ago&mdash;that part of the movement towards full accession and the lifting of visa regimes from Romania and Bulgaria would depend on getting to grips with criminality, illegal and forged documentation and an atmosphere and culture that lead naturally to suspicion.</p>

	<p pid=".1442.0/1">My right hon. Friend speaks of necessary measures, but in the long term is it not right to bear it in mind that many immigrants from Romania have made a great contribution to the United Kingdom&mdash;not least Mr. Bernat Hecht, the father of the Leader of the Opposition, who cannot be blamed for the subsequent sins of his son?</p>

	<p pid=".1442.1/1">I certainly do not want any of my sons to be blamed for my activities.</p>
	<p pid=".1442.1/2">Let me put this on record. As soon as the lawyer was arrested at the end of February, staff in Sheffield&mdash;sensibly, from their point of view&mdash;not only suspended dealing with cases that had been handled by him, but recalled those that had already been dealt with. Our staff are caring. They do give a damn. They wanted to get this right, and&mdash;I say this very forcefully&mdash;they were not under instructions from any Minister to do other than follow the procedure, deal with the law and uphold what we would consider to be decent, proper, professional standards.</p>

	<p pid=".1442.2/1">A few moments ago, the Home Secretary spoke of his dealings with the Romanian Prime Minister last year, and a strong reprimand&mdash;my word, but I think that it summarises the position reasonably&mdash;or warning to him about the dangers of improper practice in relation to visa applications. If the Home Secretary made those remarks to the Romanian Prime Minister at that time, presumably he did so following advice from officials in or around Bucharest, and from his own Department. If he had that advice, why did Mr. Cameron's revelations this month apparently come as a surprise that required a complete reversal of policy?</p>

	<p pid=".1442.3/1">The specific allegations made by Mr. Cameron go much further than allegations made previously. The e-mail does not simply say what Mr. Cameron said to my senior official at the meeting, or what was said to his immediate colleagues. In the light of that, and in the light of the mistrust, misapprehension and concern that now exist among the public&mdash;understandably, given what they have been reading&mdash;it is sensible to try and bottom this once and for all.</p>
	<p pid=".1442.3/2">Yes, I did know that there were difficulties. Jointly with the Foreign Office, we had a conference here in London attended by Prime Ministers from all over south-eastern Europe. The publicity is on record and shows that we discussed the real issues of organised crime that we debated here yesterday afternoon. I was surprised that the revelations came after that statement rather than as part of it, because we are dealing with exactly the issues of trans-border and cross-border organised criminality that we discussed yesterday. It is because of such issues that we are establishing the serious organised crime agency. We have been aware of them, and the Romanians themselves are aware of them. That is why they have been prepared to work so closely with NCIS and to have our staff working with them on both immigration and border controls and on drug enforcement.</p>

	<p pid=".1443.0/1">My right hon. Friend has made one of the most sensible points that we have heard in all this. In the context of migration from south-east Europe, we know that we are dealing with criminality and possibly even with terrorism. The allegation that our right hon. Friend the Minister of State would collude in that is not just ridiculous but goes so far over the top that I think Opposition Members should consider their own position. Having alleged a lack of integrity on the part of our right hon. Friend, unless they can demonstrate that she had a motive, the charge is not against her but against the Opposition Front Benchers.</p>

	<p pid=".1443.1/1">My hon. Friend has put his finger on a central issue. If, for the fourth time, there is a call for my right hon. Friend's resignation, on what basis is it made? To substantiate it&mdash;having not substantiated the three earlier calls&mdash;those issuing it would have to show that she had authorised or condoned the actions that Mr. Cameron alleged to be taking place, which are now to be investigated and about which a further allegation has been made this afternoon by the shadow Home Secretary. There has to be some route back from the authorisation or condoning of the sort of gross illegality that has been alleged. That is why I agree that making allegations is easy, but providing facts to back them up is much more difficult.</p>

	<p pid=".1443.4/1">I am grateful to the Home Secretary for giving way. He has now twice told the House that on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-08">8 October</phrase> one of his senior officials went to Bucharest to investigate what was going on there. Was that a routine investigation and, if not, why was the Sutton inquiry not asked to investigate those matters, too?

	<p pid=".1443.5/1">I said that my senior official went on 1 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-02">2 March</phrase>, and I pointed out that the Sutton review was about the first of the spurious allegations and was being investigated. The subsequent allegations, including those made in the e-mail sent on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>, but not revealed by the shadow Home Secretary until last night, were an entirely different issue. I have already said that the blending of all the different issues together is understandable as clever politics, but it is wholly a tactic rather than a reality of fact.</p>
	<p pid=".1443.5/2">I have therefore disentangled points one, two and three this afternoon. We dealt with the first through the review; the second and third were spurious and, in any case, conformed to the practice of previous Home Secretaries&mdash;of which, incidentally, I approve and take responsibility for. The fourth is now about to be investigated. Those are all nothing more than allegations against a Minister who has done so much to reinforce our border controls, and to tackle&mdash;she will announce it in a few days' time&mdash;months of work on sham marriages, bogus student applications and the lack of proper controls that we inherited from the previous Government. She has done a fantastic job on turning round the asylum system. Of course, our opponents, who have to move on to the next issue, have tried to present what we have been doing in getting a grip on the system as a shambles.</p>
	<p pid=".1443.5/3">Those who have made the allegations this afternoon have failed to make their case. They have failed to demonstrate the facts and failed to demonstrate again and again that calls for my right hon. Friend's resignation were justified. That is why we stand four-square behind her. We are getting to the truth by all means and reassuring people that we know what we are doing. We are ensuring that we have a balanced nationality, immigration and asylum policy, and we are proud of the work that we have been able to do so far. We are determined to ensure that no one undermines that policy, whether through illegal activity outside our country, through sloppy work inside it, through lawyers&mdash;I have indicated that a lawyer has been arrested&mdash;or through a failure of enforcement.</p>
	<p pid=".1443.5/4">All of that will be taken into account in the review, but, in the end, we have to make a judgment. Has the Minister of State done a first-class job? We all know that she has, so the answer to that question is yes, yes, yes. That is why she has our unequivocal backing and will continue to do so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1444.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" speakername="Mark Oaten" colnum="1444"  time="013:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-12.htm#40330-12_spnew5">
	<p pid=".1444.0/1">This is a serious debate, and I am glad that the Home Secretary has acknowledged that some of the issues raised, particularly in the most recent allegations, are indeed serious. I wish to examine the allegations in some detail and also examine some of the operations taking place in the Department, particularly those of the immigration and nationality directorate. There have been calls for the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration to resign, so I shall also look at some of the reasons behind those demands for her resignation.</p>
	<p pid=".1444.0/2">Before I go into the detail, I would like to make a general observation about the climate in which the debate is taking place. I am convinced that if we did not live in a society where issues of migration, asylum and immigration were sometimes deliberately muddled and confused, and where we had to respond to so much nonsense in the tabloid press, some of the misunderstandings and the actions of individual civil servants would not have happened in the first place. In a climate where politicians and Ministers are so frightened to explain transparently and in some detail what they are planning to do&mdash;in other words, their precise intentions on asylum and migration&mdash;the real issues will be buried and hidden away, leading to the sort of confusions that have emerged over the last couple of weeks. I believe that all sides have a responsibility to improve the quality of debate on asylum and migration issues, so that we do not end up with the sort of debate that we are having now&mdash;a debate that is the consequence of the climate in which we live.</p>
	<p pid=".1444.0/3">Clearly, the allegations that have emerged over the past three or four weeks are of serious concern. This country cannot have a system of immigration that is open to different levels of interpretation in different Government offices and that is not transparent. The House should be able to know exactly what Government policy on immigration is and we should not allow decisions to be taken, as it would appear, without clear ministerial approval.</p>
	<p pid=".1444.0/4">The issues are complex and hard to understand, so I want to look in detail at the three basic allegations that have been made. The first could be described as the Moxon/Sheffield set of allegations. In layman's terms, they suggest that a policy was in place to fast-track in-country applications from EU accession country nationals. It is alleged that rather than going through the usual detailed paper process, a simpler application base was used and that the policy was put in place not necessarily to deal with a three-month backlog, but from day one in order to speed up the process. Sutton has investigated that and I am happy to accept Sutton's conclusion that, on the specific allegations made by Moxon, the Minister did no wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".1444.0/5">The second allegation can best be described as <i>The Sunday Times</i> memo. It was written by Graham Austin and Moira Bing to senior immigration officials at the casework directorate at Croydon. Again in layman's terms, it suggests that there is a policy to waive through immigration applications if they take more than three months and that those applications are for a range of permits&mdash;family visits, spouses, domestic workers and so forth. The memo stated:</p>
	<p pid=".1444.0/6" class="indent">&quot;As there is a large number of applications that are over three months old waiting to be decided it has been agreed at ministerial level that an enhanced procedure should be undertaken to clear these as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1444.0/7">It goes on clearly to state that the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration approved the exercise. It is alleged that there was a new procedure for fast-track applications. Even though that was not examined by the Sutton inquiry, I am prepared to accept the Home Office view that it was not a new policy, but standard practice which had been applied to in-country applications for some time.</p>

	<p pid=".1446.0/1">For further clarification, the particular minute dealt with my intervention in the case of Mrs. Martin, which Members will recall arose about a year ago. Mrs. Martin was an American woman who came here with her British husband after the second world war. She had lived here for 40 years and had several children. Under BRACE, taking a decision on the basis of the papers, Mrs. Martin's case for settlement was refused because she could not prove that she had lived in the country for 40 years. I intervened to say that that was not a sensible decision in cases such as hers. I said that such a refusal on the basis of the papers under BRACE should be referred to a senior caseworker to ensure that it was a sensible decision.</p>

	<p pid=".1446.1/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for clarifying that point.</p>
	<p pid=".1446.1/2">On the second allegation, which relates to <i>The Sunday Times</i> memo, I accept the Home Secretary's assertion that this procedure has been in place for some time. However, I have two concerns, the first of which relates to the word that he used yesterday on the Floor of the House. He said that such applications were &quot;substantially&quot; in-country applications. It would help if he clarified what he meant by &quot;substantially&quot;. As I understand it, some 80 per cent. of applications are in-country, which means that some 20 per cent. are not. It is important that we do not simply assume that, in all such cases, we are simply recycling the numbers.</p>

	<p pid=".1446.4/1">So, these applications are not just in-country applications. We need to acknowledge that a number of outside-country applications are involved.</p>
	<p pid=".1446.4/2">The third allegation, which is by far the most serious, relates to the Cameron e-mail, as we might best describe it. Cameron clearly claims that normal checks were being waived in respect of certain countries that are among the next wave of EU member countries, and the Home Secretary is right to say that that claim is serious. Cameron's memo states that</p>
	<p pid=".1446.4/3" class="indent">&quot;no right-minded entry clearance officers would consider issuing a visa to these applications&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1446.4/4">That hard-hitting statement raises a number of serious issues and, as the Home Secretary has acknowledged, concern also exists about the activities of certain lawyers. The Cameron memo also states that there is evidence that one lawyer helped more than 500 applicants. Incidentally, such help cost each client between &pound;1,000 and &pound;2,000. Those are serious allegations, and I should make it absolutely clear that we have no time for a system that allows clearly bogus applicants to fast-track the system in that way. We are also extremely concerned about the activities of certain lawyers, and when the Minister responds I hope that she can say a little more about what is being done to crack down on them. It is clear that a rip-off is taking place in some of those countries, and that there is another, hidden story behind the detail.</p>
	<p pid=".1446.4/5">Those are the allegations, and although I accept that the Minister does not have a case to answer in respect of the first two, there is a strong need for a proper inquiry into the third. I am disappointed that the Home Secretary did not acknowledge that such an inquiry should be independent; instead, he wants to establish another internal Home Office inquiry.</p>

	<p pid=".1447.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we need to examine how a climate has been created within a Government Department in which such short cuts can be contemplated?

	<p pid=".1447.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point that touches on my opening remarks.

	<p pid=".1447.2/1">I congratulate the hon.

He talks about the need for a proper debate, but does he agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1034" name="Andrew Lansley">the hon.

	<p pid=".1447.3/1">There are surely some among the so-called official Opposition who believe that this issue will help them to win votes at the next general election. However, it did not seem to do the Conservatives much good when they raised it during the 1997 and 2001 elections. So one of three allegations is serious and worthy of investigation, and I say again to the Home Secretary that I am disappointed that such an investigation will not be independent.</p>
	<p pid=".1447.3/2">I turn to the allegation that is not talked about, but which constitutes the wider problem: the underlying culture within the Departments and the way in which they are run. The Sutton report considered this issue in some detail and raised a number of concerns. It is a great pity, incidentally, that the report was pushed out last week, on a day when endless Government announcements were made. As a result, it did not receive the coverage and detailed examination that it deserved. Sutton revealed a serious breakdown in the managerial process. Some of its recommendations are quite remarkable. Recommendation No. 5 says that the immigration and nationality directorate should produce for all staff a guidance note outlining how IND policy is developed. That is breathtaking. No Department should need to produce guidance notes on its own policy. If such guidance was necessary, it should have been provided ages ago, rather than being provided now in the form of a recommendation.</p>
	<p pid=".1447.3/3">Recommendation No. 6 says that all staff new to IND at grade 7 or 6 should undergo training on policy and working with Ministers. It is breathtaking that such policy guidance and training was not in place to begin with. The fact that it was necessary for an internal inquiry to recommend that training be given to staff on how to work with Ministers illustrates that a complete failure has occurred.</p>

	<p pid=".1448.0/1">The hon. Gentleman's point reinforces what I said earlier, and describes the difficulties that officials encounter in interpreting Ministers' policy guideline wishes. As a result, a breakdown in communication occurs, and such a breakdown is surely squarely the responsibility of both the Minister and the Secretary of State.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1448.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" speakername="Mark Oaten" colnum="1448"  time="013:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-13.htm#40330-13_spnew8">
	<p pid=".1448.1/1">One of two things is being demonstrated. The Department failed because proper training was not in place and policy guidance was not given to officials in the first place; or Ministers' new guidance is so complex, or it changes so quickly, that front-line staff have been unable to keep up. Whichever of those is true, it is clear that something has gone wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".1448.1/2">Recommendation No. 7 is also breathtaking. It says that technical expertise should be included for those deciding cases. Of course it should. The implication&mdash;that those deciding cases did not have the technical expertise in the first place&mdash;is astonishing. If we are to have confidence in the system, the individuals involved in complex cases should have such expertise in the first place. Why were they allowed to do what is a complex job for such a long time without the necessary skills and knowledge? We should not need to wait for an internal inquiry to come up with such an obvious and basic recommendation. There is a serious case to answer in respect of that fourth allegation, but Sutton touches on only some of the managerial problems that existed.</p>
	<p pid=".1448.1/3">I want to ask a few questions of the Minister and the Home Secretary, and to discuss the list placed by the Home Secretary in the Library last night concerning the backlog clearance process that has taken place since the 1980s. I acknowledge that that principle and that process began under Conservative Governments, but does the Home Secretary not accept that his Government have gone further than the Conservatives in respect of backlog clearing? Why was it decided that the BRACE scheme would kick in only after a 12-month delay? He has changed the guidelines, and the scheme now kicks in after a three-month delay. Is that not a clear acknowledgement that the system is getting out of control?</p>
	<p pid=".1448.1/4">Can the Minister say more about the plan to tackle the clear pressure to which the IND is being subjected? In his Library note, the Home Secretary said that he believed that the introduction of charges for applications on leave to remain would give the IND an opportunity to invest more, and to move towards &quot;high standards&quot;. It is true that from <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-01">1 August 2003</phrase>, there has been a big increase in the charges for applications. Can the Minister explain where that money is going, how much money has been raised by that increase in the charge and how much money has gone directly to improving the quality of IND and exactly how many extra staff will be employed? There is clearly a pressure, a backlog and a burden on staff, and I hope that the Minister can explain how many additional staff will be employed to clear that backlog.</p>
	<p pid=".1448.1/5">What is the position of the so-called whistleblowers? Where do Mr. Moxon and Mr. Cameron stand in relation to their employment? Are they both under investigation? What kind of hearing will they have? Have either of them broken any codes that they signed in relation to employment? Based on what I have heard in relation to Mr. Cameron, I have concerns about the way in which a consul or other diplomat, who must surely be privy to extremely privileged information, has operated in sending that e-mail.</p>
	<p pid=".1448.1/6">While I want a system in place that protects whistleblowers, I acknowledge that some individuals, especially in consulates or embassies, hold positions of enormous trust. I do not necessarily argue that the two individuals who have been referred to should be reinstated. That is one of my concerns about the Conservative motion, which implies that those individuals should be praised as heroes and reinstated. I do not take that line, but I hope that the Minister will explain that they will be treated fairly and under which codes of conduct they will be processed.</p>

	<p pid=".1449.3/1">I do not accept that. Clearly, in this case, the individuals did not feel able to go to senior managers and they decided to send e-mails in a different direction. So there has been a problem with the process, and the climate in the Department is not one in which individuals feel that they can go through the proper process. For whatever reasons, the individuals involved felt that they had to go to the tabloid press or Opposition parties. So there is a problem that needs to be addressed.</p>

They should understand that those Ministers will be bombarded by endless e-mails.

I am on the record as saying that I met Mr. Moxon in the morning and it was clear to me that he was a troublemaker. Just a few alarm bells started to ring in my mind. They did not seem to ring down the corridor in a different office. However, the Conservative Front-Bench team seems to have learned a lesson in relation to the Cameron e-mail. I accept, as the Home Secretary accepts, that it was right not to draw conclusions immediately from an e-mail&mdash;e-mails are not signed&mdash;but to take some time to check out the source. So on this occasion we can excuse the Conservatives for the delay in responding.</p>

	<p pid=".1451.1/1">The phrase &quot;cover-up&quot; can be interpreted in many different ways. When it comes to the serious matter of asking a Minister to resign, do we believe that a general allegation that the Government have covered something up is a resigning issue? I argue that it is not. All Governments manage their stories to put across the best message. For goodness sake, if people had to resign for doing that, none of us would be left in this Chamber.</p>

	<p pid=".1451.3/1">Not even me.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.3/2">I move on to the timing in relation to the applicants who were so close to the <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase> deadline and EU accession. I understand that in a busy office with a pile of papers to go through one might say, &quot;What is the point of rejecting this application when in just a few months, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>, this national will have full EU membership? Let's just let this one go through.&quot; But the Government have a policy of taking other applications right up to the <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April</phrase> deadline. They have made it clear that for asylum applications from the Czech Republic the deadline should be <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April</phrase>. Surely there has to be some consistency. What guidance is being issued in relation to applicants from countries that are just a couple of weeks away from becoming EU members?</p>
	<p pid=".1451.3/3">The Home Secretary has announced that he is suspending all immigration applications from Bulgaria and Romania. Is the Minister comfortable with that? Has the decision been legally checked? Is the process legal? Does she believe that the decision could be challenged legally? If it is legal and necessary due to the concerns of the Home Office, does she believe that there is a case for widening it to apply to other countries? Is she sure that the kind of practice that Mr. Cameron has exposed in Bulgaria and Romania is not taking place in other countries? Surely there is a case for the investigation that the Home Office has announced into those countries to be expanded to consider practice in other countries; otherwise, we may have to have another debate in six months' time, after we have had another leaked memo from a different consul in a different part of the world.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.3/4">I come to the sensitive issue of the Minister's position. I have found the Minister to be able and polite, and during the passage of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill, my colleagues and I found her to be open, frank, honest, helpful, clear and plain-speaking. I have nothing but respect for the Minister. I have never, in seven years of doing this job, called for another politician to resign. That is done on a knee-jerk basis, far too often and I am uncomfortable with the constant calls for individuals to resign. However, on this occasion, I have had to consider the issue, because the press have asked me endlessly whether I support the Conservatives' calls for the Minister to resign.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.3/5">In considering the issue, I have had to analyse several points. First, did the Minister ignore warnings from officials? The Sutton inquiry found that she did not ignore the warnings on the specific allegations and that in fact some of those warnings did not get through to her. On that ground, there is no case. Secondly, did the Minister mislead the House? That is one of the most serious allegations that can be made and is a reason for individuals to resign if they have done so. Again, despite some of the comments in the memo in <i>The Sunday Times</i> about the Minister knowing about the process, I am clear that there is a difference between her authorising that process and the allegations that were made when she came to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.3/6">Thirdly, has the Minister got to grips with the management process? Sutton does set out some concerns about what is taking place in the Department. I know that the Minister has said on the airwaves that she has been responsible for sorting out the chaos and introducing procedures to try to improve matters. However, she still has a case to answer on some of the problems in her Department. Fourthly, should a Minister be held to account for managerial failures? That is the most complex and difficult question because increasingly Ministers say&mdash;with some justification&mdash;that something is an operational issue, and not a ministerial responsibility. However, the extension of that argument leads to questions of where democratic accountability lies and where the buck stops. There are concerns that the Minister has not got to grips with the managerial process.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.3/7">In the circumstances, it does not appear to me that a case can be made for the Minister to resign. That is why we have not supported such calls. However&mdash;and I hope that the Minister and the Home Secretary will consider this&mdash;because of the public concern about what has happened in the Department, Ministers should agree to a full inquiry into the Cameron allegations, and a broadening of the remit of Sutton to examine the procedures in place in the immigration and nationality directorate. The concerns are so severe that a wider independent inquiry should take place. The Minister's future should be decided after that, and not in the hothouse of the television studios or the Chamber where it is too easy to call for resignations.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.3/8">Those of us who wish to speak tolerantly about asylum and immigration&mdash;who wish to argue that the country is not going to be flooded and that we should have a mature debate&mdash;are undermined enormously if the information and figures from the Government are not accurate. That does not help us in making our case. That is why a full, independent and public inquiry into the facts should take place.</p>

	<p pid=".1453.2/1">I am sorry to have to speak in this debate, because I had hoped for better from a Tory party led by the child of someone who was a refugee from Romania. However, if one has any expectations of the Tory party, one is frequently disappointed. My right hon. Friend the Minister is being pursued as part of a deliberate strategy by the Conservatives to stir up antipathy towards people coming to this country. The Conservatives do not give a damn about the damage that that does to community relations. As far as they are concerned, a few cheap hits in the House of Commons are worth it, even if they result in some expensive hits on the streets and estates of this country. Those of us who represent constituencies where various communities manage to live happily with one another&mdash;including intermarrying&mdash;are disgusted by that approach.</p>
	<p pid=".1453.2/2">If people think that I exaggerate, all that I can do is remind them&mdash;as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1309" name="Tom Watson">the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson)</phrase> has already done&mdash;of the stated views of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1034" name="Andrew Lansley">the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> when he was director of the Conservative Research Department, even though he is now a shadow health spokesman. He said that immigration was</p>
	<p pid=".1453.2/3" class="indent">&quot;an issue which we raised successfully in 1992 and again in the 1994 European election campaign. It played particularly well in the tabloids and has more potential to hurt&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1453.2/4">to hurt whom? It might hurt the Labour party or the Liberal Democrats, but it will hurt most&mdash;many&mdash;of our fellow citizens and people who come to this country to try to earn a decent living in peaceful circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".1453.2/5">All over the world, since history began, there have been huge movements of population and they have always presented great difficulties. However, they have been a huge asset to this country. A book published a few years ago, with the strange title &quot;Hitler's Gift&quot;, listed all the geniuses whom he drove out of Germany and eastern Europe to this country and north America. They transformed the standard of our mathematics and physics, and we left Germany and eastern Europe far behind. That was a permanent legacy.</p>
	<p pid=".1453.2/6">We should also consider the people who have come to this country more recently and the benefits that they have brought to our fellow citizens. For example, Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub is the world's greatest heart surgeon and he is welcome. He contributes, and so do hundreds of thousands of other people who have come to this country and made it a better place. We should make them welcome, instead of indulging in cheap stunts in pursuit of Ministers, in the hope of some short-term, shoddy political gain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1454.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" speakername="Frank Dobson" colnum="1454"  time="014:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-15.htm#40330-15_spnew4">
	<p pid=".1454.1/1">No, I have only 12 minutes and I intend to use them.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/2">The Government inherited a huge mess in immigration and asylum, with huge delays. The Conservatives apparently confused the amount of time taken to deal with applications with thoroughness, but the two are not necessarily related. The process was not thorough, but it did take a devil of a long time. The Government have set about tackling that problem and have faced enormous difficulties in doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/3">Things have gone wrong, and I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister&mdash;and she is a friend&mdash;will not take offence if I say that the Home Office and the other Departments involved did not cover themselves in glory in relation to events at Morecambe bay and the warnings given by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1233" name="Geraldine Smith">the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith)</phrase>. We cannot blame an individual Minister for the failure of four Departments to co-ordinate their activities properly. If everybody in the House, on both sides and in all parties, had listened to what Joan Maynard and Dick Body said about gangmasters 20 years ago and had done something about it, those events would never have happened. We cannot blame my right hon. Friend for those failures, because she was not even a Member of Parliament at the time.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/4">My right hon. Friend has an awful job, but it is done more efficiently than it has been in the past. I have been a Member of Parliament for 25 years and I know that she achieves a good turn-round on the innumerable letters that I send her. I do not know what else she can manage to do besides answering my letters, because her replies are always thorough and accurate. I believe that other Members write to her, too. She is in a terrible position; when she makes a decision she is denounced by some people as illiberal and by others as limp-wristed and weak, because she has let all sorts of &quot;villainous&quot; people into the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/5">Now we have the Tory party jumping on the bandwagon with a leak from Sheffield. In an excellent speech, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" name="Mark Oaten">the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)</phrase>, asked whether the Sheffield civil servant had broken a code of conduct. He may have broken such a code if it turns out that he has pulled a political stunt with the Leader of the Opposition. It is against the civil service code of conduct for a civil servant to appear at a political stunt with the Prime Minister, so it would probably also be the case if he did so with the Leader of the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/6">The Tories are trying to link that to the advice that work permit applicants from the immediate accession countries should be &quot;waved through&quot;, because it is so close to when they will be entitled to enter the country anyway. I have news for the Tory party: there is nothing new in that. The Tory party may have no corporate memory, but as the Leader of the Opposition was involved, he should be able to remember that the Home Office acted in the same way in 1995 when Austria, Sweden and Finland were about to join the EU. As we were never told, we do not know whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman was unwilling, in the words of the motion, &quot;to take responsibility&quot; for the policy, or whether there were &quot;dishonest internal workings&quot; in his Department. He certainly kept quiet about it. Of course, he could say that he was following another Tory precedent, because exactly the same thing happened when Spain and Portugal were accession countries in 1986. As the period of accession drew nearer, the easier it was to enter this country, and eventually work permit applicants were &quot;waved through&quot;, but that policy was not disclosed.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/7">As has been mentioned, in 1992&ndash;93, when the Leader of the Opposition was Home Secretary, 20,000 people whose applications would otherwise have been turned down were given exceptional leave to remain, yet nothing was said about that. We found out that it had all been done secretly only when the figures were published some years later and had to be explained.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/8">Of course, there are well organised scams. Indeed, I turn from scams to scum, because the people who organise the trafficking of their fellow human beings are among the scummiest people in the world. It appears that some of them are involved in what is going on in Rumania and Bulgaria and we need to check that and sort it out&mdash;and it will be sorted out.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/9">There is a wider point, however. We are talking about people who are applying for work permits. They will receive a work permit only if we do not have people qualified for the work for which they require the permit. Work permits are going to people in the construction industry, to electricians and plumbers. Why do we not have enough of those workers? It is because the stupid Tory Government, under Mrs. Thatcher, abolished apprenticeships and sold off the training centres that could have trained the skilled people whom we now lack.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/10">The Tories did not train enough doctors. They cut back on the training of nurses and reduced the number of nurses in training. Despite all that, they had planned to hold a debate later today&mdash;until they suddenly, opportunistically, chose to change the topic&mdash;about Labour's failure to prepare for doctors' reduced hours. The Tories reduced doctors' hours, but they did not increase the number of doctors to compensate for that. That is how we got into a mess, and the Labour Government are trying to get out of it.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/11">When Nigel Lawson was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he mocked our calls for more and better training. He said that the jobs of the future would not necessarily be high-skill or low-skill, but that they would be no-skill jobs. As a result, we have a lot of people with no skills and they are the ones who find it hardest to get a job.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/12">Today, we see the complete hypocrisy of the Tory party. The Tories left the immigration service in chaos and the Government are improving it. As for blaming officials, we shall take no lessons from the Leader of the Opposition; blaming officials was his stock in trade. The House will remember the famous interview when he said that he was responsible for prisons policy but not for operations. Paxman asked him again and again and again whether he took responsibility for operations in the Prison Service and he denied it. That is another reason why we shall not tolerate this lousy, opportunist, second-rate, smeary effort from the Tories today. [Hon. Members: &quot;Say what you mean.&quot;] One of these days, I shall say what I really think about them.</p>
	<p pid=".1454.1/13">I want to say something very serious: if this sort of stirring up against people goes on, Islamophobia will grow. Our fellow citizens will be assaulted because they wear a scarf around their head. They will be spat at as they take their children to school and they will find life more and more difficult&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1456.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/797" speakername="James Clappison" colnum="1456"  time="014:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-16.htm#40330-16_spnew1">
	<p pid=".1456.1/1">I look forward to the day when we hear the frank and unvarnished opinions of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/2">Control over borders should be a high priority for Members, in today's world more than ever. Many of our constituents say that there can be fewer high priorities and they expect us to hold the Government to account for the security of our borders and the soundness of the immigration system.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/3">When something goes wrong, as it has plainly done on several occasions, we need to find out how bad the breakdown of the system is, the extent of what has gone wrong, how long it has been going on and the number of cases affected. Notwithstanding the remarks made from the Treasury Bench earlier, it is clear that something went wrong in the Sheffield department of the Home Office. Indeed, I thought that had been accepted on both sides of the House, but as I listened carefully to the Home Secretary earlier he seemed to be rowing back. He seemed to be trying to suggest that all the allegations made by Mr. Moxon had been disproved and that the Sutton report, to which I shall return in a moment, had completely exonerated the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/4">On Mr. Moxon, there seems to be an attempt in certain quarters to play the man rather than the ball&mdash;something with which we are all far too familiar. Whatever else may be the case about Mr. Moxon, his allegations turned out to be right. The Minister admitted that to the House and said that the procedures that had been followed would be withdrawn, so we do not need to go over that ground today. However, I remind the House that the Government's case then was not that everything was above board and that everything was going right; they said that something had gone wrong but that it was an isolated matter involving local guidance. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>, the Minister told us that she knew nothing about what had gone wrong at the Sheffield office.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/5">Today, we have heard new allegations that put a rather different complexion on the information that the right hon. Lady gave the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase> and the Select Committee on Home Affairs the next day. They also overtake the Sutton report, which she set up&mdash;an internal inquiry by a senior civil servant from her own Department, albeit from a different part of the Department, but still an internal inquiry. The matters that have come up over the last day or so clearly overtake the Sutton report, whose remit restricted Mr. Sutton to looking into a particular range of issues in the Sheffield office. In the final report, which I have read, Mr. Sutton emphasised, above all, that the context for his inquiry was a limited proportion of the casework of the immigration and nationality directorate. That was what he put first and foremost.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/6">The suggestion that the Home Secretary has confirmed in large measure today is that, in fact, the issues run much wider than those considered by Mr. Sutton and that there was far more irregularity than just that which he considered, covering far more issues. As Mr. Cameron apparently put in his e-mail&mdash;one could not do better than this&mdash;what was revealed at the Sheffield office earlier this month was just the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot;, and we now need to look at how much of the iceberg remains beneath the surface. Not only is the Sutton report completely overtaken by what has emerged subsequently, but the new matters, which are partly admitted at least, put a completely different complexion on what the right hon. Lady told the House and the Home Affairs Committee earlier this month.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/7">The right hon. Lady told the House that the relaxed procedures employed by the Sheffield office, about which Mr. Moxon complained, related to people who were already legally in the country and who were seeking to extend their stay. In her statement to the House, she emphasised:</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/8" class="indent">&quot;It is worth remembering that, principally, the people affected were already lawfully in this country.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-03-08.1245"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 March 2004; Vol. 418, c. 1245</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/9">Yet in the new allegation, backed by documents, the case is clearly made that relaxed procedures were employed for such people, at least in Romania and Bulgaria, when they sought to enter the country in the first place.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/10">According to Mr. Cameron&mdash;the man behind the report&mdash;the procedure involved thousands of applications from those seeking to enter or settle in Britain as students, spouses, au pairs, domestic servants, working holiday makers and dependant relatives of migrants already here. If that is right&mdash;it seems to have been admitted that it is right&mdash;I am afraid that it does not tally at all with the impression, given by the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>, that those involved were already in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/11">The Minister needs to tell us just what the state of her knowledge was about the allegations made by Mr. Cameron at the material time. If what Mr. Cameron is saying is right, the defences were down at every stage of the immigration control proceedings. They were down when the applicants applied to enter, and they were down again when people already in the country applied to the Sheffield office to stay.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/12">How the fraud was dealt with is even more serious. Again, what has transpired puts a completely different complexion on what the right hon. Lady told the House. When she spoke in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>, she was at pains to dismiss the question of fraud altogether. I remind her of her words:</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/13" class="indent">&quot;There was no question of staff being instructed to grant such leave to those whom they believed to be fraudulent.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-03-08.1245"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 March 2004; Vol. 418, c. 1245</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/14">Breaking away from what she said, we know from what Mr Cameron said that fraud was very much an issue. I have only seen reports of the e-mail sent from the British embassy in Romania, but it would seem that fraud was very much an alarming issue in the case of both Romania and Bulgaria. According the reports that I have seen, the e-mail says:</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/15" class="indent">&quot;both countries were until March 1 overwhelmed with badly prepared bogus applications. When entry clearance officers write to Sheffield and state clearly that the application is being supported with forged and counterfeit documents the letters are ignored and the applications are still being issued&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/16">We have heard more details about that, the involvement of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, and the extent of bogus applications and irregularities among the legal profession.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/17">I shall ask the Minister some questions that she has to answer today. Was she aware of the allegations being made by Mr. Cameron when she made statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>? Was she aware of what he said then? If so, how can she possibly justify the way in which she dismissed the question of fraud out of hand, as she did not only on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase> on the Floor of the House, but in her evidence to the Home Affairs Committee?</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/18">I turn now to the memo that we have heard about in a separate allegation. The right hon. Lady told the Home Affairs Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-09">9 March</phrase>&mdash;the day after the statement&mdash;that the backlog had arisen as a result of matters that took place in the previous autumn. She referred to the BRACE procedure, but she said that it was a longstanding approach to backlogs that simply allowed caseworkers to use discretion if all the papers in certain cases, possibly marriage cases, were not there.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/19">The memo, which has apparently come from two senior civil servants in the Minister's Department, clearly refers to an enhanced BRACE policy that was implemented in July 2003, with, it is said, the specific approval of the Minister. If so, it puts an entirely different complexion on what she told the Home Affairs Committee, when she said that the policy was not implemented until later last year and that it arose because of backlogs. Was she aware of that memo? Was the memo true? Was the policy implemented with her agreement in 2003&mdash;not in response to an individual case, as she told the House in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" name="Mark Oaten">the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)</phrase>, but on a much more widespread basis than she admitted to the hon. Gentleman?</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/20">The memo of July 2003 says:</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/21" class="indent">&quot;As there are a large number of applications that are over three months old waiting to be decided, it has been agreed at ministerial level that an enhanced procedure should be undertaken to clear these as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/22" class="indent">This note confirms that the decision in this case has been taken under an enhanced procedure for clearing backlog cases, which commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-14">14 July</phrase>, 2003.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1456.1/23">Why did the Minister not refer to that memo when she appeared before the Home Affairs Committee? She had something to say about BRACE and the backlog procedures. Does the memo not put an entirely different complexion on the evidence about the Sheffield problems that she gave to the Home Affairs Committee?</p>

	<p pid=".1458.1/2">The Minister said that the Sheffield matters were all locally determined by staff and had arisen as a result of local problems with a backlog later in the year, but the policy was decided centrally and agreed by Ministers. The right hon. Lady should deal with the question of what she knew about the BRACE procedure and the enhanced procedure in 2003. She should also deal with what she knew about Mr. Cameron and his allegation that the iceberg would have remained completely unknown if it had not been for my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench. They deserve congratulations for bringing this matter to light. They have done a public service, and I commend them on the way in which they have brought the issue to the attention of the House. They are right to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".1459.4/1">No, I will not give way because time is limited.</p>
	<p pid=".1459.4/2">I am particularly pleased to support the work that my right hon. Friend the Minister has done in pushing forward improvements to the asylum system. An awful lot of what is needed in her job is exceptionally unglamorous and does not involve big policy decisions; most of it relates to putting in the proper procedures, seeing them through and getting the systems working. She has done that extraordinarily well, and certainly the recent moves that she has made have produced real benefits for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".1459.4/3">Shortly after I was elected, I went to look at some of the asylum procedures that were in place in my constituency. A number of people were arriving there, but we inherited the system from the Conservatives, and it was the most ramshackle, non-system that I had ever seen. There was a completely farcical approach to the payment of benefits, there was no networking between the different agencies, and the Conservatives' idea of new technology was a pencil sharpener. There was no proper system for identifying the people who were claiming asylum and receiving benefits. For a party that talks tough about identity cards, it was astonishing to see the total failure to identify properly the people who were coming in and out, claiming benefits and moving around the system. There was also a complete denial of the fact that many people were coming into the country and claiming asylum. If there were not scams then, that was partly because one did not need to run an effective scam to work through what was a totally shambolic system.</p>
	<p pid=".1459.4/4">The Labour Government have increasingly put steps in place that have improved the system, and my right hon. Friend the Minister has pushed them through. For example, a new system was put in place for asylum support. Certainly, it faced problems, but it was a distinct improvement on the shambles that we inherited from the Conservative party. A range of different identification documents and cards are in place and they will establish who people and their dependants are. Those documents can be relied on and they replace the lack of documentation in the previous system. There has been an increase in the number of decisions taken, and they have repeatedly been reported to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1459.4/5">There has also been an increase in the number of removals. Any Member who visits their police station can ask the police officers there about the number of removals that they have to deal with. There has certainly been in an increase in the number of removals going through Northampton. There has also been open discussion about managed migration, which relates to the points that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)</phrase> made about ensuring that we have the people to do the jobs that others simply do not want to do.</p>
	<p pid=".1459.4/6">In my constituency, there has been, particularly recently, an increase in the number of enforcement actions taken. For example, a successful raid took place today on a factory that employed illegal migrants. Fifty-seven people were stopped and, so far, 33 of them have been arrested and will be removed. I very much welcome the increase in such actions.</p>
	<p pid=".1459.4/7">It is certainly true that there is further to go. The Conservative party has highlighted a scam, but it is not the only scam that has ever existed. There should be proper recognition that circumstances have changed over the past couple of years and that an increasingly and extremely sophisticated international industry is engaged in trafficking and the forging and sale of documents. That has made it extremely hard to tackle some of the problems that we confront.</p>
	<p pid=".1459.4/8">I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister shares my concerns about the proliferation of forged documents, and I know that she and her Department are also working to tackle the problem. An examination of the forged documents in the possession of the immigration and nationality directorate at Croydon and at Heathrow make it clear that they are produced to an extremely high standard and put through a sophisticated market. However, there is an increasing problem of documents being obtained through apparently legal means and then being used by different people. There are increasing problems of impersonation, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will put more resources into dealing with the appalling problem of forgeries that are part of a huge international trade. The people detained today in my constituency were found to be travelling on false documents.</p>

	<p pid=".1461.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that all these issues are real and that this Government have tackled them by putting in more resources and getting the organisation right? The last thing we need is any future Government threatening cuts in those resources. That would make it impossible in future to tackle the problems created by new technologies.</p>

	<p pid=".1461.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. I was just about to come to that point.</p>
	<p pid=".1461.1/2">The Conservative party has been extremely good at talking the talk in the way it did before 1997. It absolutely refused to put in place the steps and procedures that were needed to deal with the problem. Just as it did not have proper procedures for dealing with benefits, it did not have the proper documentation available to check on who people were, or the proper new technology in place to enable the different agencies to network properly. It also refused to support openly the proposals that my right hon. Friend the Minister and colleagues introduced to improve and speed up the legal procedures, so that we could deal with claims, in particular false claims, more quickly. Rather than just talking about the problems, we need to ensure that there is proper support in place for the solutions that the Government are putting forward.</p>
	<p pid=".1461.1/3">My right hon. Friend is tightening up on the procedures to prevent abuse of the legal system, but there is also a need for the Law Society to deal with some of the problems created when certain lawyers handle such cases. It is noticeable that the case in Bucharest involved lawyers who were taking substantial sums of money for processing many claims that they must have known were false.</p>
	<p pid=".1461.1/4">I very much welcome the steps that have been taken so far. My right hon. Friend has done more than any other Minister who has held her position to tighten up the procedures, to take difficult decisions and to see them through. I hope that she will continue to do that in exactly the way she has done previously. The public must also realise that, if the problems of asylum and immigration are to be dealt with properly, it will take tough decisions and proper resourcing. Cuts of the type proposed by the Conservative party will not suffice, and impractical proposals such as parking people on offshore islands, are complete nonsense. It is only by clamping down on the procedures while dealing with the issues of properly managed migration that my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras mentioned that we can allay people's fears and make for a civilised society that has decent race relations and sound systems.</p>

	<p pid=".1462.3/1">I am enormously grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene so early in his speech. For clarification and my peace of mind, will he justify the shadow Home Secretary's use of the word &quot;collusion&quot;? I should like to learn four things from the debate, one of which is the justification for the use of that word by the shadow Home Secretary.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1462.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/777" speakername="David Cameron" colnum="1462"  time="014:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-17.htm#40330-17_spnew11">
	<p pid=".1462.4/1">Much of my speech will be about the Minister's role, so I shall try to answer the hon. Lady's question during it.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/2">We have learned three important things. First, Ministers seem reluctant to get to the facts. The Home Secretary told us that Mr. Cameron&mdash;no relation, I stress&mdash;the official in our Bucharest embassy, met Home Office officials on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-01">1 March</phrase>. We need to know who was told about his concerns. Why were they not examined by the Sutton inquiry? We need to see the minutes of the meeting between Mr. Cameron and the Home Office official so that we can find out who knew what and when. If Ministers wanted to get to the facts, the Sutton inquiry would have covered that straight away.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/3">Secondly, Ministers seem reluctant to take responsibility. The Home Secretary said on the radio this morning that Ken Sutton will now widen his inquiry, go to Bucharest and examine the matter further, which is important. He also said, as he repeated in the House, that no Minister would resign&mdash;there will be no scalps. What will happen if Ken Sutton finds that Ministers were responsible in some way and that they knew something but did nothing about it? The Home Secretary has effectively prejudged his own inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/4">We learned a third important fact from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>: that our embassies in Sofia and Bucharest had written to the Home Office raising important concerns. The most important question that the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration must answer is whether Ministers saw those letters. If they did but did not act, they are to blame for much of what has gone wrong. If they did not see the letters, does that not prove that we need a wider inquiry, worthy though the Sutton inquiry is? I am sure that Ken Sutton is a great man, but we need a proper independent inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/5">I wanted to speak in the debate because immigration and asylum are of long-standing interest to me. I am not some Johnny-come-lately to the subject, although Labour Members say that we are interested in the matter only because of the politics. I worked in the Home Office, I have served on Committees that have considered asylum and immigration Bills and I am a member of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. I have asked the Minister questions about the Moxon affair in that Committee and the Chamber, but I have not been satisfied by the answers that I have received. I do not believe in pursuing Ministers for the sake of it. We did that with the former Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions; he has gone and what benefit was that? We must try to get to the truth.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/6">I agree that the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration has what I once described in <i>The Guardian</i> as the &quot;job from hell&quot; in having to deal with all inquiries. I do not pretend that a Minister with thousands of civil servants can be held responsible for every last thing that they do. However, I have seen events unfold from relatively close at hand, so I know that the way in which the Government have handled the matter has not been impressive in any sense.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/7">Let us be absolutely clear about what has happened throughout the saga. First, the policy on entry clearance for one group of people was being operated by officials without ministerial knowledge. That is clearly evidence of a failing Department&mdash;we have heard further evidence from my Front-Bench colleagues about its failure today. The Minister herself said about the Sutton report:</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/8" class="indent">&quot;This report makes clear that the current system of management and lines of accountability in parts of IND are not good enough&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/9">as I said, we have a failing Department.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/10">Next, we find out that the whistleblower&mdash;Mr. Moxon&mdash;told the Minister's private office that the policy has been introduced, but he received no response for more than two months, which is evidence of a failing private office. As she told the Home Affairs Committee:</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/11" class="indent">&quot;That was a failing in my office, there is absolutely no doubt about that&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/12">We know from the Minister's mouth that as well as a failing Department, we have a failing private office.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/13">The whistleblower then went to the press. <i>The Sunday Times</i> called the Minister's press office and the Home Office made several denials. Its final denial said:</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/14" class="indent">&quot;There have been no changes in procedures or dip in the level of scrutiny applied by case workers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/15">That was simply not true, because as the Minister admitted at the Dispatch Box on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/16" class="indent">&quot;The response from the Home Office to the press reports on Friday . . . was wrong.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-03-08.1247"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 March 2004; Vol. 418, c. 1247</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/17">As well as a failing Department and private office, we have a failing press office that actively misleads the press. In the same statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>, the Minister said that the lapse in scrutiny was &quot;rare and untypical&quot;&mdash;those words are important.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/18">Next, the Prime Minister backed up the Minister during Prime Minister's Question Time by saying:</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/19" class="indent">&quot;the issue is simple: a practice developed in&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/20">the Home Office</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/21" class="indent">&quot;that should not have developed . . . I am trying to put the matter in context because it is not the case that it involves hundreds of thousands of people a year. It almost certainly involves only a very small number of people&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-03-10.1516"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 March 2004; Vol. 418, c. 1516</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/22">He repeated the line that the problem was a rare and untypical one in the Home Office. However, we know that it was not rare and untypical and that the accelerated procedures were applied to other groups. As the leaked memo in <i>The Sunday Times</i> said:</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/23" class="indent">&quot;all applications as far as possible over 3 months old should be granted . . . This exercise has been agreed by the Minister of State, Beverley Hughes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/24">No one can doubt that the matter is serious.</p>
	<p pid=".1462.4/25">From what I have seen, a clear picture emerges of complacency among Ministers, of them not wanting to get to the facts and of them having the truth pulled out of them slowly, bit by bit. Let me give two examples of that.</p>

	<p pid=".1464.1/1">I have given way to the hon. Lady once; I am trying to answer her question at length.</p>
	<p pid=".1464.1/2">First, in the Minister's response to the urgent question on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>, did she tell the House that accelerated procedures were being applied to other groups of applicants for residency in this country? No, she did not. Did she answer questions about that matter from my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden and others? No, she did not. Did she deliberately give the impression that the situation was rare and untypical? Yes, she did. If the Minister had come to the House to apologise for what had happened, announce a proper inquiry and talk frankly about the problems of dealing with backlogs, the Home Office would not be in the mess that it is in now. The way in which she made her statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase> was a genuine misjudgment.</p>

	<p pid=".1464.2/1">The hon. Gentleman talks about misjudgment and backlogs. Was it a misjudgment in 1992 and 1993 when the backlogs were wiped out by the Conservative party?</p>

	<p pid=".1464.3/1">If we were to have a proper debate, we could talk about a time when we had a Home Secretary who actually cut crime and had a decent asylum and immigration policy with fewer applications than at present, but that is not what we are discussing today.</p>
	<p pid=".1464.3/2">The scope of the inquiry that the Minister set up shows a second profound misjudgment. Part of her Department is failing, and her private office and press office have been shown to fail. There are huge question marks over the extent to which the accelerated procedures for migrants have been applied. We know that much more widespread concern exists, including that expressed by our embassies in Bucharest and Sofia. However, what was to be covered by Ken Sutton's inquiry? Would it cover her private office? No. Would it cover the press office that deliberately misled the press? No. Would it examine initially how far the accelerated procedures for granting immigration went? That was not the case to start with because there had to be a second announcement about the inquiry on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-12">12 March</phrase>. A third extension of the Sutton inquiry was announced on the radio this morning by the Home Secretary when he said that Ken Sutton is going out to Bucharest. The situation is utterly unconvincing. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" name="Mark Oaten">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden and the hon.

	<p pid=".1465.1/1">He was polite as well. The Minister has lost the confidence of many of her officials because she has blamed them for what went wrong. She has certainly lost the confidence of much of the press because her press office has completely misled it. She has lost the confidence of many MPs because she simply has not given us full answers.</p>
	<p pid=".1465.1/2">The question for the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister is: if one has a Department and a private office that have failed, and if there is more and more evidence of chaos in the system and clear evidence that a wider inquiry is needed, is the Minister of State the right person to turn matters around? I find it hard to believe that the answer to that question is yes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1465.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/852" speakername="Parmjit Dhanda" colnum="1465"  time="015:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-18.htm#40330-18_spnew8">
	<p pid=".1465.2/1">I am sure that I am not the only person in the Chamber to remember the episode of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; in which Sir Humphrey remarked that almost all Government policy was bad, but frightfully well carried out. I do not think that that is the case in this instance. Today we must ask with whom responsibility lies when a policy is right, but not carried out properly.</p>
	<p pid=".1465.2/2">Let us not mistake the broad consensus&mdash;I think that there is probably some consensus on both sides of the House&mdash;that the basic policy is right. I hope that there is some agreement that this country needs hard-working migrants to boost our economy and enrich our society. When my parents came here in the 1960s, they were part of a generation of immigrants who helped to build up our public services. Likewise, prospective immigrants today, if they have qualifications, skills and a willingness to work, should be welcomed&mdash;and, yes, even fast-tracked.</p>
	<p pid=".1465.2/3">Today's dispute is about the implementation of such a policy and the ways in which my right hon. Friend the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration should be held responsible for errors in that implementation. Unfortunately, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> advanced an argument the conclusions of which bear no relation to its premises. The Opposition cite the principle of ministerial responsibility, by which they mean the Minister taking responsibility for officials' actions that contradict the very policy set out by the Minister. Not only do the Opposition blame my right hon. Friend personally, but they claim that the only way in which she can exercise responsibility for it is by resigning. That is simply not the case.</p>
	<p pid=".1465.2/4">Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the actions of their officials. They can be and are held accountable through questioning and public debate, as has happened in the present case. Ministers might have to explain in the House what has been done by an official, and that, too, has happened in this case. That is the convention, that is what my right hon. Friend has done in the House, and that is what has been examined in some detail by Ken Sutton. None the less, the Opposition allege that responsibility must, at all times and in all places, equal a resignation. No offence is considered too far removed from a Minister's private office. The claiming of a ministerial scalp seems to be the most important&mdash;indeed, the only&mdash;thing that the Opposition are willing to accept.</p>
	<p pid=".1465.2/5">The Tories' rationale for demanding that my right hon. Friend leave office was unwittingly revealed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1150" name="James Paice">the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)</phrase> last night on &quot;Newsnight&quot;. He told Kirsty Wark:</p>
	<p pid=".1465.2/6" class="indent">&quot;It is difficult for this government to accuse us&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1465.2/7">that is, the Tories&mdash;&quot;of popularity.&quot; I would not dream of accusing them of such a thing. However, in the present case, they are guilty of ham-fisted and unprincipled opportunism.</p>

	<p pid=".1466.3/1">Let me make a little more progress, then I shall be happy to give way.</p>
	<p pid=".1466.3/2">In my view, when the shadow Home Secretary received the e-mail in question, he should have reported it to the Home Office straight away. Instead, he decided to wait three weeks. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire tried to explain the inordinate delay by claiming:</p>
	<p pid=".1466.3/3" class="indent">&quot;We needed to check out the email before handing it over. We needed to check if the allegations were accurate.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1466.4/1">I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is misattributing remarks. The point that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> and I have made, time and again, is that we needed the time not to check the accuracy of the statement&mdash;we were in no position to do so&mdash;but to check the e-mail's provenance. All we knew was that we had an anonymous e-mail; we had to find out its provenance and determine whether its author had some justification for making the allegations set out within it. That is totally separate from authenticating its contents.</p>

	<p pid=".1466.5/1">I believe that if the hon. Gentleman found evidence of a burglary or a murder, he would not act as judge and jury himself, but would report that evidence to the authorities immediately. The Opposition chose not to do that in the present case, and although the hon. Gentleman has given his reasons for acting as he did, I disagree with them. The Opposition stood back and calculated the political gain that they believed they would score from delaying for some weeks. They put the e-mail in the public domain only yesterday, repeated its allegations today, then&mdash;feigning indignation&mdash;they called for the resignation of my right hon.

	<p pid=".1467.0/1">The hon. Gentleman appears to be in conflict with the Home Secretary, who this morning accepted that my right hon.

Of course, we had no knowledge as to its authenticity until the Foreign Office interviewed Mr. Cameron and suspended him, and he then telephoned my right hon. Friend's office. That was the first time that we were certain that the author of the e-mail was anyone who knew what they were talking about.</p>

	<p pid=".1468.2/1">The debate raises two issues. The first is the pattern of behaviour of Ministers, which began with denial, followed by grudging acceptance when finally they were faced with documentary evidence of what they had previously denied. That was then followed by denigration and suspension of the whistleblowers. They moved on to protestations of ignorance of what was happening in their Departments, and in the end they blamed officials. Above all, and most wrong of all, Ministers refused to accept responsibility for the actions and inactions of their Department. In my view, to blame officials is despicable, to claim ignorance is culpable and to deny responsibility is intolerable.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.2/2">It is not only the Minister of State. The Home Secretary behaved with apparent chivalry by clasping the right hon. Lady to his bosom but, in fact, he was using her as a human shield. He must ask himself who is ultimately responsible in the Home Office for policy and who will take responsibility. The position of the Home Secretary must itself be under question. I suspect that the Prime Minister will move the right hon. Gentleman from his present post before too long. Anyway, there must be an independent inquiry into what has happened under his stewardship of the Government's policies.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.2/3">Far more important than that is the policy that is being pursued by the Home Office. Most people imagine that its policy on immigration is to restrict immigration to what is necessary for family reunions, for meeting shortages that cannot be met until we have trained indigenous people to meet the requirements of particular jobs, and for bringing in people with company-specific knowledge necessary for the functioning of their companies, for example.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.2/4">We learn, however, that there has been a transposal of policy. The basic thrust of what is happening in the Home Office is to facilitate and encourage immigration to this country. I say that advisedly, and not only because of the devastating revelations about particular eastern European countries that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> set out. The Department has set a target to boost the number of people asking for work permits to come into this country: from a figure of about 47,000 in 1997, it has set a target of 200,000 in the current year.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.2/5">I asked the Minister, on the day after she made her statement, a series of questions. I asked what the targets were within the Department. Characteristically the right hon. Lady has not answered. Is that because she does not know the answers to the questions that I tabled for answer within five days or is she withholding them until after this debate, as has been done so many times before?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1469.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1050" speakername="Peter Lilley" colnum="1469"  time="015:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-19.htm#40330-19_spnew13">
	<p pid=".1469.3/1">No. I am not going to give up more time.</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/2">The Government are actively encouraging people to bring other people into this country. They have reduced the rate of refusals from more than one in eight under the Conservative Government to fewer than one in 20 of those who apply to come here. We have seen how they are colluding in the exploitation of loopholes. The particular loophole that was the origin of all this was the requirement under the accession treaties to allow people to come from the accession countries to the UK to establish businesses. That was not meant to allow people to come to this country as office cleaners and describe that as setting up a business.</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/3">In his report, Mr. Sutton says:</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/4" class="indent">&quot;A typical case would be a Romanian student coming to the end of their course in this country and planning to set up in business as a cleaner.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/5">Should we be allowing thousands of people&mdash;possibly tens of thousands&mdash;to do that? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1062" name="Stephen McCabe">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe)</phrase> seems to think that that is amusing, but most people do not believe that that is the purpose of the immigration service.</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/6">The reason why we have such backlogs that constantly have to be dealt with by accelerated procedures is that there is a growing number of applications&mdash;about 500,000 according to the Sutton report. The reason why there are so many applications is that the Government have made it easy and speedy to get into the country, unlike the position in most other countries. Consequently, more people apply and they overwhelm the system.</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/7">It has become clear, too, that the default position in the Department is to let people in rather than to deny them entry: if they do not provide sufficient information, let them in. The document says, &quot;If they don't supply a bank statement, let them in. If they don't have other information about their national insurance and so on, let them in.&quot; Surely if people cannot or do not provide the information that is requested of them, they should be refused entry. That should be the default position.</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/8">My constituents, by and large, want a restrictive immigration policy, and that includes people of all ethnic groups there. I have had representations from ethnic minorities in my constituency to the effect that they would prefer a stricter and firmer immigration policy. The reason my constituents want that is certainly not because they hold racist views. They accept it when I say that the bulk of the people who want to come to this country, be they asylum seekers, economic migrants or even illegal immigrants, are basically decent people who want to better the lot of themselves and their families. But they know, as we surely all know, that this country is too crowded to be a country of net immigration.</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/9">Apart from the Netherlands, England is the most densely populated country in western Europe, yet for the first time in our history we have one of the highest rates of net immigration and it is being deliberately encouraged by the Government. We see the consequences in our constituencies. The bulk of the people who come to this country come to London and the south-east. Accommodation has to be provided for them. The Government admitted in response to a question that I tabled that 85 per cent. of the growth in population that they expect over the next 30 years&mdash;5.6 million extra people&mdash;is the result of net immigration. That is one of the major reasons that there is pressure on housing accommodation and public services in the south-east.</p>
	<p pid=".1469.3/10">Unless and until the Government and the Ministers concerned are prepared to make the immigration service do what it ought to do&mdash;restrict immigration to those who need to come to this country, not encourage it on a large scale&mdash;there will not be the public confidence in the Home Office that there ought to be.</p>

	<p pid=".1471.0/1">The Minister and I have had many dealings together in Committee and across the Floor of the House. Throughout my dealings with her, I have found her courteous, kind, helpful and efficient and I make no challenge whatever to her personal integrity. But today she and the Home Office face two central charges. The first is that Ministers have presided over an increasingly chaotic and shambolic asylum and immigration system that, after more than seven years of the Government, is universally condemned throughout the country for its inefficiency. The first charge is massive incompetence.</p>
	<p pid=".1471.0/2">The second charge is more serous and it is this: in order to persuade the general public that all is well when plainly it is not, Home Office and Foreign Office officials are encouraged, if not ordered, by someone somewhere to manipulate the system, to operate it improperly and to behave improperly, in an attempt, first, to please their political masters and reach the targets they have been set, and secondly, to persuade the general public that everything is under control, when plainly it is not.</p>

	<p pid=".1471.3/1">May I add another reason to my hon. Friend's two? Is there not a fundamental constitutional issue? Under our eccentric constitutional arrangements, we have the Executive sitting in Parliament. Unless they are prepared to be accountable to Parliament, they are not performing their proper constitutional function. Irrespective of the personality involved&mdash;I was ticked off a moment ago for using a personal name&mdash;unless Ministers are prepared to accept responsibility for their role as Ministers, rather than passing the buck down the line to civil servants, the system breaks down. That may not be important to some, but to me, and I hope to my hon. Friend, it is.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1471.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1089" speakername="Humfrey Malins" colnum="1471"  time="015:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-20.htm#40330-20_spnew4">
	<p pid=".1471.4/1">My hon. and learned Friend is right. It is nothing to do with personalities. It is to do with the office of Minister. Responsibility must be lodged somewhere. It is not right for Ministers continually to blame junior officials when, in truth, the buck stops with the Minister. My second allegation relates to the integrity of the system, which I believe is now at stake.</p>
	<p pid=".1471.4/2">I shall deal briefly with the first allegation&mdash;incompetence. In the Government's first year of office, the bilateral treaty that we had with France whereby people arriving unlawfully on our shores were returned to France lapsed and the Government were never able to renegotiate it. That was their first failure. Partly in consequence, the number of asylum seekers began to rise dramatically. By 2002, we had become the asylum capital of Europe, with well over 100,000 asylum applications in that year, the largest total ever.</p>
	<p pid=".1471.4/3">The Government could not cope properly. That important area of initial decision making was hopelessly neglected&mdash;and is still neglected, according to the Labour-dominated Home Affairs Committee. Life and death decisions are made by officials who receive a mere 27 days' training and a salary of only a little more than &pound;15,000 a year. Proof that the quality of initial decisions under Labour is going down can be found in the statistics. In 2002, 22 per cent. of appeals against their decisions were successful, whereas in the last year of the Conservative Government, that figure was only 4 per cent. Members in all parts of the House&mdash;Members of the Minister's own party&mdash;have roundly condemned the Government for failing to put sufficient resources and expertise into initial decisions.</p>

	<p pid=".1472.0/1">As a former member of the Home Affairs Committee, I remember the dignity with which the hon. Gentleman took evidence. Does he recall taking evidence about the computer system and, more importantly, about the 1,200 redundancies of experienced caseworkers that that situation created, which contributed significantly to the backlog?</p>

	<p pid=".1472.1/1">We are sick and tired of Labour Members discussing so-called failures seven or eight years ago. The Labour Government have been in power for more than seven years, and they should take responsibility for their actions and for their failings.</p>
	<p pid=".1472.1/2">I note that delays are still endemic in the system. More than 10,000 cases a year still take more than eight weeks to get an initial decision. The average time to get from the initial decision to the adjudicator is now some 17 weeks, or more than four months.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1472.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1089" speakername="Humfrey Malins" colnum="1472"  time="015:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-20.htm#40330-20_spnew8">
	<p pid=".1472.3/1">Again, a Labour Member mentions 1997. When will the Labour party begin to take responsibility for the past seven years, rather than continually looking back to the seven years before that?</p>
	<p pid=".1472.3/2">Given that the conduct of the appeal is usually in the hands of the Home Office, a 17-week delay is far too long. Much to its shame, the Home Office is increasingly unrepresented by lawyers or its own presenting officers at hearings before the adjudicator, which causes further delay.</p>
	<p pid=".1472.3/3">Life for the adjudicators has been made even more frustrating by the ability of appellants to include all their human rights claims in their appeal. As a result, thousands of applicants for asylum who fail under the convention are nevertheless permitted to stay and are granted exceptional leave to remain under the Human Rights Act 1998. It is a stark statistic that, in the last year of the Conservative Government, about 3,000 people were granted exceptional leave to remain in this country, whereas under this Government more than 20,000 people have been allowed exceptional leave to remain in each of the past two years.</p>
	<p pid=".1472.3/4">What happens at the end of the day to the failed asylum seeker? In truth, the Government's removals policy has been an abject failure and is widely recognised as such up and down the country. They set themselves a target of 34,000 removals per year, but they have been unable to get anywhere near it and have had to abandon it. The system has been discredited, because four out of five failed asylum seekers know that they can remain in this country, notwithstanding the fact that they have no case whatsoever. One consequence of that discredited system is that the Home Secretary was obliged to grant, as he did last year, an amnesty to about 50,000 failed asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid=".1472.3/5">The Government say that legislation is the answer, but I remind them that the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 had virtually no effect on the system, and the flagship policy of placing asylum seekers in accommodation centres and induction centres has been a disaster. In the past two years, not one accommodation centre has been set up under this Government. They have talked a good case but failed to act.</p>
	<p pid=".1472.3/6">The Government have no clear or effective policy on managed migration. When the Home Secretary was asked to estimate how many people are here illegally, he replied that he</p>
	<p pid=".1472.3/7" class="indent">&quot;has not got a clue&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1472.3/8">On migration generally, he argues, quite wrongly, that there is no obvious upper limit on the number of migrants who could be present in this country.</p>
	<p pid=".1472.3/9">The charge of incompetence is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but the second allegation about the integrity of the system is even more serious, and we must deal with it today.</p>

	<p pid=".1473.0/1">The hon. Gentleman prefaced his remarks by paying tribute to the Minister's competence and personal integrity. Is it just a coincidence that whenever the Conservative party guns for the scalp of a Minister, it happens to be a woman, as was the case with the former Secretary of State for Education and Skills, who is now Minister for the Arts, and with the Minister for Children, and now with this Minister? Was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1317" name="Ann Widdecombe">the right hon.

	<p pid=".1473.1/1">Frankly, that is such an absurd intervention that I will not dignify it with a response.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.1/2">The story of Mr. Steve Moxon, which broke a few weeks ago, should have put the Government on notice that there were serious problems ahead. He is an immigration caseworker who revealed that officials had been ordered to fast-track thousands of applicants with few or no checks on their authenticity. Since November 2002, civil servants have been told to fast-track applications under the BRACE&mdash;backlog reduction accelerated clearance exercise&mdash;procedure. Rather sinisterly, the memorandum said:</p>
	<p pid=".1473.1/3" class="indent">&quot;as this is not a published policy, no reference should be made to this, either to the applicant or his representatives or on the Home Office website.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1473.1/4">That shows that a lot is going on behind the scenes with this Government that we do not know about, and that we should know about. When challenged about it, the Home Office said that there had been no changes in procedures or dips in the level of the scrutiny applied by caseworkers. Pull the other one: the truth is that there have been changes and dips in scrutiny. Unwisely, the Minister told the House of Commons that the case was &quot;rare and untypical&quot;. She would have been much wiser at that stage to acknowledge the seriousness of the allegation and set up some form of independent inquiry right across the Home Office. She went on to tell the Select Committee on Home Affairs that it was absurd to imply that she should be made responsible for this.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.1/5">The second major allegation relates to what took place on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-28">28 March</phrase>, with new leaked documents claiming that the Minister authorised the fast-tracking of applications. The memorandum from two senior officials at Croydon stated:</p>
	<p pid=".1473.1/6" class="indent">&quot;All applications&mdash;as far as possible&mdash;over three months old should be granted, unless the information available on file is such that it can properly and defensibly support a refusal. Where a case will result in a refusal, the case must be cleared by a senior case worker. No further inquiries should be made.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1473.1/7">Significantly, it adds:</p>
	<p pid=".1473.1/8" class="indent">&quot;This exercise has been agreed by the minister of state, Beverley Hughes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1473.1/9">Thirdly, we heard from the diplomat in Romania about what he was instructed to do.</p>

	<p pid=".1474.1/1">No, I have no time: I must move on. I have given way on many occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".1474.1/2">The third serious allegation comes from the British consul in Bucharest, who said:</p>
	<p pid=".1474.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Home Office judgment and decision making with regard to ECAA applications is a continual problem for overseas posts such as Sofia and Bucharest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1474.1/4">He goes on to say that there has been excessive pressure to grant applications that in effect have no merit whatsoever. The truth of the matter is that there are countless examples of cases that those people had to grant when they should never have done so. One example is that of Mr. C, who applied for a visa under the ECAA&mdash;European Community association agreement&mdash;scheme in August 2003. The visa assistant at the British embassy said:</p>
	<p pid=".1474.1/5" class="indent">&quot;We telephoned his company and they told us they've never heard of him and he's never worked for them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1474.1/6">However, the Home Office lost the letter&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;which suggests that the claim was bogus, and Mr. C was granted a visa allowing him into Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".1474.1/7">One example of bad practice would be one thing, and a second example might be thought to be coincidence, but in the past three months we have had three clear examples of a practice adopted across the Home Office that brings the integrity of the whole system into question. It is time that the Government considered a full and independent inquiry, probably by a High Court judge, into exactly what has been going on.</p>
	<p pid=".1474.1/8">The Home Secretary acknowledges that the position is serious, but where does responsibility for it lie? Does he believe that it lies with junior officials? Does he think that it lies with middle-ranking officials? Or does he believe that it lies with senior officials? He would probably reply, yes, yes, yes. It may be slightly old-fashioned to say so, but Conservative Members believe that the responsibility lies with Ministers and that the buck stops there.</p>

	<p pid=".1475.5/1">The Minister must have misheard. I said that all immigrants are hard working, industrious people who want to improve their lot and that of their families. Will she therefore withdraw her remarks? Earlier, she castigated Opposition Members for not conducting research. I tabled questions on the day of her previous statement. They asked, among other things, what targets she had set for processing claims. She has not replied.

	<p pid=".1476.0/1">That is exactly right. The Conservatives do not like hearing about their record in Government, but it is important to recognise the absolute shambles in which they left the immigration department, with no proper systems or management and more than 1,000 caseworkers dismissed on the basis of a computer system that never arrived. I remind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1089" name="Humfrey Malins">the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins)</phrase> that the Home Office was totally unprepared to respond to the Kosovan crisis&mdash;an enormous crisis that led to an influx of people here.</p>
	<p pid=".1476.0/2">It has taken a systematic and radical reform, step by step&mdash;it is not complete yet&mdash;to put that right.</p>
	<p pid=".1476.0/3">The Opposition have criticised us for not being able to say how many people are here. I remind them that the Conservative party in government removed embarkation controls, so we have no way of articulating that. The asylum system had in it, as we have heard, delay after delay, with cases going on for years and years. Secret decisions were taken quietly to grant asylum seekers leave to remain, of which we became aware only later when the figures were published, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/852" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase> pointed out.</p>

	<p pid=".1476.3/1">This is vital to the issue that we are debating. If a report was given to Ministers about concerns in relation to immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria, why was that information not included in the Sutton inquiry when it was set up?

	<p pid=".1476.4/1">If the hon. Gentleman recalls, the shadow Home Secretary did not reveal the memo that would have been germane to the Sutton inquiry. I also remind Opposition Members that the subject of the allegations leading up to my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase> was specifically the eight accession countries and the allegation that Ministers had fast-tracked nationals from those countries in order to beat the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>.

	<p pid=".1476.6/2">I remind Conservative Members of the record of their party in government: no action on border controls, no review of immigration control, no action on people trafficking, and no action at all on the organised immigration crime that fuels much illegal entry. Since moving into opposition, its record has been characterised by hypocrisy. First, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/974" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, on becoming leader, paraded his migrant history. When he was Home Secretary, he and his party argued strongly in favour of EU enlargement, but he has since reversed his position on that. Secondly, he created a storm about our proposals to remove support for failed asylum-seeking families, when he had clearly forgotten that he took away support from all asylum seekers the moment that they claimed, which was overturned by the courts.</p>

	<p pid=".1477.0/1">My right hon. Friend is talking about the record pre-1997. She may recall that in 1997, I and some other Labour Members used the word &quot;amnesty&quot;, and I think that we were told by the then Home Secretary to wash our mouths out with soap and water. The Government then rightly embarked on a backlog clearance exercise, which was made public and which everyone knew about. Can she remind us how many backlog clearance exercises took place in the 1990s, which only came to light when the figures were published two or three years later?</p>

	<p pid=".1477.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend. As he knows, the Home Secretary yesterday put in the Library details of all those exercises that have taken place from 1988 onwards. Apart from the secret one, which was not disclosed at all&mdash;in marked contrast to the exercise that we announced in October&mdash;the other exercises were by and large what any sensible Government or Department would have to do. Backlogs are completely anathema to immigration control. If we have large backlogs, we are not managing the system properly. With proportionate and sensible measures, it makes sense to reduce backlogs as much as we can.</p>

I have here a sheaf of letters, including letters from the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the right hon.

	<p pid=".1478.2/1">In contrast, our record in government shows that we have instituted systematic, step-by-step reforms of asylum procedures. We have reduced the number of claims, there has been a record number of removals, we have speeded up decision making, we have acted on border controls and tackled organised immigration crime, and we have introduced a new charging regime. I repeat that I do not suggest that all the reforms we want are necessary. I am not saying that all parts of the organisation are yet as strong as I want them to be. We have seen over recent weeks that that is not the case. However, we are moving in the right direction, and we have made much more significant progress than the Tory party ever did.</p>

	<p pid=".1478.4/2">Hon. Members have asked me a number of questions. I shall probably not be able to deal with all of them, and I hope that they will allow me to write to them about some of them. In answer to the question about whether there was any reason to suspect that the inquiry would not be legal, I can say that there is no reason to believe that the action we have taken today would be open to legal challenge. We have explored the position, and I think that our action would be generally accepted as a sensible measure. Not only will we suspend applications under the ECAA, for a short period we will suspend all applications for any purpose from Bulgaria and Romania to ensure that we have a complete view of what is happening there.</p>
	<p pid=".1478.4/3">The Home Secretary has dealt with the specific allegations against me in some detail. Let me simply say that I would not be interested in hanging on to office if I knew in my own mind that I had a personal case to answer, because it is what is in my head and on my conscience that matters to me. I would never compromise my integrity or my honesty, and I am not resigning because my conscience is clear. I believe that, working with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, I have made systematic and significant progress in implementing our policy and delivering real change and improvements. I am neither incompetent nor dishonest and I intend to carry on doing my job as long as the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary want me to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".1484.4/1">If the right hon. Gentleman will allow me to develop my theme a little, I will give way to him in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".1484.4/2">The Leader of the House may in the past have belittled the constitution as a tidying up measure. It has always been considerably more than that. That is why the failure to agree it in Brussels in December was greeted with such anger and frustration by Europe's arch-integrationists. Now it is back. I am not surprised: I know how much it means to those in Europe who seek a single European state and who were never going to let it rest. I watched with some amusement the attempts of the Government to pretend that it was off the agenda and was likely to be so for some time. That was always a typical new Labour smokescreen, behind which this coyly integrationist Government could seek to ensure that this integrationist constitution would come back with a vengeance, and with as little time to oppose it as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".1484.4/3">Last Friday ended what must be the most bizarre set of gyrations and about-turns performed by a Government on a major issue for a very long time. It is worth recalling the sequence of events. In 1999, the then Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/817" name="Robin Cook">the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)</phrase>, told the House:</p>
	<p pid=".1484.4/4" class="indent">&quot;For the record, we are not proposing a constitution of Europe.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1999-05-25.184"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 May 1999; Vol. 332, c. 184</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1484.4/5">The Prime Minister, in Warsaw in October 2000, told us that a constitution was &quot;unnecessary&quot;. In Cardiff, in November 2002, the Prime Minister told us that</p>
	<p pid=".1484.4/6" class="indent">&quot;we do need a proper Constitution for Europe.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1484.4/7">Yesterday, according to the Prime Minister, it was apparently anti-European to be against a constitution. Even chameleons do not change their colours that quickly. But this is the party and the Prime Minister who, in 1983, stood on the platform of withdrawal from Europe. Whatever the reasons for the U-turns, high principle certainly is not one of them.</p>
	<p pid=".1484.4/8">Let us consider the past four months. The constitution that the Prime Minister told us last summer was &quot;essential&quot; for enlargement of the EU was suddenly no longer essential in December. We were told that we could get by with the Nice treaty. A &quot;senior Government source&quot;, later unmasked as the Foreign Secretary, remarked last November that a constitution would be &quot;highly desirable&quot; but not &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1484.4/9">Furthermore, if we are to believe the article on page 21 of the <i>Financial Times</i> today, after the failure to achieve agreement on the constitution in Brussels last December, the Foreign Secretary sent a memo to the Prime Minister advising him to do nothing to revive it. That is until last Friday, when suddenly the newly revived constitution was apparently once more essential for enlargement to work. A lawyer or accountant giving such confused advice would quickly be sued for professional negligence.</p>

	<p pid=".1485.0/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman is asking for rigour in these matters, so, given that the draft constitution is only a recommendation to the intergovernmental conference and that that conference has not yet made its recommendations to the legislatures of the member states, how can he know at this stage that the issues for decision would be worth a referendum? Is he not simply whipping up anti-European sentiment to exploit it for party political purposes?</p>

	<p pid=".1485.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman has been in politics for a very long time and he can read the runes as well as I can. Does he really believe that the Irish presidency would have announced that it would return to the constitution without being pretty well assured that everything was signed, sealed and delivered? I think that there will be very few changes, but it will be interesting to see what happens on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-18">18 June</phrase>&mdash;when in this country we shall of course be celebrating the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo.</p>

	<p pid=".1485.2/1">Is not the worry that the constitution is not already signed and sealed, and that the Irish Prime Minister is telling the truth when he says that it is still to be agreed and that further compromises are necessary? It is in those circumstances that it is so important to put the constitution to the people of this country. Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that if that were the Government's position we would not need this debate?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1485.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/697" speakername="Michael Ancram" colnum="1485"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-23.htm#40330-23_spnew6">
	<p pid=".1485.3/1">That would certainly be the case but, unfortunately, that is not where we are. In politics, I am a great believer in starting from where we find ourselves, but I agree that the position outlined by the right hon. Gentleman would have been preferable.</p>
	<p pid=".1485.3/2">Some changes have to be made in the positions that were held in December. For instance, we know that the Spanish and the Polish Governments will have to move from their former position on weighted voting, but all the indications are that both have decided to do so. I may be anticipating the final outcome, but I suspect that I shall be right in my judgment that the constitution will be much as it is now.</p>
	<p pid=".1485.3/3">The only explanation for the twisting and turning of the past months is that the Prime Minister, in his much-vaunted determination never to be isolated in Europe, is fulfilling that ambition by simply going with the flow&mdash;always accepting the position in which the constitution happens to be at a particular time. I have tried hard to understand the Government's position. I have listened closely to the Prime Minister. I quote again from the speech he made in Cardiff on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November 2002</phrase>, when he talked of a</p>
	<p pid=".1485.3/4" class="indent">&quot;one-off opportunity for reform: to set Europe on a clear course for the future, a Europe that . . . can be a superpower&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1485.3/5">In January 2002, according to the Leader of the House, the Prime Minister told his colleagues that the constitution</p>
	<p pid=".1485.3/6" class="indent">&quot;will define the relationship between Britain and the rest of Europe . . . and it would last for generations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1485.3/7">In June last year, the Prime Minister suddenly told Parliament that the constitution</p>
	<p pid=".1485.3/8" class="indent">&quot;does not involve a fundamental change to the British constitution.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-06-18.352"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 June 2003; Vol. 407, c. 352</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1485.3/9">From that series of remarks, one can pick whichever position one wants. They do not give us much confidence that the Prime Minister has a clear view of what the constitution stands for.</p>

	<p pid=".1486.1/1">I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment, but I want to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/2">I have also been listening to the Leader of the House; after all, he was the Minister for Europe for a considerable period. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-21">21 March 2002</phrase>, he told the Convention on the Future of Europe that he was looking for</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/3" class="indent">&quot;nothing less than the creation of a new constitutional order for a new united Europe&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/4">That is very different language from that of the Prime Minister in the remarks I just quoted. Of course, the Leader of the House is the same man who, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-26">26 May</phrase> last year, described the constitution as a &quot;tidying-up exercise&quot;. Once again, on the Government's position, &quot;you pays your money and you takes your choice&quot;. Either the Government, jointly and severally, have no idea what the constitution is about, or they are deliberately trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the British people and of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/5">What we can be clear about is that there is no such ambivalence or confusion across the channel. Our partners in Europe know what the constitution is about. The accession countries have their doubts, as I have discovered on recent visits, but they will be reluctant to push those doubts too far until they are full members. Traditional integrationist Europe&mdash;the Europe of Chancellor Schr&ouml;der and Giscard d'Estaing&mdash;has no such doubts. The constitution is federalist, integrationist and, in their minds, urgent. The Belgian Prime Minister referred to it as the &quot;capstone&quot; of a &quot;federal state&quot;. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-14">14 June</phrase> last year, Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, described it as &quot;worthy of the word historic&quot; and as</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the most important treaty since the formation of the European economic community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/7">Last May, the Danish Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/8" class="indent">&quot;What is at stake is so new and big that it is right to hold a referendum.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/9">Former Italian Prime Minister, Lamberto Dini, said:</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The constitution is not just an intellectual exercise. It will quickly change people's lives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1486.1/11">So why is it that our Government are so alone in arguing that the constitution is not significant? It can only be because their agenda is to try to get us into an integrationist Europe, effectively without anyone noticing. That is why, when they are challenged, as the Prime Minister was by my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, they retreat into spurious and polarising arguments about the choice being not between the constitution and other solutions to the problems of Europe, but between being in Europe or getting out. That is a fraudulent argument, designed to divert attention from the Europe that they really want.</p>

	<p pid=".1487.0/1">I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for giving way, but does he not agree that, even though enlargement could go ahead on the basis of the Nice treaty, the EU will have 25 member states and a multiplicity of texts will make up the treaties, so it is simpler to shrink those texts into a constitution and add a little bit as well, which is effectively what the constitution will do?</p>

	<p pid=".1487.1/1">None of us argues that Nice alone is the perfect way to manage a Europe of 25 states, but I am absolutely certain that a full-blown constitution is not needed to do that. That is the point that we are making, and I shall come to it in a moment.</p>

	<p pid=".1487.2/1">Before we leave the right hon. and learned Gentleman's view of history, will he forgive me for finding it a little difficult to take? Does he recollect that he was the Conservative candidate against me in West Lothian in February 1974? I have the clear recollection&mdash;I do not think that I am wrong&mdash;that he was not a whit behind Edward Heath in being ardent for Europe.</p>

	<p pid=".1487.3/1">I hate to quibble with the hon. Gentleman's memory, but rather than February 1974, when I was fighting in East Lothian, I fought him in June 1970, when the situation was somewhat different. Indeed, I was one of a number of failed candidates who, having lost the election, wrote a letter to a national newspaper calling for a free vote on the accession Bill in 1972. That perhaps underlines the position that I took then and what my view is.</p>
	<p pid=".1487.3/2">Unlike the Government, my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Opposition set out his alternative European vision in a speech that he gave in Berlin on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-13">13 February</phrase>. He spoke of a flexible Europe&mdash;a live and let live Europe that is more co-operative and less prescriptive, more varied and less conformist, based on a completed single market, working together in areas where joint action is beneficial, but able, without tension, to differ where necessary. He spoke of a Europe where the sovereignty of the nation state is the foundation. That is not the Europe of the constitution. Ours is an alternative vision of Europe that we believe is more attuned to the challenges of an increasingly globalised 21st century.</p>

	<p pid=".1488.0/1">Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that the real choice for an enlarged Europe is whether to have a new constitutional treaty or to continue with the existing constitutional treaties? As it appears unlikely that, by the next election, all 25 member states will have ratified whatever treaty is eventually agreed, will he confirm that the pressure for negotiation only extends to any new treaty and that any Conservative Government would not try to reopen the existing treaties on which we function at the moment&mdash;all of which have been negotiated by Conservative Governments of which he and I were members or supporters?</p>

	<p pid=".1488.1/2">My right hon. and learned Friend asks an important question. We have always said&mdash;and we say again&mdash;that had we been in government now, we would have used the period of the negotiation and renegotiation, which has been part of what the convention has been doing for the past two years, to make changes to the existing treaties. For example, we have made it clear for some time that we are not happy with the common fisheries policy; we believe that it is destroying the fishing industry in this country. Had we been the Government, we would have made that part of what we were negotiating in the course of the run-up to where we are now. If there is not a ratified and implemented treaty by the time we get back to government, Europe as a whole will have to look to see what it is going to do in future.</p>
	<p pid=".1488.1/3">One veto prevents the treaty from happening at all. If that happens, we will, of course, have renegotiation just as this Government have renegotiated every time&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Answer.&quot;] I have given the answer.</p>

Presumably we would continue with the existing treaties.</p>
	<p pid=".1488.2/2">My right hon. and learned Friend mentions the common fisheries policy and I am familiar with our position on that. I trust that the fish understand it as well as the fishermen. However, what other things would we negotiate in the existing treaties? Do we intend to open up anything from the treaty of accession, the treaty of Maastricht or the treaty of Nice? What are the other things that we would be seeking to negotiate?</p>

The point is that&mdash;and it is a very clear point&mdash;if, by the time we get back to government after the next election, this treaty has not been ratified by every country in Europe and if we refuse to ratify it, as we would, there will be no treaty. We will then have to look at the current position and the existing treaties and will have to decide what can be kept and what cannot be kept in view of the enlargement of Europe. A whole area of renegotiation will be required. What we have been looking for all along is a simplification of the process in Europe and a simplification of the competences in Europe so that, at the end of the day, it is easier for the people of Europe to understand. I know where my right hon. and learned Friend is coming from, but he is not helping his cause by trying to open questions about the veto.</p>

	<p pid=".1489.0/1">My right hon. and hon. Friends should remember that the Conservative party opposed the Nice treaty and the treaty of Amsterdam, which were negotiated badly by the Labour Government. We object very strongly to this constitution and those treaties for transferring many powers too far from our democratic rights in this country. My right hon. and learned Friend has my full support and that of most Conservative Members in making these points.</p>

I also remind my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> that, at Laeken, the remit given to the convention was to try to simplify the process by which an enlarged Europe would be run and also to reconnect the European institutions with the people of Europe, who are being increasingly alienated from them. That, in itself, was looking for a renegotiation of the way that Europe is run. If we have not got a treaty as I hope that we have not when we return to power after the next election, that is precisely what we shall be returning to.</p>

What would we do if our negotiating points were blocked and we were not able to get unanimous agreement to reopen the treaty of accession, the treaty of Maastricht, the treaty of Amsterdam or the treaty of Nice that comprise the present constitution of the Union?

	<p pid=".1489.6/1">I do not know how my right hon. and learned Friend conducts negotiations, but I always go into them intending to try to achieve what I seek to achieve. When Lady Thatcher was Prime Minister she was told frequently that she was never going to achieve the rebate by negotiation. She went in determined to achieve it and negotiated brilliantly, as my right hon. and learned Friend remembers, and she achieved what she sought. That is the spirit in which we would enter renegotiations if such a situation arose.</p>

	<p pid=".1490.1/1">May I make a little progress?</p>
	<p pid=".1490.1/2">Last Friday, the Prime Minister called for a real debate to dispel what he called the myths. If his call were genuine, he would abandon the myth that we are seeking withdrawal. He knows that that is not true, and when he returned to the point yesterday, he diminished the value of the debate that he wants. He should also abandon the myths that he is not an integrationist and that the constitution is not the gateway to a single European state.</p>
	<p pid=".1490.1/3">Let us consider briefly the constitution. It is no mere charter of competencies of the sort with which we would have been happy, as I said to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe. It does not just define lines and levels of authority, but sets out an agenda: the creation of a political entity that would soon become a single European state. It is a constitution, and states have constitutions. We oppose a single European state, so we oppose a constitution.</p>

	<p pid=".1490.3/1">If the Foreign Secretary thinks that we are talking about a golf club with regard to the constitution, he should study it more carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".1490.3/2">The constitution would create a single legal personality for Europe for the first time. A single legal personality is the hallmark of a state. For the first time, it will constitutionally assert the authority of European law over all national laws and constitutions. Totally contrary to the Government's pledged position, the constitution will incorporate the charter of fundamental rights, give that legal status and make it legally binding. Through the constitution, contrary to pledges made in Britain, the Government have agreed to a separate European military planning capability that will undermine NATO. It creates a five-year presidency and a Foreign Minister with his own diplomatic service&mdash;it is called an external action service to lessen the impact of that&mdash;that will increasingly move powers on asylum and immigration policy to the European Union. The constitution will abolish more than 30 national vetoes, and anyone who says that it is not a centralising and integrationist measure has not studied its details.</p>

	<p pid=".1490.6/1">It was 1964&mdash;I thank the hon. Gentleman, who always keeps me right. The principle was established in the landmark decision on Costa <i>v.</i> ENEL in 1964. The principle of the supremacy of Community law was well known to the Tory Government who took this country into Europe. This country's courts have applied and given supremacy to Community law for 30 years, so what is the big issue about it appearing in the constitution?</p>

	<p pid=".1491.0/1">The simple answer to the hon. Lady's important question is that up until now, the primacy or supremacy of European law over national laws has flowed from treaties that were agreed by nations and could be changed by nations. We are talking about the creation of a constitution from which such authority will flow down. That is a different animal from the previous situation. We emphasise the point because we are talking about a changed animal&mdash;it moves from being a Europe of nations to something much closer to being a nation of Europe.</p>

In fact, the relevant article, III-282, makes it clear that the Court has no jurisdiction only in respect of articles I-39 and I-40. Therefore, article I-15&mdash;the solidarity clause that imposes an obligation on member states&mdash;will be justiciable in the European Court of Justice.

	<p pid=".1492.7/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. The answers that I am trying to secure are coming from my right hon. and hon. Friends, not from the Government. That goes back to what I was saying earlier. The Government do not understand what this constitution is about and what they are trying to get the UK to sign up for. This is a one-way ticket on a line to a single destination. It can be called a step change or a gateway, but it cannot be called insignificant. It shifts sovereignty away from the nation states towards the centre, and in doing so it changes the relationships. I happen to believe that that is dangerous and wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".1492.7/2">We are constantly being told by those on the Government Front Bench that we are alone in our views. However, what about the peoples of Europe? How many of them are straining at the leash for this constitution? How many of them raised their voices in resentment or concern when agreement on the constitution was not reached in December? How many demonstrations have there ever been? We must remember that the whole idea of the constitutional convention was to try to bring Europe closer to the people. It is time that Governments began to listen more closely to what their people are telling them.</p>

	<p pid=".1493.1/1">No. I shall make some progress.</p>
	<p pid=".1493.1/2">Indeed, that was what Laeken was supposed to be about. The task was to reconnect institutions to people, to give them a sense of ownership again. Under Valery Giscard d'Estaing, it did precisely the opposite. Within the constitution it centralised powers, it altered fundamentally the relationship between the EU and its member states, and it moved from a Europe of nations towards something that is profoundly different. That is not what the peoples of Europe want, as we saw from the recent survey, nor what we want.</p>
	<p pid=".1493.1/3">It is apparently what the Government want. If not, why the rush to seek to ratify any June agreement as soon as possible, which I think were the words of the Prime Minister? They have no mandate for this constitution. It was not in the Labour party's manifesto. We will use every parliamentary device to thwart attempts to railroad this wretched constitution through Parliament.</p>

I am finding great difficulty following his position with regard to the relationship between the domestic laws of the United Kingdom and what was Community and is now Union law.

	<p pid=".1494.0/1">I know exactly where the right hon. and learned Gentleman is coming from. He has been very consistent on his views on Europe. The misunderstanding between us is that we are opposed to a constitution because a constitution changes the nature of Europe. The primacy of law that flows from a constitution rather than from treaties, which are signed by individual member states, is a different thing. That is why we are taking the view that we are.</p>

	<p pid=".1494.2/2">There is a simple, fair and democratic answer. That is a referendum that allows the British people to decide. This constitution irrevocably draws sovereignty away from the nation state towards the centre. I passionately believe that no Government and no parliament have the right permanently to alienate the sovereignty of the people without their express consent. That is why I believe that in the current situation a referendum is essential, and that to refuse one is to strike another nail into the coffin of democratic credibility.</p>

	<p pid=".1494.4/1">I really must make progress.</p>
	<p pid=".1494.4/2">I cannot understand the Government's reluctance to hold a referendum unless they are frightened of the result and are frightened of the electorate. They can have no objection in principle. They hold referendums on almost everything else. Can they not understand the resentment that their refusal to hold a referendum invokes? The British people are not to be trusted with such an important decision, we understand. The Danes are, the Irish are, the Dutch are and the Portuguese are. There will be many other countries that will have the courage and honesty to hold a referendum. Apparently the British will not be trusted. That is a patronising insult.</p>
	<p pid=".1494.4/3">If ever there has been an issue where the people have the right to say yes or no, it must be this. The decisions that we are about to take are historic. They will help to shape the future and surely people in such an instance have the right to have a say.</p>
	<p pid=".1494.4/4">The coming European elections, despite the wild assertions of the Leader of the House last August, are no surrogate for a referendum, but I hope that the voters will use them to give the Government the clearest possible message that they want a referendum and that they will not be ignored. The Government should, for once, show some moral fibre, trust the people and let the people decide.</p>

	<p pid=".1495.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, To leave out from &quot;House&quot; to the end of the Question, and to add instead thereof:</p>
	<p pid=".1495.0/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">&quot;welcomes the intensified scrutiny of both Houses in respect of the draft Constitutional Treaty; believes that the Government's policy of active engagement within the EU is in Britain's national interests; supports its constructive approach to discussions within the Intergovernmental Conference to ensure that an enlarged Union works effectively; endorses paragraph 66 of the White Paper (Cm 5934) in respect of issues which must remain the province of the nation state; notes that provided there is a satisfactory outcome on these and other matters of concern, the proposals currently being discussed would not alter the fundamental constitutional relationship between the member states and the Union and therefore does not believe there is reason to depart from previous practice for constitutional treaties; and reaffirms the primacy of Parliament to decide on whether any future Constitutional Treaty should become part of UK law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1495.0/3">I begin by warmly thanking the shadow Foreign Secretary for laying on the debate, which has exposed so acutely the fundamental divisions inside the Conservative party on the European Union and the incoherence of the case that he makes.</p>
	<p pid=".1495.0/4">The Government's overall position on the new draft constitutional treaty was clearly set out in the White Paper, which I put before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-09">9 September</phrase> last year and which stands as Government policy. In making the case for the proposed amendment to the motion before the House, I want to answer four key questions. They are: why is a new treaty needed? What did the Convention recommend? What changes are the Government seeking to make to any treaty to make it acceptable to the UK? What is our approach to a referendum in those circumstances?</p>
	<p pid=".1495.0/5">I shall deal first with the case for a new treaty. As the Union has grown in size, so its functions have developed&mdash;most significantly through the Single European Act, from a customs union to a single market, and through the Maastricht treaty, to take in common foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs, and the single currency. As a result, the texts setting out what the Union is for and how it works are both dated and complicated. Its decision-making machinery is inadequate to cope effectively with 25 and more members, developed as it was for six member states. The treaties that embody the EU's constitution do not explain clearly where the division of powers rests between the nations and the Union.</p>
	<p pid=".1495.0/6">The result of the Convention's labours is to be found in the draft constitution, which I put before the House in August. It revises some of the text, and proposes other changes that are essentially aimed at improving decision making in the Union and in respect of some of its powers. Article I-1 of the draft makes it clear that the EU draws those powers from the member states, rather than the other way round. Article I-9 says clearly that</p>
	<p pid=".1495.0/7" class="indent">&quot;competences not conferred upon the Union. . .remain with the Member States&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1495.0/8">That is the first time that such a clear statement has been made.</p>
	<p pid=".1495.0/9">Article I-59 provides explicitly&mdash;also for the first time&mdash;for member states to withdraw from the European Union, if they so decide. It is not the case, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/697" name="Michael Ancram">the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase> asserted a few moments ago, that if the draft constitutional treaty becomes our law and that of the EU, it will be any different a constitutional animal in terms of international or domestic law from the treaties that have gone before. It is exactly the same in every particular.</p>

	<p pid=".1496.1/2">The draft treaty must be agreed in the same way by a process of political agreement, signature by member states, and then ratification by countries' domestic constitutional procedures. It must be changed in exactly the same way, with this difference: if a member state wishes to leave the EU&mdash;as some Opposition Members wish to do&mdash;a procedure allows them to avoid having to go through the rather complicated and uncertain procedure of renunciation of the whole treaty.</p>
	<p pid=".1496.1/3">We set out in the White Paper our objectives for the intergovernmental conference. Far from trying to hide our position under some bushel, we have been explicit in debate after debate in the Chamber and in the Committees that we have established, in order that Parliament be fully involved in the process, as it should be.</p>

	<p pid=".1496.3/1">In a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/2">We stated at paragraph 66 of the White Paper that we would not sign any treaty that removed the veto for treaty change or for</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/3" class="indent">&quot;areas of vital national interest such as tax, social security, defence, key areas of criminal procedural law and the system of own resources&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/4">In the 10 weeks of the intergovernmental conference process between October and December last year, we sought, and obtained, many important changes to the draft text&mdash;I moved the amendments and got them accepted. We have made it absolutely clear that the so-called European Foreign Minister remains responsible to member states through the Council of Ministers, and is not responsible to the Commission. We reached an agreement on defence co-operation, which will give the EU the capacity to intervene militarily&mdash;which I thought would be welcomed on both sides of the House&mdash;but only in a way that complements NATO, which remains the cornerstone of our territorial defence.</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/5">Among the other changes that we have made, we have altered the so-called escalator clause, which was of genuine concern, by ensuring that further treaty changes can happen only if all national Parliaments, as well as member state Governments, explicitly agree to them. The escalator clause was unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/6">The issue should be of particular interest to the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes. Last October, he was interviewed on &quot;Today&quot;, and he spelled out in his usual modest and understated way how the Government were about to sell out 1,000 years of history. It was put to him that the Government were successfully winning the arguments in the intergovernmental conference on the key areas, to which he said:</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/7" class="indent">&quot;Well, let's test that. Are they&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/8">the Government&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/9" class="indent">&quot;going to get rid of the so-called escalator clause . . . which means that in the future the vetoes can be changed by decision of the Council of Ministers without reference back to Treaties or to national Parliaments . . . If that escalator clause stays in they're whistling in the wind and they know it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1496.3/10">Well, we have passed the right hon. and learned Gentleman's test because we got the escalator clause changed. The draft agreement proposed at Naples satisfactorily changed that part of the treaty, in a manner that I proposed. We will not sign up to any final treaty unless that change, and a number of others, are in it.</p>

	<p pid=".1497.0/1">On the question of which court should have the final say on whether a matter is within the competence of the Union, the Foreign Secretary will know that the House of Lords European Union Committee report&mdash;I am sure that he has read it&mdash;states explicitly:</p>
	<p pid=".1497.0/2" class="indent">&quot;What is new is the classification and division of competences set out in . . . the draft Treaty. The critical question is which court . . . will finally decide whether a matter falls within Union competence. This is not just a drafting question . . . but an issue touching upon the fundamental nature of the Union and its relationship with the Member States.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1497.0/3">In line with the Foreign Secretary's assertion that this Parliament is supreme&mdash;at last he agrees with me&mdash;is not the only answer to introduce a Bill to put the matter beyond all doubt, so that, if Parliament decides that they should do so, our judges will bring into effect any provision that is expressly, clearly and unambiguously inconsistent with the European Communities Act 1972?</p>

	<p pid=".1497.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman every time he makes that proposition. We could have a Bill to that effect tomorrow, and no one could prevent us from passing it if it were the will of this House and of the House of Lords. However, all our actions have consequences, and although he could have such a Bill, he could not be a member of the European Union as it is constituted, and he could not be a member of the European Union as it would be constituted under any future constitutional treaty.</p>
	<p pid=".1497.1/2">I have addressed the issue of primacy with great care because a number of Government and Opposition Members have raised it as a matter of concern. The purpose of the high level of scrutiny that the Government have established is to ensure that, when hon. Members on either side of the House raise issues that are worth pursuing, we pursue them. We did that on energy, for example, which the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1017" name="Jane Kennedy">the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, first identified. That issue had not been identified before, concern was shared on both sides of the House, and we got the article changed satisfactorily.</p>
	<p pid=".1497.1/3">EU law has had primacy over domestic law since the European Court of Justice decision in 1964. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, EU law has had primacy over domestic law since we signed up through the 1972 Act. We have been round this track, and I will not bore the House again.</p>

Now, they are very anxious to advance the issue. In the course of the past week or two, there has been a distinct change in the Government's approach.

	<p pid=".1499.0/1">The Foreign Secretary is identifying the changes in Poland that flowed from the changes in Spain&mdash;which changes were produced by what? We are left with the impression that this Government's policy and approach have changed as a result of the actions of al-Qaeda.</p>

	<p pid=".1499.1/1">Of course I understand the high sensitivity to terrorism in Northern Ireland. I have no wish to subscribe to the view that is current in some circles that the Madrid bombing caused the change of Government in Madrid. All I can say to the right hon. Gentleman is that we will never know exactly what led to the late change in voting intentions in Spain. There have been many other examples of voting intentions changing at a late stage of a campaign. However, Prime Minister Zapatero has said repeatedly that, as far as he is concerned, he won the election as a result of four years of campaigning, not because of the events of four days. The previous Spanish Government might have changed their position after the elections in any event. We simply do not know. To pick up a point that the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes made, we must deal with where we are. It is where we believed that we might be in November and December but happened not to be&mdash;namely, with the negotiations in hand.</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/2">Let me deal with the fourth question, which is about our approach to a referendum. The main case for a referendum is founded on the assertion that a constitution for the European Union will be such a decisive step towards a European superstate that it will end Britain's sovereignty. The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes came close to asserting that this afternoon. Yesterday's <i>Daily Mail</i> put matters in its customary way and stated:</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The constitution will destroy our power to govern ourselves&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/4">It continued by saying that it would</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/5" class="indent">&quot;dismantle Britain as a functioning nation state&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/6">That doom-laden hyperbole is so far removed from the facts that it is tempting to ignore it. However, we cannot do so because that systematic exaggeration of the threat to our nationhood has, over the years, set the framework for a national debate on Europe. So the answer to the question, &quot;Will the draft European constitution end the sovereignty of the nation?&quot; has to be: no. The House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union explicitly stated that</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the draft Treaty makes plain . . . that the European Union remains a union of sovereign Member States&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/8">Its earlier report stated that</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/9" class="indent">&quot;it is clear that the balance of power in the European Union is going to shift from the Commission in favour of the Member States if the&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/10">Convention's &quot;proposals are adopted&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1499.1/11">Of course, that does not stop some Conservative Members wilfully misinterpreting the draft treaty. Let us consider the example of the proposed president of the European Council. The right hon. and learned Member for Devizes said that that was further evidence of development into a nation state, ignoring that there is already a president of the European Commission and a president of the European Parliament. The constitution as drafted will ensure that the Union's agenda is better set by elected representatives of national Governments in the European Council. Instead of the manifest inefficiencies and inconsistencies of the rotating six-month presidency, the member states will choose a president of the European Council to chair their meetings and ensure that their decisions are followed up.</p>

	<p pid=".1500.1/1">No, it is not. It will ensure greater power in the hands of member states against the overbearing power of the Commission. I believed that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would be in favour of it. The president will have no decision-making power. It is striking that only two groups are against the proposal&mdash;the Conservative party and the European Commission. That underlines the incoherence of the Conservative party's position. The proposal means that member states will remove power from the Commission. The right hon. and learned Gentleman should consider its merits instead of dismissing it in the pursuit of a myth about a European superstate.</p>
	<p pid=".1500.1/2">Another claim that the peddlers of the superstate myth make is that the draft treaty massively extends majority voting. Let us consider the reality. The Single European Act of 1986 introduced majority voting for almost all matters to do with the single market. As Lord Heseltine told radio listeners last Saturday, that measure was</p>

	<p pid=".1501.5/1">It has been a Cabinet decision, of course.</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/2">Let me make some more progress. After the Single European Act, we had Maastricht. The shadow Foreign Secretary always tries to forget about Maastricht, and we know why. The Maastricht treaty introduced majority voting to fundamental areas of policy making: the Union's broad guidelines on economic policy; its excessive deficits procedure; education; public health; consumer protection; trans-European networks; overseas aid; and the implementation of decisions within the common foreign and security policy. This was a treaty that John Major proclaimed as</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/3" class="indent">&quot;good . . . for Europe, and a good agreement for the United Kingdom.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1991-12-11.862"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 December 1991; Vol. 200, c. 862</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/4">The Leader of the Opposition and most of the existing shadow Cabinet, including the shadow Foreign Secretary, trooped into the Lobby in support of Maastricht, proclaiming it as a great triumph of European diplomacy. The shadow Foreign Secretary made a wonderful speech in favour of Maastricht&mdash;he did not just skulk into the Lobby following the Whip&mdash;in which he was even moved to say:</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/5" class="indent">&quot;I do not want to find myself in a country that is outside a European superstate, with our industries unable to penetrate it.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1992-11-04.343"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 343</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/6">It is a complicated sentence, but essentially he was saying that on balance he was in favour of a superstate&mdash;which, let me say, I am not&mdash;rather than against it.</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/7">The right hon. and learned Gentleman is adept at switching his position backwards and forwards. We have debated this issue a number of times. I recall&mdash;I am sure that he has forgotten&mdash;that back on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-11">11 December 2002</phrase>, I asked him to refresh the House's memory about whether he had voted on the Maastricht treaty itself and on the issue of a referendum? At column 307, I said:</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/8" class="indent">&quot;am I right in thinking that he voted against a referendum on Maastricht?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/9">The right hon. and learned Gentleman said:</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/10" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State might remember that I was out of the House at the time of the treaty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/11">That is very careful wording, because he may have been out of the House at the time of the treaty, but for sure he was in the House when it came to be considered. He was suffering from the most extraordinary amnesia, because I pressed him again and he said:</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/12" class="indent">&quot;I do not recall a vote on a referendum.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-12-11.307"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 December 2002; Vol. 396, c. 307</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1501.5/13">This was the key and critical issue facing the Conservative party, splitting it apart, and he could not remember whether he was in favour of or against a referendum, even though he had spoken against it.</p>

	<p pid=".1502.3/1">No, but it was my position then. I have been very straightforward about this. Moreover, I do not suffer from amnesia. I am perfectly willing and ready, and always have been, to explain the position that I took. After all, it was entirely public. I was active in the no campaign in 1975.</p>
	<p pid=".1502.3/2">The right hon. and learned Gentleman needs to think about the position into which he is trying to push the Conservative party. He was appalling, even by his own standards, when answering questions put by his right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/802" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. What his right hon. and learned Friend was asking&mdash;and what will be asked right up to the election and throughout it&mdash;is, &quot;What is the Conservative party's policy in respect of the European Union?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1502.3/3">We know what the Conservative party's policy is in respect of this draft treaty, but let us say that for some reason it did not become European law. That is perfectly possible, although I do not know what the odds are. Let us say that we were left with the existing treaties&mdash;the treaty of Rome, the Single European Act, Maastricht, Nice and Amsterdam. Would the Conservatives accept them or not? Most of what they are objecting to today is not in the new constitutional treaty. Most of the provisions to which they object so violently were negotiated by them in 1972.</p>
	<p pid=".1502.3/4">The right hon. and learned Gentleman starts rabbiting on to me about the clause relating to mutual solidarity and loyalty. That is a lift from article 11 of the Maastricht treaty, which states:</p>
	<p pid=".1502.3/5" class="indent">&quot;The Member States shall support the Union's external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1502.3/6">The right hon. and learned Gentleman signed up to that. Is he going to tell the country that he will tear all that up? What process will he employ? How will he deliver on a promise that is easy to make but impossible to fulfil, on the common fisheries policy? He will certainly not deliver on it if he tears up this constitution. The right hon. and learned Gentleman does not have an answer to that.</p>

	<p pid=".1503.1/1">No, I want to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid=".1503.1/2">I said that there were four questions, but there is a fifth, which defies adequate explanation. It concerns the position of the Conservative party. As we know, it is now led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/974" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, his support for Maastricht notwithstanding. He is leading the party towards an anti-European view, which underlines a profoundly defeatist view of Britain's position in the world. Beneath that lies a sense, based on the Conservatives' experience of the Major Government, that Britain lacks influence and will be unable to punch its weight in any international forum, including the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".1503.1/3">The leader of the Conservative party is now calling for a referendum on this treaty. He said before that there had to be a referendum on the Amsterdam treaty, because it was</p>
	<p pid=".1503.1/4" class="indent">&quot;an unacceptable step towards an integrated federal superstate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1503.1/5">I have looked at the Amsterdam treaty again, and I cannot see for the life of me what caused such a fuss. What is it about the treaty that the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes thinks will lead us towards an integrated federal superstate? He does not know, although he keeps quoting it. The leader of his party said that Amsterdam would lead the way towards an integrated federal superstate. Can he name just two or three items in that treaty that would lead the way towards an integrated federal superstate? He cannot name one.</p>
	<p pid=".1503.1/6">There is one thing in the Amsterdam treaty that the right hon. and learned Gentleman might have begun to support, if Conservative Members had even bothered to read it before coming out with this nonsense. The Leader of the Opposition talks of supporting a more flexible Europe, in which groups of countries can come together and do their own thing without necessarily having an impact on other countries. That was in the Amsterdam treaty. It is called flexible co-operation. Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman welcome it or reject it? Every time a treaty has been produced since we came to power&mdash;though never before it&mdash;the right hon. and learned Gentleman and his leader have said that it will take us towards a superstate. Subsequently, however, it becomes apparent that we are nowhere near a superstate, which rather undermines the right hon. and learned Gentleman's judgment today.</p>
	<p pid=".1503.1/7">I gather that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1183" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)</phrase> is half back in favour with Conservative Front Benchers. He said of Nice that</p>
	<p pid=".1503.1/8" class="indent">&quot;the proposed . . . treaty would do what Guy Fawkes failed to do&mdash;blow up parliamentary government in Britain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1503.1/9">Several years have passed since the Nice treaty came into force, and parliamentary Government seems to me to be alive and well in Britain. Indeed, the Conservative party is making use of it.</p>

	<p pid=".1505.4/1">With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, I have never said that it is just an accumulation of treaties. I said rather that it is a consolidation of existing treaties, which partly changes the decision-making process and partly provides for new powers. We need to examine it in each particular respect. I do not subscribe to the Conservative view that we should exaggerate the effect of the draft treaty, but equally I have never sought to minimise it. What we need is a straightforward debate. On any analysis, however, I do say that it involves less significant change than either the Maastricht treaty or the Single European Act. I believe that that is absolutely the case.</p>

I raised it during the intergovernmental conference, and with the legal experts who work for the Council, not the Commission. Their counter-argument is that there is no need to exclude the jurisdiction of the ECJ under article 15 because it has no jurisdiction under that article. Its jurisdiction only arises operationally, under chapter 2 of part 3, and after examining this issue in immense detail I am satisfied that that is so. If I can be convinced that we are wrong&mdash;by just slightly better lawyers than the right hon. Gentleman&mdash;we will reconsider the charge, but there is no issue of principle here. What we need is a mature debate. Rather than creating the myth that this provision will lead to the ECJ's telling the House whether or not we should be loyal to the European Union, or that we should take a different view in respect of Iraq&mdash;such things could never happen&mdash;we should apply ourselves to the text and recognise that much of the wording on the common security and defence policy was first included in the draft not by the Convention, but by those who drafted Maastricht.</p>

	<p pid=".1506.2/1">I am going to close. The myths about the constitution leading to a European superstate are now the stock in trade for today's Conservatives, who would put British jobs, British trade and British influence at risk by marginalising this country within Europe. This is the clear political divide on Europe: between a party of isolation and weakness, and a Government who are getting on with the job of reforming the structures of an enlarged Union, so that it can better deliver on the issues that matter to people. In the light of cross-border threats and of the chance to develop a market with which we do half our trade, the idea that Britain should withdraw into splendid isolation and detachment from the European Union is frankly absurd. We need to engage in Europe to make it more effective at dealing with common threats, and more effective at delivering the jobs and growth that people want.</p>
	<p pid=".1506.2/2">We are negotiating a treaty that, if satisfactorily concluded, will help Europe better to deliver on these issues. The treaty sets out clearly the framework of an effective Europe of nation states. It acts only where its member states have conferred power upon it, and it is able to function more efficiently. Parliament has already been involved in this process to an unprecedented degree, and it will be for Parliament to decide whether the treaty becomes part of British law. I therefore urge the House to oppose the motion and to support the amendment.</p>

	<p pid=".1507.0/1">I doubt very much whether a single vote will be changed as a result of these proceedings, or whether any hearts and minds will be significantly changed either. In a sense, these debates, which have almost become part of parliamentary punctuation, have enabled Members to restate cases that have been stated with varying degrees of eloquence for some time&mdash;at least since the constitution was first mooted.</p>
	<p pid=".1507.0/2">I still have some difficulty with the question of the primacy of European law. I raised this point with the shadow Foreign Secretary, who has another engagement and has apologised for his absence. If such primacy was part of the jurisprudence of the European Community from 1964 onwards, inevitably, by virtue of our accession in 1972, we must be taken as having accepted it. I find it difficult to understand that a distinction is to be drawn as far as the application of that primacy is concerned simply because a document will be produced that asserts it once again.</p>
	<p pid=".1507.0/3">The only way to look at this properly is to put oneself in the position of a domestic judge. Today, a domestic judge faced with an issue to which European Union law is relevant is obliged to apply that law. The day after a constitution or treaty was ratified by this House, that judge would be in precisely the same position as he is today. It seems to me that a wholly artificial distinction is being drawn.</p>
	<p pid=".1507.0/4">My right hon. and hon. Friends will vote for this motion. We do so for reasons that I hope to explain in a moment or two, but I want to make the point that we have consistently argued that a test has to be applied when any question arises of a change in the nature of the relationship between Westminster and Brussels. Looking again, as I did in preparation for this debate, at that test as we have set it out on previous occasions, I freely accept, as I hope others will, that tests of this nature are inevitably subjective; they can never be empirical.</p>
	<p pid=".1507.0/5">The test that we have set out on previous occasions is that if the provisions that the Government eventually bring before the House involve any major shift of control, any transfer of significant powers from member states to European institutions or any alteration to the balance between member states and those institutions, a referendum will be necessary. The Foreign Secretary argues that those criteria are not fulfilled. However, a document such as that which failed to achieve agreement in Rome would necessarily trigger a referendum because in our judgment it would meet the criteria that my right hon. and hon. Friends have set out.</p>

	<p pid=".1507.1/1">As the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, I have great respect for many of his views on this subject, but does he accept that the House of Lords report to which I have already referred says explicitly in the context of the European Communities Act 1972:</p>
	<p pid=".1507.1/2" class="indent">&quot;In short, Parliament did not hand over a blank cheque, legally or politically. The Government should set out their view on the <i>Kompetenz-Kompetenz</i> question clearly to Parliament and to citizens in the UK.&quot;?</p>
	<p pid=".1507.1/3">Does that not imply that it is essential not only that the Government should set out their views but that they should put the matter beyond all doubt by introducing domestic legislation that would ensure that our judges gave effect, if necessary, to clear and unambiguous law inconsistent with the 1972 Act?</p>

	<p pid=".1508.0/1">The hon. Gentleman put that point to the Foreign Secretary. In the interests of brevity, I simply adopt the Foreign Secretary's response and ask the hon. Gentleman to put himself in the position of a judge today and a judge the day after a document of the kind that we have been discussing had finally been ratified by the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1508.0/2">We do not have such final proposals before us today; nor inevitably could we have them. However, we are entitled to assume that what is likely to emerge from the process into which the Irish have put additional force and life is likely to bear substantial similarity in substance to the previous proposals that formed the basis of the discussion in Rome. It is my judgment&mdash;I accept that it is a matter of judgment&mdash;that the proposals raise constitutional implications that it would be right to put to the people of the United Kingdom. I say that as a matter of law, but also as a matter of politics. One of the features of the debate about Europe and our relationship with Europe is the extent to which we&mdash;the people of the United Kingdom&mdash;have become disconnected. One of the ways in which that connection could more effectively be restored is to give people the opportunity to endorse what is a very substantial change.</p>

	<p pid=".1508.1/1">Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman accept that any new treaty will be subject to close parliamentary scrutiny? If we then had a yes-no referendum on whether to endorse it, he&mdash;like me&mdash;would no doubt campaign for a yes vote, if the treaty emerges in the form that seems likely. A yes vote would be a clear endorsement, but what would a no vote mean? We cannot anticipate the result, but it appears that a no vote would be interpreted as giving a mandate for a blank cheque to negotiate further changes to the existing treaty, the Single European Act, the Maastricht treaty and the treaty of accession, and even to reopen the issue of the primacy of European law. If a no vote could be interpreted in that way by those who are demanding a referendum&mdash;notably, the right-wing press&mdash;would not it be a dangerous further step to take after comprehensive parliamentary scrutiny, which has been regarded as adequate on all previous occasions?</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>, we will admit the new member states without any constitutional change, under the existing arrangements enshrined in the treaty of Nice. When the proceedings on the constitution became becalmed, I suspected that all we would have needed was 18 months of trying to live under the arrangements in the Nice treaty and there would have been a clamour for a constitution, because of the sclerosis that would undoubtedly have occurred and the inability of the European Union to operate in the absence of a constitutional document of the kind that we are discussing. I do not seek to reopen any of the previous treaties, but I accept the Foreign Secretary's point that in many respects they are opaque and difficult to understand. It is often difficult to find the details of particular competences, which require substantial searching. The argument in favour of a constitution that sets down clearly the competences&mdash;and the extent to which they are restricted to Brussels or domestic Parliaments&mdash;is essential.</p>

	<p pid=".1509.1/2">In 1995, we had a rare Liberal Democrat Opposition day that resulted in the motion that we had tabled being passed. The motion argued that if there was a material change in the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, such change should be ratified and endorsed by a referendum. Not all those who now argue either for or against a referendum found time to vote on that occasion.

	<p pid=".1510.3/1">No, I want to make progress. I have been generous in giving way, and although I am not subject to the time limit on speeches I do not want to trespass unnecessarily on Back Benchers' time.</p>
	<p pid=".1510.3/2">Those in favour of a constitution for Europe should be prepared to argue their case in order to reconnect the individual electors of this country with the EU. There is a large amount of shadow boxing in these matters. Foreign policy, defence and taxation are red-line issues for the whole House and exchanges designed to suggest that the Government are somehow willing to make concessions on them are artificial. Those matters are the quintessential responsibility of this Parliament; it is notable that they have not been devolved to Wales or to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".1510.3/3">Earlier, I said that the existing treaty system is opaque. It certainly needs clarity and the purpose of the constitution is to set down and define the role and powers of the institutions of the European Union. As I have already said, we will be able to admit the accession states on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>; it is not constitutionally necessary to have the proposed constitution but it is politically essential.</p>
	<p pid=".1510.3/4">As I have said before, we must bring an end to the constant tinkering with the constitutional arrangements of the European Union. We cannot continue to conduct the affairs of the EU as if we were engaged in a perpetual Maoist cultural revolution. When we consider what things have been like under the existing membership, we can imagine how difficult they are likely to be when there are 25 members. That culture has too often been characterised by last-minute compromise, set against a background of physical exhaustion and horse-trading.</p>

	<p pid=".1510.5/1">If only.</p>
	<p pid=".1510.5/2">My support arises from my unabashed enthusiasm for the European Union, which dates back to the 1975 referendum campaign when I shared platforms for the yes campaign with such distinguished parliamentarians as Lord Whitelaw, Brian Walden and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton. The yes campaign was very distinguished&mdash;even aristocratic. I believe firmly that, as the Prime Minister and his predecessor have said, Britain should be at the heart of Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".1510.5/3">As I have said before, I believe that Britain should be a member of the single European currency. I believe in an effective common foreign and security policy, which is what Maastricht envisaged. Indeed, Maastricht went on to envisage the possibility of a common defence&mdash;something that is not much talked about these days, but it most certainly was in the treaty. A constitution of the type proposed will be entirely advantageous not only to Europe but to us, too.</p>
	<p pid=".1510.5/4">The background for that is my overwhelming belief in the need for co-operation with our European partners. Let me take the illustration of international terrorism. Does anyone really believe that we can achieve success in that campaign, unless there is much more co-operation than we have previously experienced? The exchange of intelligence and the movement of individuals and money all require co-operation with our European partners. How would we make environmental advances, unless we do so co-operatively?</p>

	<p pid=".1511.0/1">I am extremely grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for taking an intervention. I have waited patiently for him to address the fundamental rights aspect of the constitution, and it would be enormously helpful to those of us who have some doubts about the wisdom of the European constitution if he would do so. I raise that issue in particular because he mentioned the supremacy of community law at the beginning his speech. Of course he will be aware that five years' work has gone ahead in Northern Ireland to produce a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. Bearing in mind that the provisions on fundamental rights in the constitution will also have supremacy, have we all been going through the razzmatazz in Northern Ireland needlessly on a Bill of Rights?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1511.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/781" speakername="Menzies Campbell" colnum="1511"  time="017:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-31.htm#40330-31_spnew6">
	<p pid=".1511.1/1">I would hesitate to suggest that razzmatazz in Northern Ireland had been needless. The hon. Lady, who is an expert in the field, knows much more about it than I do. Of course the charter of fundamental rights supplements and, in some respects, adds to the European convention on human rights, but the convention is one to which we have always been a signatory. The change that occurred when the Government came to power was to pass legislation that allowed British citizens the right to invoke the provisions of the convention and to seek to vindicate their rights under that convention in British domestic courts, without having to go Strasbourg.</p>
	<p pid=".1511.1/2">The fact that the fundamental rights have now been introduced seems to be one of those constitutional implications to which I have previously referred. The charter introduces something new and not something for which the Government had a mandate, given their manifesto. So my answer to the hon. Lady must be that I do not purport to pass judgment on the position in Northern Ireland, but I most certainly believe that the European convention on human rights and the charter raise, as a consequence of the charter in particular, some fundamental questions of a constitutional nature, hence justifying the argument&mdash;in my view, in part at least&mdash;for a referendum.</p>
	<p pid=".1511.1/3">On a number of occasions, I have talked about the need to reconnect the citizen with the European Union. Hardly a day goes by when we do not open our newspapers to find dire predictions about the number of people who are likely to vote in the next general election to the House, but how many people are likely to vote in the European elections, no matter how vigorous the campaign might be? That will be a measure of the extent to which Europe is not seen as something of significant importance in the lives of many people. That is why I argue that a referendum on the issues with which we are concerned today, allowing the British people the opportunity to pass judgment and to endorse what is proposed, would be entirely in their interests and in ours as well, so I have no doubt that the opportunity offered by a referendum is one that should not be passed up.</p>

	<p pid=".1512.2/1">I take as my opening text the Prime Minister's words when he spoke at the Labour party conference a couple of years ago:</p>
	<p pid=".1512.2/2" class="indent">&quot;We're at our best when at our boldest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1512.2/3">It seems that this is an opportunity for the Government to be bold, to take the risk and the chance to trust the people. We are also currently engaged in an exercise called the big conversation, and we have an opportunity to have a conversation with the British people that will result in a conclusion&mdash;a vote at the end if we go down the road of a referendum. This opportunity should not be missed, because I fear very much that the big conversation is being driven by the ideas of those American political theorists, Simon and Garfunkel, who in their seminal text, &quot;The Boxer&quot;, said:</p>
	<p pid=".1512.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Still a man hears what he wants to hear</p>
	<p pid=".1512.2/5" class="indent">And disregards the rest&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1512.2/6">The only opinions that will be listened to are those that fit what is already acceptable. However, an open-ended decision to hold a referendum and to be bound by the result would galvanise political opinion in Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".1512.2/7">The suggestion that line-by-line political scrutiny by the House would be sufficient misses the point about the disconnection between the political process and the people in the country. Endless hours in which lawyers quibble over details that are fascinating to them is not the same as forcing the British people to make a decision that we, who see ourselves as their political masters in many ways&mdash;regrettably in my view&mdash;would agree to be bound by. That opportunity should not be missed.</p>
	<p pid=".1512.2/8">To those who ask what no means, I would have thought that no in a referendum clearly means that we will not accept what is being offered. Those who suggest that this would be a problem only for Britain are missing the point. A no by any country that is given the opportunity in any way to ratify the constitution and declines to do so means that the constitution has to go into the melting pot. If the Portuguese decide to vote it down, it will not be a problem solely for the Portuguese, and it will not be a solely British problem if we decide to vote it down. It will be a problem for all those who are gathered together to debate how matters should be progressed. We must reject completely the assumption that we cannot have a referendum in case we come out with what the Government would see as the wrong decision that leaves us isolated in Europe. We must recognise that other countries are prepared to trust their peoples. Why are we not prepared to trust ours?</p>

	<p pid=".1513.0/1">Let us follow my hon. Friend's train of thought. If there is a no vote and the Government bring back a new treaty, will there be a second referendum&mdash;and a third and a fourth?</p>

	<p pid=".1513.1/1">That is an interesting point. I remind the Minister of what happened in Ireland when the people had the temerity to turn down a treaty. They were then obliged under international pressure to hold another referendum. If the Government tell us that they are willing to hold a second referendum if the people vote no in the first one and they then make substantial changes to the treaty, I would support them in those circumstances. I would be willing to support a second referendum if the first referendum resulted in rejection of the constitution. The assumption is again being made that we are the only people who might turn the constitution down. If other people reject it and we have a completely new constitution, it seems fair that the people should have the opportunity to make a further decision.</p>

	<p pid=".1513.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman recall that, in the two instances in which there has been a second referendum, the outrageous situation emerged in which the rules were changed in respect of financing, advertising and the rest of it? In the case of the Irish referendum, that occurred on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-24">24 December</phrase> when most good Irishmen were in the pubs.</p>

	<p pid=".1513.3/1">I certainly hope that the Government in this country would have sufficient integrity not to seek to change the rules for a second referendum should we get to that stage. That would be outrageous. We would need to pay attention to how much both sides spent and we would have to consider whether the allegedly impartial information provided by the Electoral Commission and others was, in fact, impartial. None the less, the pattern of the referendum should not then be changed.</p>
	<p pid=".1513.3/2">I want to raise with the Minister the issue of how people will express their views. I want to avoid a situation in which the European elections or the general election are seen as referendums on the European constitution. Issues relating to Europe&mdash;as we know from the Conservative party&mdash;can split parties. A substantial minority of Labour Members favour a referendum and would wish to oppose the constitution as it is currently put forward in such a referendum. People should not have to choose in such a way given that there are two cross-cutting cleavages and we have the opportunity to park the European issue in a referendum so that a decision can be made on it separately from the European or general elections.</p>
	<p pid=".1513.3/3">Lest the Minister be in any doubt about the scale of pubic opinion in his party, I tell him that opinion polls conducted among the major trade unions affiliated to the Labour party show that 81 per cent. of Unison members polled, 78 per cent. of Amicus members, 88 per cent. of Transport and General Workers Union members and 80 per cent. of GMB members favour a referendum. It is clear that those who speak up on the matter are not necessarily in the majority, but as the Minister knows, expressing dissent from the Government's view on anything is not necessarily a career-enhancing move. Several people would prefer to wait until a later stage before expressing their view. All that the minority of Labour Members have is the people, the arguments and the capitalist press, and that combination managed to cause a fair amount of damage on the question of the euro. I notice that those who were on the losing side&mdash;the Government side&mdash;during the euro debate are exactly the same people who are against a referendum and in favour of ramming through the creation of a European superstate.</p>
	<p pid=".1513.3/4">In the debate that we are having tonight, and the one that will go on, I hope that people will not revert to citing the smears and distortions that we often hear from spinmeisters in the Government, especially the accusation that those of us who are against the Government proposal to ram through the measure without a referendum are simply little Englanders. I might be little, but I plead not guilty to the other charge. A number of us are linking up with &quot;Democracy International&quot;, which is a multinational campaign to try to achieve referendums throughout the European Union. I hope that the Government recognise that the argument for referendums on such an important issue is widespread throughout the European Union, and that they appreciate that those of us who argue for referendums in this country and elsewhere in the European Union are doing so in the spirit of internationalism.</p>
	<p pid=".1513.3/5">I also hope that the Government will refrain from arguing that those of us who are in favour of a referendum and against the new constitution are automatically in favour of withdrawing from the European Union. To the best of my knowledge, no Labour Member who argues in favour of a referendum is in favour of withdrawing from the European Union. Repeating that accusation, even though it is repeatedly denied, is a deliberate attempt to distort the terms of the debate. The Minister is not a stupid man. Indeed, he is a bright man and, on occasions, a pleasant man. He has bought me libations on several occasions&mdash;perhaps too seldom to recall them all just now. I hope that he will intervene on his perhaps less fastidious colleagues to ensure that that accusation is not repeated.</p>
	<p pid=".1513.3/6">I have touched on the question of what will happen if the constitution is rejected. That will be a problem not only for us, but for Europe. If the constitution is rejected by several European states, the problem will be much more collective than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
	<p pid=".1513.3/7">I regret the opportunistic way in which what happened in Madrid and elsewhere is advanced as an argument in favour of the accretion of more powers at the centre. How can we possibly trust those in the European Union who are incapable of stopping thieves and vagabonds robbing the common agricultural policy blind to police against terror in the EU? It is clear that before there is any further accretion of powers to the EU, it must put its own house in order. The British Government have made insufficient efforts to reform the way in which the EU operates, to increase the financial probity of the schemes it runs, or to examine the value for money obtained, for example, in foreign aid programmes. Before we give the EU more money to spend, we should ensure that it uses the powers and assets that it has better.</p>
	<p pid=".1513.3/8">We must remember that we in Parliament have power as a result of the votes of the people. The referendum is important. At a time when there is severe dislocation between those who govern and those who are governed, we have an opportunity to give the people a choice. We should do so.</p>

	<p pid=".1515.0/1">The constitution is the most important measure that I have faced in my 20 years as a Member of Parliament, and which the House has faced since this country entered the European Economic Community in 1973. However, the Prime Minister's sole preoccupation is to get it through quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".1515.0/2">I respect those&mdash;we have heard some of them speak in this short debate&mdash;who argue for a highly integrated Europe with a single structure, a new legal order, a permanent President, a Foreign Minister and extensive new powers over immigration, criminal justice and the economies of member states. I do not agree with them, but I can at least debate with them. I have no respect whatever for those who deny the epic importance of what the House is now considering&mdash;who refer to it as &quot;a tidying-up exercise&quot;. The cure for that is simply to read the constitution in its draft form.</p>
	<p pid=".1515.0/3">The draft constitution defines and limits the powers of member states probably better and more extensively than those of the European institutions. It is just as much a written constitution for this country as it is for Europe, and we in this country have not had a written constitution since Cromwell briefly introduced one following the civil war. There is a massive transfer upwards of powers to the new Union. That fact is inescapable&mdash;it is written on almost every page of the draft.</p>
	<p pid=".1515.0/4">We have again debated the primacy clause today, and the Government have again claimed that article 10 simply repeats what is in treaty law. It does not do that. There is nothing in existing European treaties about the primacy of the European Court of Justice or of those treaties over national laws. It is a convention that has been established in the case law of the European Court of Justice that where directives and regulations conflict with national laws, those directives and regulations shall prevail, but on those foundations the draft constitution erects an unqualified assertion of the primacy of the constitution and all the laws flowing from it over the laws of member states.</p>

	<p pid=".1516.0/1">If, as the right hon. Gentleman says, the draft is some sort of integrationist plot, will he tell me why the Conservative party is happy for there to be a President of the European Commission and a President of the European Parliament, yet, in terms of the Heads of Government, unhappy for there to be a President of the Council?</p>

	<p pid=".1516.1/1">Oh yes, we are creating a Europe of presidents all right. I can add to that. There will be a president of the European Court of Justice, a president of the European Central Bank, a permanent President of the Council, a President of the Commission and a President of the European Parliament. It is a presidents' plot, if it is a plot at all. It is not a people's Europe that we are developing&mdash;it is a politicians Europe with jobs for more politicians. If that is the Europe that the hon. Gentleman wants, he has it in the draft.</p>
	<p pid=".1516.1/2">The point that I was making, which has not been contradicted from those on the Government Front Bench, is that the primacy clause, article 10, will extend far further than anything in the existing treaties. It will implement the same primacy over the intergovernmental pillars&mdash;that is, justice and home affairs, and the common foreign and security policy&mdash;for the first time. It is not just the laws of the new Union that will have primacy, but the constitution itself&mdash;that is, the obligations in the constitution&mdash;the solidarity obligation on member states and the entire EU charter of fundamental rights. That takes up the whole of part II of the constitution. The charter of fundamental rights&mdash;all of it&mdash;will therefore have primacy over the laws of member states.</p>
	<p pid=".1516.1/3">In his remarks, the Foreign Secretary claimed that there was a House of Lords report that showed that there is a shift from the Commission to member states. It would have been less disingenuous of him if he had not told us that that report came out long before the end of the Convention&mdash;before the Convention even defined or debated the powers of the Commission. So if anyone is peddling myths in this debate, it is the Foreign Secretary.</p>
	<p pid=".1516.1/4">It has been asserted that the constitution will be simpler than the treaties. It is, in fact, longer than the treaties that it replaces. It has been claimed that it will bring clarity to the division of power between member states and the new Union, but most policy areas will be shared. There is no other constitution in the world that defines all the policies to be shared. What is the definition of sharing? When the Union legislates, member states will have to leave that area of policy entirely to the new Union. I hope that none of us have to share a flat with someone whose definition of sharing is that when they move into the flat, we have to move out. That is the definition written in the draft constitution and it is not under review. It is not a red line issue for the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1516.1/5">Criminal justice, perhaps, gives us the best overall example of what is at stake. There are 21 completely new articles covering justice and home affairs in the draft constitution. They cover the definition of serious crimes and the penalties that will attach to them in general areas such as corruption, computer crime and organised crime. All that will be harmonised and decided by the Union by majority voting. The same is true of criminal procedures, rules of evidence and the rights of the accused. All these things will be decided by majority voting.</p>
	<p pid=".1516.1/6">The Minister for Europe tabled an amendment in the Convention disagreeing with that in unequivocal terms. I give him credit for that, at least. He said that it is essential that the relevant article is rejected in its present form and made subject to unanimity if it survives. Why, then, do the Government now say that they have so-called wriggle room in respect of the criminal justice procedures? Those go to the heart of what the House is about. We have just had a Criminal Justice Bill going through the House that attempted to define and, in some cases, limit court proceedings and the rights of the accused. It is the essence of democracy that such matters are debated here where we are answerable to our constituents and ultimately to an electorate. All that goes upwards to the new Union.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1517.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/951" speakername="David Heathcoat-Amory" colnum="1517"  time="018:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-33.htm#40330-33_spnew1">
	<p pid=".1517.1/1">With his ingenious Bill, which I have signed, my hon. Friend would go a long way towards establishing a bulwark against the new constitution. I wish him well with that, but it forms no part of the Government's case in the forthcoming negotiation. The irony is that the entire exercise was supposed to be not about writing a new constitution&mdash;that is alluded to only at the end of the instructions given to the convention&mdash;but about bringing democracy to Europe. That means bringing Europe closer to its citizens. That was the instruction given to us. How does it bring Europe closer to the citizen to take more decisions away from member states, away from the people and upwards to the most remote tier of Government of all in Europe? That is why this is in essence a democratic issue.</p>
	<p pid=".1517.1/2">In my view, this is not only wrong, it is dangerous. It breeds alienation and despair, and ultimately extremism, if decisions that should be taken here about the coercive power of the state, about imprisoning people, about our foreign policy and about the conduct of our economic and employment policies, are taken away from the Chamber, which is answerable to an identified electorate, and given to a Union that is beyond any sort of democratic control.</p>
	<p pid=".1517.1/3">There is only one solution and that is to ask the people. I entirely agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/843" name="Ian Davidson">the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson)</phrase> that that is not merely an option, it is essential. The Government have no mandate for this European constitution. I have a copy of the relevant part of the Labour party's manifesto on which it stood at the last election. There is nothing whatever in it about a European constitution. That differs from the Maastricht treaty, which featured prominently in the Conservative manifesto of 1992. In any event, we shall have a referendum about Maastricht when and if the Government make up their mind about the big issue of Maastricht, which is the European currency, the euro. As I have said, there is nothing in the manifesto, on which the Labour party won the last election, about a new European constitution. That is why we need to ask the people.</p>
	<p pid=".1517.1/4">If the Government are right, and conceivably they could persuade the people that this is only a modest consolidating measure of no great consequence compared with weighty issues&mdash;such as whether Hartlepool should have a mayor, or whether Sedgefield, I think that that is the next one, will decide whether it will have a mayor&mdash;let them have the confidence to advance that argument and win that argument. That is, if they really can persuade the people that this European constitution is of no great importance. I will put my case, and that of my right hon. and hon. Friends, to the arbitration of the British people.</p>
	<p pid=".1517.1/5">Let us remind ourselves that the opening words of this constitution are about reflecting the will of the citizens and states of Europe. How do the Government know that it reflects the will of the citizens of Europe without asking them? It would be an outrage if the Government were to bounce this issue through a supine House of Commons in which they have a temporary majority and take us into a binding written constitution for the first time in our history without asking the people for their consent. That is why federalists and those who want an integrated Europe joined forces with us in a common endeavour to ask the people, to trust the people, and to get a vote on the issue this year.</p>

	<p pid=".1518.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/951" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase>. I listened with great care to what he said. He confused a series of concepts. The idea of having a referendum for a mayor is a local issue and entirely separate from a national issue as to whether there should be a referendum on joining a European constitution. In the United States they have many referendums on, for example, whether people want a supermarket. That is not the same as a national referendum on a national issue, which would lie within the heart of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1518.0/2">One of the earliest stories that I learned many years ago was that a senior figure, Lloyd George, brought in a younger man called Harold Macmillan. Harold Macmillan asked him what was the essence of a good speech. Lloyd George said that it was to choose one's themes and to stay with them. I will do that in the time that is available to me.</p>
	<p pid=".1518.0/3">My first theme is that of ever-closer union. The right hon. Member for Wells referred to the people, the citizens of the European Union. The citizens of the European Union benefit from free trade and the single market because the Single European Act was signed in 1986 under Lady Thatcher's leadership. They benefit from the sense of security, because the continent was ravaged by wars for 1,000 years.</p>

	<p pid=".1519.1/1">I will come to NATO in a moment, and it is part of my theme&mdash;I am always grateful for sedentary interventions by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/893" name="Eric Forth">the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1519.1/2">We will discuss the global war on terrorism, but EU citizens have those two major benefits, which bring the citizens of Europe closer to the concept of the European Union. The concept of the ever-closer union was adopted by Sir Edward Heath way back in 1972, when we signed up to it for the first time. We moved closer when we signed the Single European Act; we moved closer still when we signed the Maastricht treaty; and we will go closer again when the European Union moves eastwards and grows to 25 states&mdash;as my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said, it may grow to 27 states. That is the ever-closer union that we are debating tonight.</p>
	<p pid=".1519.1/3">In this debate, I have been struck by how the House of Commons has suddenly become a Chamber for barristers. Perhaps that is because the Foreign Secretary and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/697" name="Michael Ancram">the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase> are barristers.</p>

	<p pid=".1519.3/1">I shall make my confession in a moment. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/781" name="Menzies Campbell">The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase> is a QC, and I must humbly admit that I, too, am a barrister. However, I will not dwell on the legality of the debate. We have examined clauses, interstices in Lords reports, article 12 and article 13A&mdash;I almost stood up and asked what article 15 says in the hope that someone would give me an answer. The debate is not about the pernickety points of the various articles in such a huge constitutional document; it is about the principle of ever-closer union and whether it should be put to the test of a referendum.</p>
	<p pid=".1519.3/2">When I listened to the right hon. Member for Wells I was struck by the reversal of Conservative policy. Over the past century, Conservative party policy was to win an election, govern the country and, after four to five years, to return to the country, render an account and seek a further mandate. What has happened to that principle? The only time that principle slipped was on the Maastricht treaty, when, in order to keep the Tory party together, the Prime Minister at the time offered a referendum on the single currency. The only time that a Conservative Government have ever offered a referendum was on joining the single currency, and the only reason for that was to keep the Conservative party together.</p>
	<p pid=".1519.3/3">I shall make another confession, since I have made one already: in opposition, I would never have agreed to a Labour Government having a referendum on a single currency. I take the single currency not as a constitutional matter, not as a matter of profound significance to our country, but simply as completing the architecture of the single market, which Lady Thatcher introduced in 1986.</p>

	<p pid=".1520.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that we are watching an Opposition tactic? Because they cannot win votes in the House, they are trying to persuade the wider public, with the help of certain friends in the media, in order to obtain a no result. Hon. Members such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/951" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon.

	<p pid=".1520.1/2">On opposition for opposition's sake, I sympathise with the Opposition because day in, day out we sat through the debates on the Maastricht treaty. I remember coming into this Chamber in daylight and going out next morning in daylight, never having seen the evening.</p>

	<p pid=".1520.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing me to my third theme&mdash;leadership. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister for Europe is in his place, because with his French background he, too, will remember Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin. He is nodding, of course, because he has read his history books. In 1848, that gentleman was the leader of a faction that stormed the National Assembly. Afterwards, he was found at the very back of the crowd, and someone said, &quot;What are you doing? You're their leader.&quot; He replied, &quot;Yes, I am their leader. That's why I'm here at the back&mdash;I'm following them.&quot; We saw from the leadership of the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes that he was following the crowd behind him. That is in the interests of neither the Conservative party nor the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1520.3/2">My fourth theme is NATO, which the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst mentioned from a sedentary position. A significant event took place yesterday, when seven new nations from the east joined NATO and added to the sense of security to which my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary referred. NATO is responsible for our territorial defence; it is equally responsible for those other countries and for the European Union as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".1520.3/3">So, as Europe moves into this new century, we have the security of NATO, ever-closer union, the free market, and stability and prosperity the likes of which have never been seen before. We have to decide whether we will do our constitutional duty by debating this ever-closer union in this Chamber, taking into account the views of our new-found barrack-room lawyer friends on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1520.3/4">I am glad that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/843" name="Ian Davidson">the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson)</phrase> is still in his place, because he and I have debated many issues. Sometimes we are on the same side of the fence, as on first past the post as opposed to proportional representation, but we found ourselves on different sides on the single currency. I should like to refute a comment that he made earlier. Those who support the single currency have not lost any battle. We regret the fact that a referendum did not take place early in 1997, but it will take place eventually when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has set down the most rigorous conditions for entry and has twice said that we have not met them, agrees that that has happened. The battle is not lost: my hon. Friend and I will meet again on this economic battlefield.</p>

	<p pid=".1521.0/1">It is important that we have a referendum on the single currency. I wish that we had already done so, because the people would have had their say, almost certainly to vote no overwhelmingly. The hon. Gentleman says that this constitutional issue should be debated in this Chamber. That is true, but why not debate it in the country as well? Why does he not trust the people to debate the very serious issue of how we are to be governed in future and let them have a say in a referendum?</p>

	<p pid=".1521.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I respond by saying that the day must come when the bridge between civil society and political society is cleared of the distortions of the media; then we can have a proper, genuine debate on a whole host of issues. We know full well that those debates cannot be held on equal or neutral terrain.</p>
	<p pid=".1521.1/2">Let me make another point to those who claim that a referendum is in the interest of this country. In 1969, when General de Gaulle held a referendum on regional assemblies and reform of the Senate, it was converted into a debate about whether people wanted him to stay in power. It is therefore not sensible to hold a mid-term referendum on such an important issue. I make a distinction between local referendums, which the right hon. Member for Wells mentioned, and a national matter, which falls back to the Chamber. We are elected; we have a mandate. The people&mdash;our constituents&mdash;expect us to do their work for them and make a decision in the interests of our country.</p>

	<p pid=".1521.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. The Foreign Secretary made it clear that the treaty is a constitutional treaty, which will be fully debated. The debate will be long and we may spend many a night rather than many a day here. However, the House is the place in which to hold the debate. We can have knowledge, information and a free flow of ideas, and ultimately the House will decide. At the next election, the country will follow that decision.</p>

	<p pid=".1522.0/1">Many Labour supporters, especially old Labour supporters, must be distressed to find that, when the glorious day in 1997 was repeated at the subsequent election, they elected a Bourbon Government. &quot;L'&eacute;tat c'est moi&quot;&mdash;what I say must go; I do not want to hear the views of others.</p>
	<p pid=".1522.0/2">The struggle has been long. It was almost inconceivable in 1970 that we were on the threshold of constructing a new system of government that grants rights beyond the call of the British people. That is what we are considering&mdash;who is sovereign. The Labour party struggled to expand the vote because it knew that, through gaining seats and a majority here, it could establish what the law is and shall be. It could set wrongs right and look backwards and forwards. That glorious struggle formed part of our modern constitution. Today, we hear arguments that all that counts for nothing and that the House is sovereign.</p>
	<p pid=".1522.0/3">I believe, however, that our modern constitution was declared at the turn of the last century by the new Labour party of the day. It declared that the people were sovereign and that the House was the means whereby that sovereignty was expressed. We send elected representatives here&mdash;they are here today and gone tomorrow. We may change them and by changing them, we change our law: the law that can send us to prison and the law that can make us free. Through that law and this institution, we protect and preserve our liberty. This place is about that essential trust.</p>
	<p pid=".1522.0/4">Yet the Government say that they can redesign the constitution because they understand its essential vulnerability. It is not entrenched and no constitutional court secures it. That is why we have witnessed the mashing of the conventions that made our constitution work. The brave, new, Bourbon Labour Government say that they will sweep away the principle that no Parliament may bind its successor. In the past 30 years, the people of Britain have understood but a glimmer of that. The process of European integration and the new judicial and legal system have never received the direct attestation and consent of the people who sent us here. That is the heart of the matter. The sovereignty of Parliament is the sovereignty of the people. And when Labour Members are asked by their constituents, &quot;Why don't you change the law to prevent the export of live horse meat to the continent?&quot;, the brave new Bourbon Labour Government say, &quot;Oh no, it's not for us. We've given that power away.&quot; By what authority have they done so? By the transient authority of a temporary Government that in time will give way to another Government, which in time will give way to another Government.</p>
	<p pid=".1522.0/5">The continuing constitutional necessity of this country is to ensure that the people are sovereign. The denial of the proposition that the people may make a judgment on any of the Acts that have removed power from their Government and the jurisdiction of their courts is wholly to be opposed. We will fight, and there are millions out there who are no longer prepared to tolerate the nonsense that goes on under the protestations of these Bourbons, who say, &quot;It is a matter for us, but once we have cast our view, we want it to be immutable.&quot; Nothing in this world is immutable.</p>

This dire Government are satisfied at best with acquiescence and never go for consent.</p>
	<p pid=".1523.3/3">The expression of consent on this measure, as has been pointed out by the Liberal Democrats, does much more for the body politic than this stonewalling.

	<p pid=".1523.4/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>, the whole House will celebrate the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 member states, a process ratified unanimously in this place. This enlargement process, however, could have been achieved by a simple accession treaty, which everybody in the House would have supported. Instead, this wonderful historic moment on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase> will be overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the proposed constitution, with all its attendant baggage, which has nothing whatever to do with the enlargement, as the Prime Minister has in effect conceded.</p>
	<p pid=".1523.4/2">The Laeken summit called for the simplification of EU treaties, for more openness and transparency, and for an attempt to reconnect the peoples of Europe with EU institutions. At the time, stirring speeches identifying the need to address the democratic deficit were made by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the then Minister for Europe. Yet&mdash;here I echo the words of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/951" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase>&mdash;no one in their wildest imaginings would believe that simplification, openness, transparency and reconnection characterised the constitutional package that is likely to be agreed in 12 weeks' time; quite the reverse.</p>
	<p pid=".1523.4/3">This constitution was idiotically described by the former Europe Minister as a tidying-up exercise, and even more absurdly described as a constitution no more important than a golf club's, which would fit into a jacket pocket. Those were the words of the Foreign Secretary. In fact, the constitution is riven with contradiction and ambiguity&mdash;a veritable beanfeast for lawyers. In no way does it give the people of Europe any more control over EU institutions, or any enhanced level of accountability.</p>
	<p pid=".1523.4/4">Tellingly, most of the constitution was opposed at different stages by the British Government, but then meekly accepted. Virtually nothing in the constitutional package bears the stamp of British influence; but what is most shameful is&mdash;once again&mdash;the truly terrible lack of leadership by Britain in the European Union. Britain has always been carried along in the slipstream of others, always&mdash;in this respect&mdash;wrongly and pathetically trying to secure influence by giving in on the constitution itself, the charter of fundamental rights, the single legal entity, the new Foreign Minister and the diplomatic service.</p>
	<p pid=".1523.4/5">What is the result? Ten years ago, 72 per cent. of EU citizens saw their country's membership as a good thing. Today, less than half of them do. In Britain, only 29 per cent. do. The dangerous disillusionment grows, and by no stretch of the imagination will this constitution deal with it.</p>
	<p pid=".1523.4/6">The key question is simply this: why do we need a constitution? It is a question that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> and I have posed both in the House and to so many of our European partners, but we have never received a satisfactory answer. The constitution has nothing to do with enlargement, it does not increase accessibility, and its hundreds of pages are the reverse of simplicity.</p>
	<p pid=".1523.4/7">The Foreign Secretary knows perfectly well that there is no real and universal enthusiasm for this constitution. The technical elements for enlargement were agreed at Nice. Everyone agrees that, in essence, that could be enough. Everyone knows that the gulf between the elites of Europe and the people is growing, and that turnouts will no doubt be down again in the European elections. So why do the Government not speak out against a constitution to which they were originally opposed? It is like the emperor's new clothes. If the Government could just once in our relationship with the EU&mdash;even at this stage&mdash;say no, others would be only too pleased to agree.</p>
	<p pid=".1523.4/8">Why do the Government not do that? They lack the principled courage that would enable them to do it. That is entirely characteristic of a Government whose failure to show leadership ill serves the British people, and who have not managed to secure the return of a single power either to this Parliament or to the people of this country since they came to office.</p>

	<p pid=".1525.1/1">I entirely agree. That is at the heart of the Government's attitude to the British people on this key matter.</p>
	<p pid=".1525.1/2">Let me say this to the Minister. As we have seen in other countries, influence in the EU arises because member states pursue and protect their national interests vigorously and with determination. This constitution could have been strangled at birth if the British Government had insisted.</p>
	<p pid=".1525.1/3">The devil is in the detail. We know from the ambiguity that surrounds the text that the unwelcome EU jurisprudence will spread in our national life. We need only read the House of Lords European Union Committee report on the future role of the European Court of Justice to see that. It envisages a considerable extension of the powers of the European Court of Justice, which will become the new constitutional court and the new supreme court for the Union. It is the self-same European Court that has repeatedly forced forward an integrationist agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".1525.3/1">Exactly, a shared competence is one that has evolved from the European Union. It was notable in an earlier debate that the Foreign Secretary did not even know the definition of a shared competence. It is typical of Ministers to diminish themselves in the eyes of their European counterparts by interpreting EU decisions here in a way that would be laughed out of court everywhere else.</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/2">The truth of the matter is that six EU countries will be having referendums&mdash; and quite possibly the Czech Republic and Poland, too. Others may follow. I challenge the Government to let us have a proper, open and transparent debate and to let the nation hear us argue our corners. The way to achieve that is through a referendum campaign. I entirely agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/843" name="Ian Davidson">the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson)</phrase>, who said that being in favour of a referendum does not mean being in favour of withdrawal. The Government's suggestion that it does is entirely incorrect.</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/3">When the Foreign Secretary was Home Secretary in 1998, he spoke about an electoral system for elections to Westminster. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Confidence in our political system has been significantly eroded in recent years. Our challenge is to restore confidence in our democracy, to bring decision-making closer to those who are affected by decisions, and to restore trust in the way in which we are governed. That is why we have embarked on a major programme of change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/5">He also said:</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Voters, not politicians, should have the final say . . . Whether there is change or no change, the referendum will provide the popular legitimacy that is essential for our working democracy. It is the British people's right to have that say, and our responsibility to provide it.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1998-06-02.190"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 June 1998; Vol. 313, c. 190&ndash;01</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/7">That was what our Foreign Secretary said in this Chamber when he was Home Secretary in 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/8">Some will be in favour of the constitutional package before us, and I respect their democratic right of opinion, but we take a different view. What unites so many across the party political divide is a clear recognition that this is of constitutional significance. If the good burghers of Hartlepool are allowed a referendum, so should be the voters of the United Kingdom. In that regard, it might be of interest to hear what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1092" name="Peter Mandelson">the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson)</phrase> said in a speech in Berlin in March 1998:</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/9" class="indent">&quot;It may be that the era of pure representative democracy is coming slowly to an end. Today, people want to be more involved. Tony Blair's Government has already held two referendums and three more are at some stage in prospect, not to mention more citizens' movements . . . Democracy and legitimacy need constant renewal. They need to be redefined with each generation . . . This requires a different style of politics&quot;;</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/10">and he went on to talk about the necessity of involvement via the internet and referendums. He continued:</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/11" class="indent">&quot;People have no time for a style of government that talks down to them and takes them for granted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/12">I could not have put it better myself.</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/13">The Government have sponsored dozens of referendums to legitimise change since 1997, but when we are confronted with the first written constitution in our history, suddenly every excuse is offered. Interestingly enough, Nigel Smith, who successfully led the yes campaign for Scottish devolution, recently described the same issue as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/14" class="indent">&quot;Consciously or unconsciously, through the use of referendums Tony Blair has completely changed the constitutional landscape in this country. Up until this point, whenever it has contemplated a constitutional change&mdash;nationally, regionally or even locally&mdash;this Government has rightly sought the specific endorsement of the people affected in a referendum. It is therefore deeply worrying to observe the inconsistency with which Ministers have approached the question of the proposed EU Constitution. This has naturally changed the expectations of the voters.</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/15" class="indent">For those of us who believe in referendums, the draft Constitution&mdash;whenever it comes&mdash;presents a classic case for initiating a national debate, followed by a binding vote for the people, all the people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1525.3/16">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1220" name="Richard Shepherd">the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd)</phrase> talked about the sovereignty of Parliament and of the people of this country; such sovereignty is at the heart of the democratic process. To deny that this step is of constitutional significance is entirely wrong, and simply widens the gulf that exists between the people of this country and government. Frankly, what is good enough for the people of Ireland, Portugal, the Netherlands and many other countries is certainly good enough for us. Our people are becoming increasingly alienated from the political process and we cannot afford to alienate them further. I invite the Government to think again and to do what is absolutely right: to give the people of this country a choice on a vital matter that affects our future.</p>

	<p pid=".1527.0/1">We have had an enjoyable debate, even if some of it has consisted of a re-run of speeches that we have heard for some time. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/781" name="Menzies Campbell">The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase> said that Ministers should make the case for Europe. I try to do my modest best&mdash;probably not with sufficient success&mdash;but I wish that he, too, would occasionally make the case for Europe, instead of constantly making the <i>Daily Mail</i> case for a referendum. Yet again&mdash;I address my remarks specifically to him&mdash;we have had an essay on form, not substance. I want to talk about the important issues that Europe faces, and the important need to secure a constitutional treaty that brings together the elements of the existing constitution.</p>
	<p pid=".1527.0/2">Of course, we do indeed already have a constitution for Europe. It can be found in the existing treaties, and it talks about ever-closer union&mdash;a phrase that will be removed under the proposed draft.</p>
	<p pid=".1527.0/3">In my view, that constitution gives excessive power to the President of the Commission. The proposed draft will counterbalance that power with a new authority for the nation states of Europe, which are united through their Council of Ministers and their new standing chairman. My one small contribution to British diplomatic parlance was to persuade my Foreign Office colleagues to start describing that gentleman as the &quot;standing chair&quot; of the Council. In some other European languages, the word is the same as &quot;President&quot;; however, that term clarifies the situation.</p>

	<p pid=".1528.8/2">The right hon. Member for Wells made his traditional passionate attack on Europe, but I have to put myself at times in the place of citizens elsewhere in the world. The notion that somehow the French and German constitutions would be abolished by this new European superstate simply is not an argument that can be advanced. Poland and Hungary believe that their sovereignty has been enhanced by joining the EU, even if the right hon. Member for Wells went and campaigned in Poland to stop the Poles from voting yes to joining Europe. The right hon. Gentleman was honest. He was not arguing for a referendum as a point of principle about how we would consult the British people. He wants a referendum campaign to say no. Other hon.

I thought that the definition of a Bourbon king was not &quot;L'&eacute;tat c'est moi&quot;&mdash;that was a bit ahead of their time&mdash;but those who had learned nothing and forgotten nothing. I gently put to the hon. Gentleman as a passionate parliamentarian that that is very much the position of his Front-Bench team today. My party took the same point of view almost exactly 20 years ago. We have learned from that experience. I gently suggest that if the Conservative party wants to be taken seriously as a party of government, it too has to start learning the truth that it would be a disaster for the British people to continue this ranting against membership of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid=".1529.1/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has allowed me to make a slight diversion from my speech and refer to the conclusions of the excellent House of Lords European Union Committee, which have just been published. In paragraph 157 it says:</p>
	<p pid=".1529.1/2" class="indent">&quot;We welcome the fact that Article I-10(1) makes clear that primacy only applies to the Constitution and to Union law that has been adopted in the exercise of competences assigned to the Union's institutions.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1529.4/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The Minister&mdash;inadvertently, I am sure&mdash;is misleading the House. He quoted paragraph 157 of the report. It clearly goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid=".1529.4/2" class="indent">&quot;There remains some uncertainty as to the scope of application of the principle.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1530.1/1">I am happy to take another intervention from the hon. Gentleman, but paragraph 161 says:</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The draft Treaty reaffirms and strengthens the position of the national courts&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/3">We could have a debate about what is in the constitutional treaty. I argue that the authority of the national institutions of Europe&mdash;those that the people of Poland and the Czech Republic have so bravely won in recent years&mdash;is upheld under the terms of this draft treaty. But we are not allowed to have that discussion. Instead we are having a discussion about whether to have a referendum.</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/4">I am a defender of the House of Commons. I was elected 10 years ago and I love this place. It has been good to me and I cannot think of any greater honour for any citizen of this country, especially one such as me, whose parents did not come from here, than to sit in the House of Commons. Therefore, it is extraordinary to me that it is proposed that this House should tonight casually throw away its supreme duty to be the guardian of the interests of the British people and surrender itself to the populist plebiscites of the Rothermere press.</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/5">The Liberal Democrats' position is even odder. I can understand why the Conservatives, with their obsessive dislike of Europe, want to command headlines in the anti-European press. But I do not understand why the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Nationalists and the Ulster Unionists also wish to join the tribe of monkeys on the organs of the Rothermere press. Let us not forget that the Liberal Democrat party is composed of two halves. We know where the Liberals came from, but the other half was a breakaway from the Labour party on the exact issue of the incessant clamour for a referendum to take us out of Europe in the early 1980s. I know from conversations with Liberal Democrat MEPs and Members in the other place that they are distressed that the party has given new lustre to the opportunism of the main Opposition party in supporting this incessant clamour for a plebiscite.</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/6">I am a great fan of Edmund Burke, who argued that Britain should be governed by people with &quot;long views&quot;. When the Conservative party was led by Churchill, Macmillan and Margaret Thatcher&mdash;in her early days&mdash;there were times when it took the long view that it was in Britain's vital interest to be in Europe and to help to run Europe. Today, the Conservatives' idea of Burke's long view is anything that fits into a <i>Daily Mail</i> headline.</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/7">Burke also liked Parliament because it was where we, the elected representatives, could express our views freely</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/8" class="indent">&quot;even though against a predominant and fashionable opinion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/9">I know that the predominant and fashionable opinion in London in much of the press is hostile to Europe. I am happy to nail my colours to this Dispatch Box and say that I am passionately pro-European, and I invite all hon. Members who believe that our country's interests can never lie in adopting the isolationist policies of the Opposition to vote against the motion this evening.</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/10">I also agree with Bagehot when he wrote that</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/11" class="indent">&quot;the distinguishing quality of Parliamentary government is, that in each stage of a public transaction there is discussion: that the public assists at this discussion; that it can, through Parliament, turn out an administration which is not doing as it likes, and can put in an administration which will do as it likes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/12">I invite the Opposition to remain anti-European, to continue to speak against active and involved membership of the European Union and to deny the necessity for making the Union of 25 work by supporting a new rule book in this new constitutional treaty, which will take us forward. The longer the Conservatives remain anti-European, the longer they will stay in opposition.</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/13">Over the years, this nation has signed solemn treaties such as the ones joining the World Trade Organisation, which removed powers from this House over commerce, and NATO, which removed powers from this House over defence policy. We have shared sovereignty to grow and add value to what we do. The European Union is part of that process.</p>
	<p pid=".1530.1/14">I invite the House tonight to uphold parliamentary democracy. I invite the House to say yes to Europe. I invite the House to reject the anti-European and anti-parliamentary nonsense of the Conservative party.</p>

	<p pid=".1540.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That this House insists in its disagreement to Lords amendment 1F to Commons amendment 1C, but proposes an amendment in lieu thereof.</p>
	<p pid=".1540.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">The House of Commons continues to believe that four regions must be included in the Bill, and that these regions should be the north-east, the east midlands, Yorkshire and the north-west. Earlier this afternoon, the House of Lords voted by a narrow margin to yet again prevent convenient all-postal voting in the north-west of England. Their Lordships voted by only 136 to 130 votes to drop the north-west from the proposals put by the Government and the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid=".1540.2/3">It is worth noting that the majority of Cross-Bench peers voting this afternoon voted with the Government against the peculiar alliance between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. Interestingly, there is a majority among life peers in favour of keeping the north-west in a list of four regions. The Government were defeated on that occasion by the votes of the hereditary peers.</p>
	<p pid=".1540.2/4">Let us not forget that the House of Commons has voted for four regions on four separate occasions already&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-16">16 March</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-24">24 March</phrase> and yesterday, <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-29">29 March</phrase>.

	<p pid=".1540.3/1">The Minister continues to speak of the House of Commons, without recognising the fact that he is speaking about only his own party. As I have pointed out to him, independent commentators have said that important matters concerning elections, such as this, should be agreed between the parties. The Government should not involve the other place in a battle when there is no all-party consensus on what they are trying to ram through.</p>

	<p pid=".1540.4/1">The hon. Gentleman clearly has a different understanding of our democracy if he thinks that we should have unanimity among all parties on all matters. The House of Commons makes its decisions on the basis of the majority of votes. We are accountable to our constituents for the decisions that we make, as the hon. Gentleman knows. The House of Lords has powers to revise and amend, which it often uses with authority and experience. On the Bill, we have listened to many of the Lords' concerns. We have conceded, for example, on the declaration of identity, which some of my hon. Friends will remember. We have allowed that provision to be in the Bill, so it is not the case that we have been unwilling to listen or to revise the Bill. The time has come for the House of Commons to make sure that it can assert its view, and we have decided to ensure that all four regions have the opportunity of all-postal voting in June.</p>

	<p pid=".1541.0/1">Is it not peculiar that the Conservative party is enunciating a new doctrine, whereby the will of the House of Commons should not prevail if only the government party emphasises that will? In view of the fact that the Conservative party railroaded the Single European Act through on a guillotine and the poll tax through with only its support, when did that new constitutional doctrine arise? The Conservative spokesman who advocates the new doctrine may want to go to the House of Lords pretty soon himself.</p>

	<p pid=".1541.1/1">It would be somewhat cruel to exacerbate the Conservative spokesman's difficulties on the latter point, but it is odd that the Conservative party has scraped the barrel to the extent that it is resorting to requesting unanimity on such issues. The Conservative spokesman feels that that is the way to proceed, but the majority of elected hon. Members in this House disagree with him, and quite right too.</p>

	<p pid=".1541.2/1">In a previous debate in which the democratic House was attempting to have a democratic say on how we run our democracy, I asked my hon. Friend the Minister to speculate on why both main Opposition parties seem hellbent on making it as inconvenient as possible to vote. Has he had a chance during the intervening period to speculate further on why we are experiencing such resistance from those who may be afraid of high turnouts?</p>

	<p pid=".1541.3/1">The fear of high turnouts may well be a reason for the resistance. The alliance between the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats is peculiar. The phrase &quot;liberal democracy&quot; rings hollow when one thinks that the Liberal Democrats are happy to use and abuse the powers of the other place. Although the Liberal Democrat party is a minority party in this House, it wants to abuse the majority power in the other place to thwart the view of the democratically elected majority in this place.</p>

	<p pid=".1541.4/1">If one examines the Chamber this evening, the majority of Labour Members represent constituencies in the north-west, whereas few, if any, Opposition Members who represent constituencies in the north-west are present.

	<p pid=".1541.5/2">Today, the exchanges between both Houses have matched the current record for disagreements, and if peers in the other place were to resist the fifth decision by the Commons, they would overturn the will of the elected House in a completely unprecedented way, taking our constitution into uncharted waters in a manner not seen since detailed records began after the second world war.

	<p pid=".1542.0/1">The Minister says that 130 peers supported the Government in the vote in the House of Lords. Can he tell me how many Labour peers and how many Cross-Bench peers are in the House of Lords? If this is uncharted constitutional territory, the least the Labour Whips in the Lords could do is get their troops out.</p>

	<p pid=".1542.1/1">An awful lot of Conservative peers did not vote in the Division in the other place. It is interesting that the vote is becoming closer and closer as they realise that their argument for overturning this House of Commons becomes weaker and weaker. The time has now come for the other place and Opposition Members to recognise that they have tested the boundaries of revision and amendment to their limits. Their activities are becoming obstructive and vexatious. I hope that the House will now recognise that the issues are immensely simple. This is a matter of judgment as to which regions we pick to pilot all-postal voting in the June elections. We feel, and this House of Commons believes, that four regions are best.</p>

	<p pid=".1542.2/1">May I make a suggestion to the Minister that is genuinely intended to be helpful? Vote stealing is a very serious offence from which we in Northern Ireland have suffered for generations. To their credit, this Government introduced the Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, a wonderful piece of legislation that was taken through, to the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland, by the Minister for Work, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/758" name="Des Browne">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne)</phrase>. That Act included specific identifiers to eradicate fraud in relation to postal voting. Will the Minister take it away&mdash;I will give him my copy&mdash;to see whether he can engage in some joined-up thinking with the Northern Ireland Office to reassure those of us who are genuinely concerned about postal voting giving rise to fraud that the identifiers that were used so successfully in Northern Ireland could be used in the north of England?</p>

	<p pid=".1542.3/1">The hon. Lady makes a constructive offer: I will certainly take her copy from her after the debate. We have already made several changes to the Bill to improve our ability to counter fraud and malpractice. Our amendment not only reasserts that four regions are best, but helps to bolster still further the anti-fraud measures in the Bill by specifying that the declaration of identity accompanying the ballot paper must advise the voter that the ballot paper should be completed outside the presence of any other person, or, in the case of voters who require assistance&mdash;for example, those with visual impairment&mdash;only in accordance with the advice that we will provide to returning officers. Yet again, the amendment improves anti-fraud measures. It underlines our determination to combat malpractice, reiterates our belief in the secrecy of the private act of casting a vote, and supplements the myriad anti-fraud measures that we have already put in place.</p>

	<p pid=".1543.0/1">This has nothing to do with fraud, as we have been given no evidence whatsoever that fraud will increase as a result of postal voting, nor any details of prosecutions arising from the alleged fraud that we are told about. Does my hon. Friend agree that this is more to do with saving the skins of Liverpool Liberal Democrat councillors than the democratic process?</p>

	<p pid=".1543.1/1">I cannot fathom why the Opposition parties have joined together in this strange way&mdash;we can only speculate on their motives. I now feel very strongly that all-postal voting is no more prone to fraudulence than conventional voting. We have been given no evidence for that&mdash;for example, a record of more convictions having occurred under all-postal voting in the pilots that have taken place than occurred under the conventional arrangements. Opposition Members have been grasping at straws to find reasons to oppose making voting more convenient. We want to make voting easier because we know that there are difficulties with turnout, particularly in local and European elections, and we are simply proposing that we find a way to ensure that we improve engagement in our democratic process. That is why we picked the four regions.</p>

However, although the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats talk about the potential for fraud, the Lords reasons say nothing whatever about it. What is more, the Lords reasons changed all the time. When the provision was sent back to us two weeks ago, the Lords reason for rejecting it was</p>

	<p pid=".1543.2/3">However, their reason for doing so today is</p>

We have been reasonable with the other place and responded to their worries about fraud and malpractice. We have bent over backwards to make changes to the Bill, including the concession that has disappointed many of my hon. Friends. They are disappointed about the inclusion of the declaration of identity to be a witness to the signature. The Electoral Commission advised that we should move towards a single signature arrangement. However, we made the concession, which proves that we have tried our best to listen to some of the more reasonable objections from the other place.</p>

Where is the hard evidence? He has anecdote, hearsay and allegations but no evidence that all-postal voting is any more prone to fraudulence than conventional arrangements. We have dealt firmly and completely with the argument about fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".1544.3/2">The arguments are now focusing on what the public prefer. They want the opportunity for all-postal voting. They clearly expressed that by voting in greater numbers in places where we piloted the scheme in local elections. We have the resources for four regions to do that. We know that the regional returning officers desperately want all-postal voting and that they want a decision to be made now. They would face a considerable challenge if the Conservative and Liberal Democrat alliance forced them to go back on their preparations, find the polling stations in the new ward boundaries that the boundary changes have created and recruit the staff to conduct the elections. It would be a considerable challenge if the north-west were forced to revert to a conventional arrangement. I hope that Conservative Members and Liberal Democrat Members will reconsider and reflect on the fact that the House&mdash;reasonably but determinedly&mdash;wants to ensure that four regions are included in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".1544.3/3">Important principles are at stake. Of course, there is a wider question about the elected House of Commons making decisions. However, it is also important that, having thoroughly examined all the aspects of the Bill and made concessions when necessary, we have the opportunity to take forward the decision that the provision for four regions is right. I hope that hon. Members will agree that it is time to settle the matter.</p>

	<p pid=".1545.2/1">The Minister still does not recognise the fatal weakness in the Government's case, which is that as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December</phrase>, on this same Bill, the Government said not once or twice but many times that they only intended there to be three pilot regions. As we know, the Electoral Commission originally recommended only two. The Government said that they intended to bring forward plans for a third, and they said it not once but many times. Then, suddenly, out of the blue, only five days after this Minister said that he intended to bring forward plans for a third region, they announced that they wanted there to be four. They wanted the whole of England north of the Trent to be chosen, and, for their partisan party political reasons, all of the areas that face referendums later on regional government. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister has been so obsessed by this matter.</p>
	<p pid=".1545.2/2">The Government have had the benefit of the advice of their Electoral Commission&mdash;they set it up. As my noble Friend Baroness Hanham said:</p>
	<p pid=".1545.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The Opposition did not set up the Electoral Commission&mdash;the Government did. They had a long report from it, part of which said that it thought that it would be suitable for two European electoral regions to be part of the electoral pilot&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2004-03-25.856"><i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 25 March 2004; Vol. 659, c. 856</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1545.2/4">We have had this debate many times. This is about round eight of the contest. One thing has changed, which is that the Government are finding it difficult to get their own peers out to support their policy. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1145" name="George Osborne">the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase> pointed out, with the decreased majority in the other place, had the Government managed to get all the Labour peers to vote earlier, the result might have been different. I understand that it is difficult for the Government to get their own peers to support much of their policy, not just on this Bill but on many other matters. If the Government's problem is not so much the battle between the two Houses but their whipping in the other place, that really is serious.</p>

	<p pid=".1548.4/1">Let me develop my argument a little further.</p>
	<p pid=".1548.4/2">Unfortunately, if the Lords hold to their proposals, we are now going to have a hybrid. Everyone has the chance to go to a polling station, but many people in the north-west will be annoyed that the House of Lords has thwarted their opportunity to have a postal ballot automatically. What will they then do? They will apply, as they have every right to do, for a postal vote over the next six or seven weeks. Instead of most people going to the polling station and just 3 or 4 per cent. voting by post, anything up to 25 or 30 per cent. of people will apply for postal votes. That will produce circumstances that are extremely difficult for returning officers to cope with. All the polling stations have to be in place, but so will most of the postal mechanisms, producing the worst of all worlds.</p>
	<p pid=".1548.4/3">Conservative Members say that they are concerned about fraud. There may have been some fraud with postal votes, but the fraud has been in the traditional, not the experimental areas, and has affected a relatively small number of votes. It might have been better to take earlier action to reduce the possibility of such fraud. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/958" name="Lady Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase> said, steps were taken in Northern Ireland to achieve that, but it is not an option at this particular moment. My plea to the House of Lords is to make certain that we can have an all-postal ballot, which can be supervised as efficiently as any other system to reduce fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".1548.4/4">As it stands now, people can apply for a postal vote to be sent to any named address. That makes it possible for people to collect such votes, which they should not be doing. Under an all-postal vote, however, those votes go to the address on the electoral register, which provides a very important safeguard. In fact, an all-postal ballot makes an election safer and less likely to result in fraud than one in which law-abiding citizens are put to the inconvenience of having to go to the polling station, when those who want to perpetrate fraud or malpractice can get postal votes.</p>
	<p pid=".1548.4/5">I repeat my strong plea to the House of Lords closely to examine the current position. If the Lords want to eliminate or reduce fraud, the most effective way of doing so is to have an all-postal ballot in the north-west of England. That is clearly what most of my constituents want, and if the Lords try to deny them that opportunity it will spur many of them to secure postal votes, which will create the worst possible administrative nightmare for electoral registration officers.</p>

	<p pid=".1549.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/728" name="Andrew Bennett">the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Bennett)</phrase>, although I would like to do so with slightly less frequency on this subject. I suggested yesterday evening that we were experiencing a version of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, but I retract that comment because according to my recollection of the film, things eventually got better. Unfortunately, we seem to be making no progress with the Bill whatsoever, due to the Government's intransigence.</p>
	<p pid=".1549.0/2">The facts of the case remain exactly as they always were. The Government wish to have pilot schemes&mdash;I stress the phrase &quot;pilot schemes&quot;&mdash;for all-postal voting, and they have considerable support, certainly from Liberal Democrats, in doing so. They said that they wanted three regions, and felt that that was an appropriate scale for the trial. That is exactly what they have in the Bill, before they amend it this evening. They set up the Electoral Commission some time ago in order to give advice, and they sought its advice on which and how many regions would be suitable. We realise that they were disappointed with the commission's initial response, which was that only two regions could be positively recommended.</p>

It is in order to avoid ugly confrontations between the parties on matters on which there should be consensus and agreement. Indeed, that is exactly why we have the boundary commission. Of course, we remember the last Government who tried to overrule the boundary commission&mdash;it was Jim Callaghan in 1969 who tried to gerrymander the constituencies. That was a huge mistake, as even Labour party members now accept. What prevented that Government from doing so was the constitutional role of the other place.

If it is so imperative for the east midlands, why is it not for the west midlands? If it is so imperative for the north of England, why is it not for the south of England, or Scotland or Wales?

	<p pid=".1551.9/3">The Government simply say that we have to increase turnout, but only in those regions where we choose to increase turnout. I have said all the way along the line that had the Government come forward with a proposal for universal postal voting across the whole country, I could have understood that. That would have had a logic to it. There is a logic to doing it across the whole country and there is a logic to having pilots.

If we are seriously holding pilots to improve election technique, what better control could there be than to hold all-postal elections in Yorkshire and Humber on one side of the Pennines and in the north-west on the other side? We could then compare the two. We could look at the problems, such as the level of any fraud that took place and any difficulties in the system, and make sensible arrangements for universal provision.

	<p pid=".1556.2/1">We have only a few minutes, and I have only a few points to make. This ping-pong cannot go on indefinitely. I want the north-west to be included in the postal ballots, but we have a common interest in ensuring that the integrity of the ballot is maintained. That does not divide us.</p>
	<p pid=".1556.2/2">Reference has been made throughout the debate to what happened in Pendle in 2002. Members can read the remarks of Lord Greaves in the Lords <i>Hansard</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-29">29 January</phrase>. It is all set out there, but the fact is that, after a year-long police investigation, no prosecutions were brought and there were no convictions. I am getting fed up with the constant smearing about what is happening in my constituency. Some practices are not unlawful, but they are unsavoury. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/728" name="Andrew Bennett">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Bennett)</phrase> referred to the fact that it is not unlawful to send postal ballots to an address other than the voter's address. That is an incredible state of affairs, but it is true. If postal ballots are universal in the north-west on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-10">10 June</phrase>, as I hope, every elector will get his or her postal ballot delivered to his or her own address. That will do more than anything else to combat fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".1556.2/3">The Electoral Commission produced a report, with a series of recommendations, a year ago in March 2003. I am glad to say that one of those recommendations has been picked up by the Government and forms the basis of the Government amendment tonight. That is good&mdash;I welcome it&mdash;but the Electoral Commission's other recommendations are still in the pipeline. I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that to nail those smears&mdash;if that is what people do to smears&mdash;let us put in place those recommendations from the Electoral Commission. I am thinking about the development of a protocol that considers who is responsible for following up allegations of electoral fraud. That was suggested by the Electoral Commission a year ago. Let us do it now, and let us send people who are guilty of electoral fraud to prison for a long time. That is what Labour Members want because we believe in maintaining the integrity of the ballot. Rigorous checks should be made after significant elections to unearth fraud if it takes place. All those recommendations have been around for a year and I want the Government to act on them.</p>
	<p pid=".1556.2/4">Before my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1009" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman)</phrase> tries to intervene, let me conclude by saying that I am fed up with all the spurious arguments that have been recycled three, four or five times in the House of Lords. The will of the elected House must prevail on this matter. Let us vote this through and let us have clean elections on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-10">10 June</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".1557.0/1">When this process started, I really did not believe the conspiracy theory that it was a ploy to get more Labour votes. I was genuinely relaxed about the electoral outcome. I could see the arguments for and the good arguments against. However, tonight I have been astonished by the Government's unwillingness to compromise with the Lords and the Electoral Commission, by their willingness to find more and more time in the parliamentary calendar for this quite small piece of legislation, and by the massive turnout in force of Government luminaries, including the Leader of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1557.0/2">If this issue were just about electoral pilots and not Labour's political advantage, why has there been all this pressure and excitement among Labour Members? The game has already been given away by the reference by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1310" name="Dave Watts">the hon. Member for St. Helens, North (Mr. Watts)</phrase> to the Liverpool outcome and by the reference by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1158" name="Colin Pickthall">the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall)</phrase> to what the British National party might do. Fundamentally, it has been given away by the excitement of Labour Members.</p>

	<p pid=".1562.1/1">With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a short business statement. Further to my business statement of last week, the House will wish to know that we may now consider any further Lords message that may be received either at the commencement or the conclusion of business on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".1562.2/1">Is it not appropriate that it will be April fools' day when the Government will be using extra time to force through changes to the electoral system in the face of the opposition of the Electoral Commission and all parties in this Parliament? Even the Greens voted with us in the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid=".1562.2/2">Will the time for the Easter Adjournment debate on Thursday be protected? Can the right hon. Gentleman assure us that there will no other ministerial statements that day? Is he aware that a third of the Labour Lords failed to attend the vote today in the other place? Instead of continuing his vendetta with the other place, will he think again and remember the correct procedure in this country for changing electoral procedures? We should reach agreement among all the parties and not have these sorts of changes pushed through using a temporary Commons majority, which if the Government go on this way will not last another year.</p>

	<p pid=".1562.3/1">May I remind the hon. Gentleman that April fools' day ends at midday, and that these matters will be discussed after midday? He should at least get his early interventions correct.</p>
	<p pid=".1562.3/2">This was not done in the face of the advice of the Electoral Commission. All the pilot areas selected, which were all proposed by the Government, were recommended by the commission in either the first or second category. Surely the hon. Gentleman will understand that the intention is to hold all-postal referendums in October, just three to four months after these elections. It is a matter of getting the pilots going so that we have the postal voting in place so that it can continue in October.</p>
	<p pid=".1562.3/3">The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be any other statements on Thursday. I cannot give him that assurance. Nor can I give him an assurance that we will go beyond 6 pm.</p>
	<p pid=".1562.3/4">This is a simple business statement to deal with an unprecedented situation. According to the records that we have been able to discover, we have never been in a situation where the House of Lords has disagreed on so many occasions. We hope that after the narrow vote&mdash;only six votes prevented the Government's position from being carried in the other place&mdash;there will be a reasonable reconsideration. We are grateful for the support that has been received from Cross-Bench peers, who understand that this is a matter of democracy. It is in the interests of the majority of people to be able to vote. Postal votes encourage them to do so, and all good democrats should support that.</p>

	<p pid=".1563.2/1">The House of Lords, instead of acting as a revising Chamber, is pitting its will against the House of Commons. That was precisely what the Liberal party decided to prevent in 1910 when its Budget was rejected by the House of Lords. That was why the Parliament Act 1911 was passed with a Liberal majority in this place.</p>

	<p pid=".1563.11/1">The terms of the business motion imply that the views of the Electoral Commission are to be disregarded. I am sure that the Leader of the House did not intend to mislead the House a few minutes ago. The chairman of the Electoral Commission&mdash;to whom the right hon. Gentleman and other hon.

	<p pid=".1564.1/1">I understand precisely what you are saying, Madam Deputy Speaker. As the Leader of the House indicated, this is germane to the business motion before the House. We are being asked in very difficult circumstances to deal with an extremely important issue on which the advisers to both the Government and Parliament&mdash;the Electoral Commission&mdash;have indicated their view. The Leader of the House made great play of the fact that the other place is not elected. That is in his hands. His Government do not have the guts to change the composition of the other place.

Will he make a commitment that those of us who want to raise matters of far more importance to my constituents than this ping-pong will have a suitable amount of time in which to hold that debate on Thursday?</p>

	<p pid=".1568.2/1">I am most grateful for this opportunity to raise my concerns over the proposed closure of four sub-post offices in my constituency. I have followed very closely the discussions, which have taken place over many years under two different Governments regarding the future of the post office network. I have fully accepted the need to modernise the network to respond to social, economic and technological changes. I have strongly supported the Horizon project, the logic of the provision of modern online IT facilities and, in particular, the extension of the Post Office's arrangement with the high street banks.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/2">I welcomed the installation of cash machines and the overall automation of the network, which led to the Post Office becoming a gateway for delivering electronic and other services. In correspondence with constituents and the occasional anxious sub-postmaster or mistress, I have argued the logic of modernising the network, in the genuine belief that the proposals were in the best interests of the people whom I represent. However, in the past three months, to cite Jarvis Cocker, I have come to the gradual, soul-destroying realisation that I have been most monumentally had.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/3">What I believed to be modernisation turned out to be marketisation; what is termed &quot;urban reinvention&quot; means, in my back yard, putting the boot into some of my most vulnerable constituents. Frankly, I did not expect that from a Labour Government. If the Minister intends to tell me that it is a matter for the Post Office, I say to him now that that simply will not wash. We were used to Pontius Pilate jobs under the Tories, but I am not prepared to accept that from my party. The Minister can and should do something.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/4">As the Minister knows, the proposals to close the Thornes, St. Michael's, Agbrigg road and Haddingley Hill sub-post offices were announced in a letter that was sent out by the Post Office's head of area, Mr. David Mellows-Facer, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-29">29 December</phrase> last year. The Minister will appreciate that probably the best time to make such an unpopular announcement is between Christmas and new year. Parliament is not sitting and most Members of Parliament and other public representatives are having a Christmas break. In short, the announcement was a classic Jo Moore job&mdash;burying the bad news.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/5">I found out about the proposals from the local press. I strongly resent the fact that I received such important information at second hand. I did not receive Mr. Mellows-Facer's letter until <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-09">9 January</phrase>, because it was sent to the wrong address. Given that my constituency office has been listed as my contact address for many years, and that the other, fairly obvious point of contact for a Member of Parliament is the House of Commons, it is astonishing that the letter was sent to the Yorkshire regional Labour party headquarters.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/6">Even if I had received the letter on time, it is unacceptable that my constituents and I were given only until <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-09">9 February</phrase> to respond to what was described as &quot;a consultation process&quot;. I had less than four weeks to develop a detailed response to proposals that will undoubtedly have a serious impact on the lives of the people whom I represent. That is disgraceful. However, it was par for the course. The kindest thing that I can say about the consultation process is that it was a complete joke. Unfortunately, it is hard to see the funny side when three of the four closures impact on some of the most disadvantaged areas in my constituency, and the fourth, Thornes, affects an especially large population of elderly people.If the Post Office had deliberately targeted the most vulnerable in picking out those four sub-post offices, it could not have done a better job.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/7">The Minister knows that I tabled a series of parliamentary questions about the way in which the Post Office has developed its proposals and consultation process. I am disappointed with the answers that I have received so far. They have been very much in the &quot;not me, guv&quot; mode. I was especially disappointed that the Minister refused to instruct the Post Office to publish a profile of the select teams of personnel who walked between each sub-post office that was proposed for closure in Wakefield and the named alternative branch. Not unreasonably, I believed that it was important to know how many members of the select teams replicated the age profile of the customers who would be expected to travel further afield, and how many were physically disabled, wheelchair users, the elderly and very elderly, or people wheeling pushchairs and accompanied by young children.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/8">I have received many letters from people who are angry and deeply upset about the way in which the proposals will impact on them and their loved ones. I shall read only one, which was sent directly to Mr. Mellows-Facer by the daughter of an elderly couple who would be affected by the proposed Thornes closure. She wrote:</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/9" class="indent">&quot;My father is 85 years of age and practically housebound, being cared for by my 80 year old mother who collects their pension weekly from the Thornes Post Office. It is a manageable 20 minute walk there and back for her and she can meet and chat to friends on the way. (In addition, she can buy essentials such as milk from this branch.) It is also a short break from the house for her, as she does not like to leave my father on his own for much longer than half an hour at a time.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/10" class="indent">You suggest that she could use the 119/120 bus service to access either the Kirkgate or the Lupset Bar branches if the Thornes branch is closed. This bus service runs hourly in each direction. After collecting their pension from the Kirkgate branch, my mother would have to cross the busy Kirkgate road to catch the return bus. At the Lupset Bar branch she would have to walk down to the bus stop by the park and then would have an hour's wait, in the open as there are no facilities for shelter etc, on this road. The local newspaper, the <i>Wakefield Express</i>, has also recently reported that this bus service is to be curtailed in future as it is not well used.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/11" class="indent">Both alternative branches are too far away for my mother to walk to and so the only other solution is for her to take a taxi. I find it disgraceful that she should have to pay taxi fares every week to collect their pensions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/12">In a later letter to me, she said:</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/13" class="indent">&quot;After much discussion my parents have decided to register to collect their pension at the general post office on Northgate. My mother now has to catch a bus on Denby Dale road into town, walk to the GPO, collect her money, walk back to the bus station, and catch another bus home again&mdash;all this at 80 years of age&mdash;plus my father has to be left alone while she travels to Wakefield. Once again it is the elderly, who find it hardest to cope, who are inconvenienced in the name of progress.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/14">If they are using the general post office in Northgate, I only hope that this elderly lady can cope with queuing for up to half an hour, which is apparently a frequent experience that will no doubt worsen as a consequence of the proposed closures.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/15">I was also disappointed with the Minister's answer to my question on the steps taken to monitor the factual accuracy of information on which closure proposals have been based. He told me on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-22">22 March</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/16" class="indent">&quot;The public consultation process enables any factual inaccuracies in the proposals to be identified&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-03-22.520"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 March 2004; Vol. 419, c. 520W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/17">What he did not say is what difference it makes to closure proposals when the information on which they are based is found to be fundamentally flawed.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/18">I do not have the time to detail all the erroneous information contained in the consultation document. The farcical nature of procedures that the Minister appears to be defending, however, is particularly well illustrated by the proposals concerning the St. Michael's sub-post office. Dewsbury road, Wakefield, is described as</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/19" class="indent">&quot;a rural area of mixed occupations, with some of the population working in agriculture and crafts&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/20">I invite the Minister to take a stroll with me through the rural idyll that is Dewsbury road, Wakefield. I will give him a fiver for every chicken, cow and pig that he sees, and a tenner if he meets a farmer. The simple fact is that Dewsbury road is an urban, built-up area running from Westgate End to the city and constituency boundary. Whoever says otherwise is living in cloud cuckoo land.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/21">The Post Office's assessment of those served by the Thornes sub-post office also confirms the cloud cuckoo land theory. Apparently, the population is &quot;largely young&quot;. It is not. It has among the highest numbers of elderly and very elderly people in my constituency. Alms houses in Horne street and the Whitehouse bungalows are among several that specifically accommodate the elderly. The Thornleigh estate and Thornes Moor estate house significant numbers of retired constituents who, like the elderly couple to whom I have already referred, may simply be unable to access the proposed alternative in Kirkgate.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/22">The assessment of St. Michael's sub-post office talks of a &quot;largely young population&quot; who presumably will have little trouble accessing the alternatives, providing that they can avoid the cow pats on Dewsbury road. I have a rather different impression, however, of a population with a large number of low-income and elderly people. Neither of the alternatives proposed, and in particular the Dewsbury road sub-post office, is within walking distance, especially for elderly people, and this closure will cause particular difficulties for many of the current customers.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/23">As I pointed out in my written response to Mr. Mellows-Facer, many of the current users of the Agbrigg road sub-post office are elderly and disabled people from the Belle Vue area, who had to use Agbrigg road sub-post office when the Doncaster road sub-post office closed some years ago. This is a low-income area with low car ownership, and suggesting Sandal sub-post office as an alternative for most of the current users is completely inappropriate, given the difficulty of accessing it from Agbrigg and Belle Vue, especially for residents living to the east of Doncaster road.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/24">The customer profile of Haddingley Hill sub-post office describes</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/25" class="indent">&quot;a large number of young families&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/26">but turns a now familiar blind eye to the impact of the closure on the large number of elderly and very elderly people currently served. Why is there no mention of the fact that this outlet is used by a large number of elderly people living in flats and other purpose-built accommodation in Manygates crescent and Duke of York avenue? Why is there no mention of the fact that immediately across the road are the flats and sheltered housing complexes in Woodcock street and Sparable lane? Why, according to one of the Minister's answers to me, are the health and social care implications of the closures</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/27" class="indent">&quot;operational matters for Post Office Ltd&quot;?&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-03-22.520"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 March 2004; Vol. 419, c. 520W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/28">Has the Minister never been contacted by a sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress in his constituency who is concerned about some aspect of the health and well-being of an elderly customer, or does that only happen in Yorkshire? Is it not right that those people have served as a point of contact with outside help for those who may have few other ways of obtaining such help?</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/29">Let me illustrate the problem by referring to the individual circumstances of two people. The first is a gentleman who lived a few streets away from me until he died a couple of years ago. His name was Alf Watson, and he served his country during world war two. He never recovered from some of the things that happened then. He was an accomplished rugby league player and played professionally on the Leeds side which played in the challenge cup final against Bradford Northern, at Wembley in 1947. Towards the end of his life, when he was not finding things easy, he had two particular props&mdash;I use the word &quot;props&quot; in the widest sense. One was a very good neighbour; the other was the former sub-postmaster at Haddingley Hill sub-post office, who helped Alf retain his independence against all the odds. Significantly, when Alf died he left his most prized possessions&mdash;his rugby league medals&mdash;to the former sub-postmaster. The Minister may regard such a caring role as</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/30" class="indent">&quot;operational matters for Post Office Ltd&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/31">but I regard it as basic humanity. I hope the Government may encourage such basic humanity.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/32">The second person I want to mention illustrates the fact that the consultation process take no account of the likely impact of the proposed closure on the local economy in the immediate area of three of the four sub-post offices in Wakefield, which are located near other retail outlets. I feel that that impact should have been considered.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/33">This second gentleman is 83, with a similarly distinguished war record. He is a widower living alone in the Milnthorpe area of Wakefield, which was removed from my constituency in 1997 by the Boundary Commission. For some reason it felt that Farnley Tyas near Huddersfield had more in common with Wakefield city. This gentleman has taken the modernisation agenda fully on board, accessing his Co-op bank account and conducting his domestic financial transactions at Haddingley Hill sub-post office. He takes a taxi from his home to Haddingley Hill, or &quot;busy corner&quot; as it is more commonly known, where he also visits the freezer centre, the chemist, the butcher/greengrocer and the newsagent. He has been known very occasionally to visit the off-licence and the pub, The Foresters&mdash;but not, as far as I am aware, the suntan centre. There are two sub-post offices near where he lives, but neither has adjacent parades of shops where he can obtain all that he needs for the week. He could go to a supermarket, but is not up to walking around it or queueing at the checkout. He and many others like him have been simply disregarded in the closure process.</p>
	<p pid=".1568.2/34">The gentleman's name, by the way, is the right hon. Walter Harrison. He is my predecessor as Member for Wakefield, which he represented for 23 years. He was probably the most legendary Whip ever to pin a Back Bencher against a wall&mdash;but he will not be pinning me against a wall for refusing to support the Government in last week's vote on post offices. Like many others in my area who have solidly supported the Labour party all their lives, he shares my view that what is happening to our sub-post offices is not what we expected of a Labour Government. Both he and I sincerely hope that it is not too late for the Minister to do something about it.</p>

	<p pid=".1572.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/963" name="David Hinchliffe">the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has been very energetic in voicing local concerns about the post office closure proposals on behalf of his constituents, and he made a powerful speech this evening, not least when citing the name of Walter Harrison in support of his case. He tabled a number of parliamentary questions on the subject over the past few weeks, and I endeavoured to answer them&mdash;albeit not, as he made clear, entirely to his satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/2">My hon. Friend has clearly spelled out his views and concerns about the impact of the post office closures that will shortly take place in his constituency and about the consultation process that preceded those decisions. I am grateful to him for accepting the need for change. He said that he was concerned about the process of marketisation, but I would make the point that sub-post offices have always been private businesses&mdash;for more than 100 years, going right back to the beginnings of the Post Office. Those who run sub-post offices as private businesses must be able to make a reasonable living, and it is part of the Government's responsibility to ensure that that occurs. That provides an important part of the background to the process of change that we are currently going through.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/3">I agree with my hon. Friend, for precisely the reasons that he set out, about the importance of maintaining a viable nationwide network of post offices. It is important that sub-post offices and their proprietors, the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, are able, as they always have, to provide strong support to vulnerable individuals among their customers. My hon. Friend is right to make that point, which is one of the reasons why it is important that the Government maintain a viable nationwide network of post offices and stop unmanaged gaps from opening up in that network.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/4">The starting point of our policy for the network is the performance and innovation unit's 2000 report, with which my hon. Friend will be familiar, &quot;Modernising the Post Office Network&quot;. It was widely welcomed as squaring up honestly and finally to the challenges that the network faces. It made 24 recommendations for the future, all of which the Government accepted. The PIU report showed quite starkly that our network of post offices had not kept pace with the changing needs of its customers, and that too often post offices had become dingy and shabby through lack of investment, as a result of which the network was losing business.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/5">The Post Office faces an enormous challenge. For the last financial year, Post Office Ltd. lost &pound;194 million before exceptional items. In the previous year, it lost &pound;163 million. About 97 per cent. of the nation's post offices are private businesses run by sub-postmasters, but with declining profitability in the network as a whole&mdash;and, in very many cases, at individual office level&mdash;the ability of those sub-postmasters to sell on their businesses has also declined. That is how they often moved on in the past, but it has taken a very severe knock. Decisive action was needed to ensure that we maintained a sustainable countrywide network for the future, which is the action that the Government have been taking.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/6">My hon. Friend knows that the post office network has been contracting since the 1960s. There have been reductions in post office usage for all sorts of reasons, and the absence of investment in the past was an important one, but big changes in technology, greater mobility, changes in shopping and financial habits have all meant that a large proportion of all our constituents are simply not using the post office in the way that they used to&mdash;and custom has sharply reduced as a result.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/7">Before responding to some of my hon. Friend's points, I mention some telling comparative figures. In 1996, 26 per cent. of benefit recipients received their cash paid directly into their bank accounts; in April last year, just before the transition to direct payments started, that proportion had risen to 43 per cent. In quite a short period, dramatic reductions in the use of the post office network took place, which we needed to take into account.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/8">If we want an urban post office network that is the right size for the volume of business now available to it, there have to be&mdash;in addition to the new technology and the introduction of banking facilities that my hon. Friend welcomed&mdash;closures in the urban network. I do not know whether my hon. Friend feels that a different set of four sub-post offices should have been proposed for closure, but that was the key question facing the Post Office and Postwatch in embarking on this exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/9">I gather that, at the start of the programme, there were 31 post offices in my hon. Friend's constituency, of which 13 were classified by Post Office Ltd. as urban. Last September, Post Office Ltd decided to prepare closure proposals on an area plan basis, using the parliamentary constituencies grouped together, where appropriate, to give a clearer, &quot;once over the ground&quot; view of future service provision. I take my hon. Friend's point about the awkwardness of the date of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-29">29 December</phrase>, but he will appreciate that announcements are continually being made, given the scale of the exercise. Nevertheless, he makes a fair point about the date on which the area plan was published. There were four closure proposals in respect of the branches that he has mentioned.</p>
	<p pid=".1572.0/10">Postwatch considered each of the proposals carefully before concluding that, in this case, there were insufficient grounds to oppose them. It therefore chose not to refer the four proposals to the escalation and review process. I have looked at Postwatch's comments, and in all four cases it accepted that there was not enough business for the branches to remain viable. In each case, there is an alternative office located within half a mile or so. Postwatch draws attention to one important consideration. In its view, the closure of two branches&mdash;Agbrigg road and Haddingley Hill&mdash;enabled the strengthening, and therefore the long-term viability, of two other offices in designated deprived urban locations that are not too far away, and which might otherwise themselves have been at risk.</p>

	<p pid=".1574.0/1">I am listening carefully to what the Minister is saying, but Agbrigg road in particular has heard it all before. Exactly the same arguments were advanced when people were relocated from Doncaster road. Will he address my concern about what happens when people have to relocate and to use the general post office? My secretary took four huge parcels to the general post office yesterday, and she had to queue for half an hour in order to send them here by registered post. People regularly have to queue there for half an hour. It simply is not on when people in their 80s have to wait that long to access a service.</p>

	<p pid=".1574.1/1">I accept my hon. Friend's point entirely, but I should point out that two post offices in his constituency&mdash;the Kirkgate and Windhill road branches&mdash;have submitted applications for improvement grants from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Up to &pound;50,000 can be applied for in such cases; however, the results of those applications have yet to be determined. The programme provides an opportunity to improve other branches, in order to help them to cope with the additional custom that they will receive.</p>
	<p pid=".1574.1/2">My hon. Friend mentioned the delay that he suffered in being informed of the proposals, and I shall certainly ask the Post Office what happened. He said that the letter was sent to the wrong address, and I entirely sympathise with his anger at finding out about these proposals through the local press. That certainly should not happen and it is not the Post Office's intention; I shall endeavour to find out what went wrong. This may not be of much comfort to my hon. Friend, but in response to a number of problems that are not dissimilar to the ones he described, I told the House in a statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-05">5 February</phrase> about some changes to the consultation process. They include the requirement that Members of the House be informed one week before these proposals go out to wider public consultation. I hope that that will help to avoid other Members facing the difficulties that he has faced through finding out so late. Such changes reflect my concern that the reasoning behind the decisions being taken was not being explained as clearly as it should have been. I think that the changes announced in my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-05">5 February</phrase> have helped.</p>
	<p pid=".1574.1/3">My hon. Friend expressed some concerns about disabled access and the facilities in post offices. The Post Office is taking action to meet the requirements, as it has to, of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Disability awareness training, for example, has been provided to all staff. In a number of branches, drop-down counters, electronically aided doors and mobile hearing induction loops are being installed. I understand that a number of those measures are to be taken in my hon. Friend's constituency.</p>

	<p pid=".1575.0/1">There are only a couple of minutes left. One of the key points to which I wanted my hon. Friend to respond was the fundamental flaws and inaccuracies in the consultation document. The nature of the areas that the sub-post offices served was assessed wrongly. Will my hon. Friend address that point?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2004-03-30.1575.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1281" speakername="Stephen Timms" colnum="1575"  time="021:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040330/debtext/40330-46.htm#40330-46_spnew3">
	<p pid=".1575.1/1">Yes. I am not able to explain to him how Dewsbury road was described as a rural road, given what he has said. I can only say to my hon. Friend that I will take that away and find out what happened.</p>
	<p pid=".1575.1/2">I am satisfied, and certainly the experience across the country is, that Postwatch scrutinises all the proposals thoroughly and rigorously. If Postwatch concludes that the proposals are wrong&mdash;on the basis of walking around the area and having a look at it&mdash;it does not hesitate to oppose the closures that have been proposed. On this occasion, its view was that the proposals, although there were some issues that should be looked at, should not be opposed.</p>
	<p pid=".1575.1/3">Let me also respond to the point about queueing times. He has tabled parliamentary questions about that with regard to the main Crown office in Wakefield. He described his secretary's experiences there recently. I understand that the office is not expected to be the main receiving branch for much of the custom migrating from the offices that will close, but Post Office Ltd will monitor the position at that office very carefully and, if it needs to, will flex the staffing times or increase the staffing hours to meet additional demand.</p>
	<p pid=".1575.1/4">My hon. Friend expressed concerns about Postwatch. I say to him again that Postwatch has been vigorous and forthright. Indeed, it was the concerns articulated to me by Postwatch as well as several Members of Parliament that convinced me of the need to review the consultation arrangements urgently and led to the changes that I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-05">5 February</phrase>, which I hope will ensure that problems of the kind that my hon. Friend has suffered will not occur in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".1575.1/5">Like my hon. Friend, Postwatch has recognised from the beginning of the exercise that action is needed to ensure the future survival and viability of the network. It accepted that, with too many post offices competing for the same customers in many urban areas, it would not be possible to oppose every individual closure where it was clear that customers would have&mdash;</p>
