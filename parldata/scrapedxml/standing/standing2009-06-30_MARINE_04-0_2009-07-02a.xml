<p> I was saying this morning that the debate goes to the heart of how we manage not only our fisheries but our marine environment. It is undoubtedly true that the Government&#146;s thrust is to stop keeping those two entities in the silos that have held them for so long&#151;one being the common fisheries policy and the other being our marine conservation efforts. Part of the long-term thrust will be achieved through our existing proposals. I led the way in a recent debate in the European Union, and the argument was partly about bringing together the marine environment and fisheries and removing them from those silos. Ultimately, of course, that was the focus of much of this morning&#146;s debate.</p>
<p>Today&#146;s debate was good. As I said, the subject was discussed by several Members on Second Reading and by seven members of the Committee this morning, ably led by my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire. The hon. Member for Newbury, who leads for the Opposition, said that it is right to reflect on the fact that many parts of our fishing fleet operate sustainably and take an increasingly responsible approach, so we should not target them all for fishing recklessly or without due care.</p>
<p>One point touched upon this morning was that we must ensure that the rules apply equally to fishermen from the UK and from elsewhere; and&#151;a point that I shall return to in a moment&#151;to fishermen working in different zones. We do not want rules for those who fish out to 6 or 12 miles and another for those who fish beyond that limit. Let me explain why.</p>
<p>I compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West on his ingenious amendment. It is an attempt to deal with the question of UK fisheries and others, but it produces another complication. The amendment would limit the defence set out in clause 141(4) to those areas of interest to other EU member states. Let me turn that &nbsp;on its head. In effect, we would remove a defence for some of our fishermen, but those fishing on the other side of the line would be treated differently. Vessels from other member states would have a special status; they would always benefit from a defence that many UK fishermen could not.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we should do all that we can to protect our marine conservation zones, but that is not an equitable way of going about it. As was said this morning, we should not penalise our inshore fleet while larger offshore vessels remain unaffected. Fishermen need clarity about what they can and cannot do right across the boundaries. That is one reason for including the sea fishing defence.</p>
<p>More important, however, the amendment will not achieve what is sought. Through inshore fisheries and conservation authority byelaws, we are able to regulate fishing in the area between 0 and 6 nautical miles when necessary. Similarly, we can introduce fisheries orders under the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967, under which only UK fishermen have fishing rights without reference to Brussels. We intend to use both types of instrument when there is good evidence that it is necessary to protect MCZs. If fishing practices are likely to cause significant harm to MCZs, we will regulate them; and we will be able to prosecute offenders.</p>
<p>The sea fisheries defence does not have to be the complete disaster that many suggest. It is available only to those who can show that damage was done in the course of or in connection with sea fishing&#151;and, as important, that the effect of the fishing could not reasonably have been avoided. That is the key. Why is the condition that the effect of the act, the damage, could not have reasonably been avoided so important? It is important because if the damage could have reasonably been avoided, the defence does not apply.</p>
<p>Let me give an example. A person cannot rely on this defence if he is fishing using illegal gear. We talked earlier about the advances that have been made in the Scottish and English fleets and in other parts of the UK; much better gear is being used to avoid certain stocks and so on. However, if a fisherman was using illegal gear and as a result the damage was greater, he could not rely on this defence.</p>
<p>I understand the motivation behind the argument; we will take into the negotiations on reform of the CFP later this year. We have to make real changes there if we are going to take a step change forward. As I said at the outset, this is to do with integrating marine management with fisheries management. Having them in separate silos with different rules and regulations applying is complete anathema. We have to resolve this, but we need to do so in a way that does not disadvantage one part of the fleet, particularly inshore fishermen.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.2.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" time="13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s01.htm#09070267000033" colnum="106">
<p> We are talking about the six-mile zone limit particularly in relation to fisheries management. The Minister will be aware that in my part of the world inshore crabbers lay their pots along the six-mile zone, sometimes beyond it or well within it. As a result they often have their gear towed away by foreign vessels that are sweeping within the six-mile zone. It is an area of conflict, and the relationship with fishing states that are operating very much on the limits of that zone should be taken into consideration.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.2.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" time="13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s01.htm#09070267000034" colnum="107">
<p> I agree entirely. The motivation behind the amendment is right, but we need to act in a way that is equitable and proportionate. It is an intelligent and ingenious amendment that tries to avoid the situation where only UK fishermen are affected by the removal of the sea fisheries defence and our European neighbours do not have to comply. The amendment finesses that, but it would mean that our fleet out to a certain range would be disadvantaged, compared with those who fish slightly beyond it. That seems inequitable.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister for his kind words and I apologise for my absence this morning. I accept that the amendment is a probing amendment. Can he tell us what he proposes to do to persuade us not to press it to a Division, rather than just telling us that it will be swept up in a general reform of the common fisheries policy?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.2.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" time="13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s01.htm#09070267000036" colnum="107">
<p> I see the strength of feeling in the Committee and the recognition that this issue will need to be resolved, but it needs to be resolved in a clear and equitable way. I hope the Committee recognises that the Government share the ambition to get the necessary reform that will apply not only to our own fleet but to everybody who fishes in common seas, as well. I want to make it absolutely clear that removing the sea fisheries defence as a whole would leave us in clear breach of our EU obligations. There are no ifs or buts about that. It would be illegal for the UK Government to legislate in that way; it would be wide open to infraction proceedings.</p>
<p>However, I listened carefully to the debate this morning and to the interventions. Powerful points have been made and I can see that concern is deeply felt right across the Committee. On reflection, therefore, I am prepared to consider what more we can do to address the position, which I myself find less than ideal. I should like to find a way to get rid of the sea fisheries defence in an equitable way that is consistent with EU obligations as soon as possible. I cannot make any promises at the moment, because I need to talk to colleagues in Whitehall and, importantly, in the devolved Administrations. I hope to be able to return on Report with a helpful way forward.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.2.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1486" speakername="Nick Ainger" time="13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s01.htm#09070267000038" colnum="107">
<p> I listened carefully to the Minister, and he seems to accept that the Bill does not address the issue correctly, that the blanket defence is too widely drawn and that something needs to be done about it. He argues that we cannot get rid of a whole part of the clause, because he would face infraction proceedings from the Commission. I understand that argument. He also argues that we have to be equitable. The amendment&#146;s phrasing recognises that there is already a difference beyond the six-mile limit, as well as beyond the 12-mile limit. In other words, as the hon. Member for St. Ives has identified, no EU-flagged vessel should fish within the six-mile limit, but they do. There is inequity, because we have different rules in relation to the six-mile and 12-mile limits, so that is an issue.</p>
<p>The Minister has offered some nice words and has admitted that something needs to be done, but I am concerned about the timing. He referred to byelaws that can be put in place to address the issue in some way. &nbsp;When are they likely to be implemented? He also referred to another way of dealing with the matter through reform of the CFP. When is that likely to have any practical effect? I should be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response, because, judging by what he has said, he is moving in the right direction, but people remain concerned about the practical way in which the issue is going to be addressed, and about the timing of any proposed changes.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.2.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" time="13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s01.htm#09070267000040" colnum="108">
<p> My hon. Friend&#146;s comments are valid, because people want some certainty that the issue can be addressed through byelaws or through wider reform of the CFP. We have made clear our views on the way in which the CFP should be reformed, and I have made it clear today that the issue under discussion must form part of that. On the time scale for CFP reform, which we have already begun&#151;I led the way in the May Council with radical suggestions for reform&#151;we hope that it will be completed in the period up to 2011. Reform would therefore happen before the period in which we have a duty to introduce the ecologically coherent network of marine conservation zones.</p>
<p>If, after further discussion with Committee members and colleagues in the devolved Administrations and Whitehall, it is possible to return at a later stage with something we can agree on that would insert in the Bill a power for the Minister to remove the sea fisheries defence in a way that allows us to avoid infraction&#151;in other words, in a way parallel to what we are doing with CFP reform&#151;that might deliver on the issue before the whole network of marine conservation zones is up and running. In the broad scheme of things, that could be a relatively short-term process, bearing it in mind that the issue has been around for some time.</p>
<p>That is my line of thinking, and I think we will be able to return with something constructive. I am happy to discuss with Committee members what that might be and what would be workable. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friend to consider withdrawing the amendment so that we can address the issue further over the coming weeks.</p>

<p> I am pleased by the Minister&#146;s response.</p>
<p>I have just one more point. The Government&#146;s advisor on the marine environment out to the 12-mile nautical limit is Natural England, which has said quite clearly that it wants improvements&#151;strengthening, as it describes it&#151;to be made to the Bill. It would like to see the</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;inclusion of damage caused by disturbance to the offence of damaging a marine conservation zone. We would also like to see removal of the blanket defence of sea fishing.&#148;</p>

<p> May I seek your guidance, Mr. Gale? I have a clause stand part query. We had a very good debate on Tuesday about the planning side of the legislation.

<p> I will take that as a point of order. I will allow the Minister to make an observation in a moment. However, if I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, I have to say that we must consider the clause as it is, not as we would like it to be, because there are no amendments tabled.</p>

<p> Thank you for giving me some latitude, Mr. Gale. I will try to be helpful and to bring some clarity.</p>
<p>Following our debate and subsequent vote on Tuesday morning, I have had some time to reflect on the strong views of the Committee on some of the proposals, including those put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test. In response to our discussion about furthering sustainable development, which is material to the clauses we are coming to, he said:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;My hon. Friend makes a strong point about the comparative read-across of wording in the Bill, with other pieces of legislation that have or may not have a bearing on it. Schedule 5, however, is only relevant to the Bill and does not read across to other Acts. An amendment to that schedule, particularly to paragraph 7, could reflect the substance of this amendment. If he tabled such &nbsp;an amendment on Report he might secure a great degree of cross-party support.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<span class="italic">Official Report</span>, Marine and Coastal Access Public Bill Committee, 30 June 2009; c. 18.]</p>
<p>I can report to the Committee what has happened in the very short period since that debate. An amendment of such scale and potential impact would read across to Whitehall Departments and devolved colleagues&#151;of course this is a UK Bill. On reflection, I am minded to take constructively my hon. Friend&#146;s comments and to work with other Departments, devolved colleagues and members of the Committee in the weeks ahead to try to introduce something on Report that will satisfy my hon. Friend.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that the Bill maintains the right balance. The question surrounding a reporting function on the furthering of sustainable development is important, but placing such a duty on the Marine Management Organisation or making it part of a marine policy statement would risk causing an imbalance among the various interests under the Bill.</p>

<p> My apologies, Mr. Gale.</p>
<p>As I have said, I am willing to work with members of the Committee, and across Whitehall Departments and the devolved Administrations, to consider how to address genuine concerns about furthering sustainable development, but we are looking for an appropriate place to put it in the Bill. Given the constructive comments that were made on Tuesday morning, I urge hon. Members not to imbalance the Bill by imposing such a duty on the MMO or in the MPS. I might have to address those issues at a later stage, but I urge hon.

<p> Yes, Mr. Gale.</p>
<p>I am interested by the Minister&#146;s development of the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, but we have the opportunity of balancing the Bill later and accepting the Committee&#146;s earlier decision. My worry about this part of the Bill is that the MMO will not be as strong as many of us would like. If we do not balance the Bill&#151;I am choosing my words extremely carefully, as I do not want to re-enter a debate that we concluded on Tuesday&#151;we will further weaken it. I want a strong MMO, so I believe that we have to reflect the decision that the Committee made on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Science and engineering are very different disciplines. This will address the needs of an engineering discipline, such as marine renewable energy. Therefore the MMO will be allowed to appoint a Chief Engineering Adviser.</span></p>
<p>The amendment would provide that a chief engineering adviser would be appointed to work alongside the chief scientific adviser in the MMO. With renewable energy technology changing at such a rapid pace, and given the importance of climate change mitigation within the marine environment&#151;I have tabled other amendments related to that area&#151;it is important that the MMO is equipped with the appropriate expertise to deal with this very important area of marine management.</p>
<p>Science and engineering are very different disciplines, although there is a common misconception that they are synonymous. The appointment of a chief scientific adviser to the MMO is important for marine conservation, but it will not necessarily cover the needs of climate change mitigation and marine renewable energy. The appointment of a chief engineering advisor would be beneficial to a range of other marine users and industrial user groups, including those related to ports, cables and dredging. I re-emphasise that there is a rapid movement in green energy technologies, particularly in the marine environment, and the MMO needs to be equipped to deal with them. It needs to be able to give the Secretary of State good engineering advice. In addition, in its capacity as the champion of our seas, if it is properly to consider the sustainable green development of areas of our ocean, it needs to have the correct engineering advice.</p>

<p> I rise to support the amendment. I would have thought that the proposal was fairly uncontentious; indeed, I am rather surprised that such a measure is not in the Bill. If the MMO is to function properly, it must take into account all competing demands and certainly the development of green energy. I wonder whether I am losing the Minister&#146;s attention, Mr. Gale&#151;[Interruption.] Ah, the Under-Secretary of &nbsp;State for Scotland will respond to the debate, which just shows the importance of having two people. That is why we need a chief engineering advisor and a chief scientific advisor&#151;in case one or the other is off.</p>
<p>Offshore technology of one sort of another will be in demand in a lot of the areas we are talking about. We have already touched on offshore wind farms and wave projects, and a good wave project down in Plymouth is being funded by the South West of England Regional Development Agency, as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton will know. Such projects will require infrastructure and cabling&#151;the energy must be brought onshore&#151;but a chief scientific advisor is not necessarily the correct person to make judgments on those things. He would be well backed up by a chief engineering advisor, and the two people working together would cover almost every conceivable eventuality. The disciplines are different, and an engineering adviser would add to the MMO. I hope the Government will accept the amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.4.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" time="13:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s02.htm#09070267000086" colnum="112">
<p> I support the amendment. Given the strategic importance of the UK&#146;s marine energy resource, the timely delivery of renewable energy targets should surely be part of the MMO&#146;s remit and objectives. The fact is that some in the renewable energy sector are concerned that the MMO will be answerable solely to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and not to other Departments, and therefore that the organisation might have too much of an environmental base and might not be sufficiently considerate of the Government&#146;s climate change objectives. Those wider, global conservation considerations must surely be part of the MMO&#146;s activities.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for East Devon mentioned the South West of England RDA&#146;s wave hub project. In fact, it is not in Plymouth; it has been proposed and recently licensed for the north coast of my constituency. The cable will be set out from Hayle and anchored about 10 km off the north coast of my constituency. It is an exciting and experimental project, and it is vital that the UK takes the opportunity to lead the world in that aspect of scientific and engineering development. Such a window of opportunity has been provided by the licensing and preparatory work that is in place. I would be significantly reassured, not only on offshore wind facilities, which hon. Members have mentioned, but on tidal and wave renewables facilities, if the MMO had the capacity to consider not only the science, but the vital and complex engineering challenges that many stakeholders must consider. I hope that the Minister will take the amendment on board. Extending the appointments from science to engineering and ensuring that the organisation has such capacity is something that the Government should support.</p>

<p> Thank you, Mr Gale, good afternoon. Everyone will have welcomed the announcement early this morning that Christopher Parry will be chair designate of the Marine Management Organisation. That shows that we are making progress on the necessary preparations.</p>
<p>I do not accept the contention in the explanatory statement to the amendment:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Science and engineering are very different disciplines.&#148;</p>
<p>My late father spent many years lecturing thousands of engineering undergraduates in physics, and I am sure that he would say that science underpins an understanding of and is the basis of engineering. Engineering today requires knowledge of mathematics, physics, geology and biochemistry, particularly in the field of renewable energy, which, I fully accept is key to our economic growth and potential. Our chief scientific adviser, Professor Sir John Beddington, is not only the head of science in Government but of engineering, and represents the interests of both. The understanding has always been that chief scientific officers in Government encompass both disciplines, including engineering skills and the practical application of the sciences.</p>
<p>I do not know whether the shadow Chancellor, who keeps saying that the Government need to consider cutting bureaucracy and costs, would consider the appointment of yet another highly paid and pensioned civil servant a positive step. I shall leave that to one side.</p>
<p>Serious and genuine points about offshore renewable energy licensing have been made today. To be seen as a credible marine regulator, the MMO must be able to draw on its expertise to inform decision making, and we recognise that energy expertise must be part of that skill set.</p>
<p>Clause 2 requires the MMO to take account of all relevant facts and matters when making decisions and carrying out its functions. Where engineering expertise is relevant, the MMO will, of course, draw upon it as and when needed. It is not necessary to require the MMO to appoint a chief engineering adviser specifically. We have amended schedule 1 to require the MMO to appoint a chief science adviser in recognition of the cross-cutting and truly fundamental role that science will play in the new MMO.</p>
<p>I am not disputing the fact that engineering is important, not only for renewable energy, but for many other areas, such as oil and gas marine structures and the move to carbon capture, which require specialist engineering skills. It is important, not to justify and advise, but to ensure that we have in the MMO the necessary expertise and can call upon it. We are confident that the issue can be addressed as part of the MMO&#146;s wider recruitment and that the MMO will be able to bring in expertise through other means, because, depending on the type of application, special consultancy, rather than full-time staff, may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>The MMO will need to recruit new staff and develop them through training and interchange to ensure that the appropriate expertise is available from day one. Interchange is also a mechanism whereby the MMO can build its knowledge base through exchanges and strengthened links with partner organisations and industry. In addition, if the MMO decided that it needed to bring in further engineering expertise, it has the flexibility to do that without the specific power being included in the Bill.</p>
<p class="indent">Paragraph 16 of schedule 1 allows the MMO to appoint other employees. That could include specialist engineering staff, but that would be a decision for the chair and board, based on an analysis of the requirements at the time. To make prescriptions such as those in the amendment would be to micro-manage and remove the MMO&#146;S responsibility for regulating its own staffing &nbsp;and resource requirements. As an independent non-departmental public body, those decisions should be left to the MMO.</p>
<p>I hope that I have reassured hon. Members that the necessary plans are in place to ensure that the MMO has access to engineering expertise. I do not believe that that should be specified in the Bill, so I urge the hon. Member for Newbury to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p> Earlier today, in the Chamber, the Secretary of State announced the chairman of the MMO. An enormous amount of weight has been placed on the calibre of that individual. I look forward to meeting him and finding out more about him. As the Minister says, the MMO must create its own structures and organisation. It must be a credible organisation, because it has an enormous amount of work to do in a very short time. I do not intend to burden it with increased recruitment requirements that could impact on the other work it does during the set-up phase. However, I strongly believe that if we do not press the amendment today, the Government will have to revisit the matter in the future. The MMO&#146;s work will be enormously important, not just for electricity generation, but for the development of port facilities and the approach to dredging. For a variety of reasons, an intense cat&#146;s cradle and network of cables lies under our oceans.</p>
<p>As we move towards carbon capture and storage, the implications from an engineering perspective will be massive. I do not believe, like the Minister, that a synergy would exist between a chief scientific officer and the technical engineering disciplines in some emerging technologies. At this stage, however, I am not minded to press the amendment, although that has nothing to do with the shadow Chancellor&#146;s concerns, to which she referred. I am sure that the post could be financed from DEFRA&#146;s budget, probably to the enormous pleasure of interested parties across Britain&#146;s countryside that have to work with the Department. I am convinced that the matter will have to be revisited as the technologies emerge. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p> Amendments 28 and 26 get to the core of a theme that I raised on Tuesday: to ensure that this important legislation is underpinned by demonstrable local and coastal consultation and involvement in the planning, designation and implementation process. Later amendments of mine will go further on local accountability. Clearly missing from the Bill, especially this part of it, is the inter-relationship between what is, or could become, a highly centralised and remote&#151;although important&#151;Government agency unaccountable to coastal communities, and the coastal communities affected by the decisions and actions of the MMO.</p>

<p> My hon. Friend has touched on an important point. The MMO will be given the great task of safeguarding the marine environment and our coastal waters, but it is important that it keeps in contact with both the democratically elected local authority and, more importantly, communities, because they are the ones that will often deliver on its important work.</p>

<p> The amendment suggests that there should be at least one committee. In the hon. Gentleman&#146;s ideal world, how many committees would there be and how would they be constructed? Would people be elected to them, and by what electoral system? What terms would they serve and what would be their statutory role? [Interruption.]</p>

<p> The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for Ogmore suggests that I should be concerned more about the electoral system than about the number of committees or their geographical designation&#151;I favour AV-plus, by the way. The hon. Member for East Devon is perhaps teasing me, or perhaps proposing that, in addition to my important roles in the Committee and in representing St. Ives, I might offer to assist the MMO in designing its committees and sub-committees, but I am not proposing that I should provide or micro-manage a blueprint for the MMO to follow.</p>
<p>I propose that there should be at least one committee because, first and foremost, something should be enshrined, preferably in the Bill, to require the MMO to ensure that it reviews its capacity to consult the communities affected by its decisions and actions. Beyond that, it might well establish sub-committees that cover geographical regions, perhaps relating them to the IFCAs&#151;inshore fisheries and conservation authorities.</p>

<p> We could amend the Bill in several ways to ensure that, as a function of consultation, the needs, sensitivities and requirements of local coastal communities are taken into account. My intention in &nbsp;proposing the amendment was to ensure that we debate the issue and that the Minister considers the theme of consultation and the impact on coastal communities. I do not think that that is raised sufficiently in the Bill, which it needs to be, and I am not reassured. The amendment is a device to achieve that objective. I am not particularly precious about its operation, so if the hon. Member for Clwyd, West has a better suggestion, I will be happy to consider it.</p>

<p> In the interests of prompting that debate, and given that Cornishmen do do it directly, as they say in Cornwall, I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has considered the role that the satellites&#151;I believe that there are 18 of them around the coast&#151;of the Marine and Fisheries Agency, which will of course be taken into the MMO, might play as hubs for the sort of interaction he is looking for.</p>

<p class="indent"> The hon. Lady has raised an interesting proposal. The local offices of the MFA are there. They are still part of a Government agency and not necessarily charged with achieving the objective that I am seeking to advance in the amendment. But, yes, that could be considered as a mechanism for consultation and embedding in the communities.</p>
<p>The Local Government Association, which I have consulted about this, supports seeing more in the Bill to reassure local coastal communities. It says that, although the Bill recognises that the MMO needs to build strong and effective relations with local authorities and coastal stakeholders to achieve coastal integration, it lacks detail about how this will happen. The LGA has concerns about the visibility and ownership of the MMO&#146;s activity locally. It would like to see a place for local government on any governance board of the MMO, an alternative model from the one proposed in the amendment&#151;that may answer the hon. Member for East Devon&#146;s point&#151;and local delivery arrangements involved in local government to be in place. I hope that the Minister will reflect on our shared interest to ensure that the MMO retains good standing and respect in the coastal communities that will be affected by its decisions and actions. Unless we do something in the Bill, through the amendment or some other means, I fear that we will create a remote body, which could easily become high-handed, dismissive in its attitude towards the considerations and sensitivities of coastal communities, and inconsiderate of the fact that there is often debate in coastal communities, which needs to be encouraged, aired and resolved. That is an important role for the MMO.</p>
<p>I hope that the Minister understands that this is not an attempt to torpedo or saddle the MMO with further bureaucracy and unwelcome obstacles to achieving its objectives. Rather I am trying to ensure that the MMO retains the respect of the coastal communities it serves and that the Minister recognises that coastal communities and the Government have a shared interest in ensuring that it is seen to serve the interests of coastal communities, can enter into a conversation with them, takes them with it and does not simply retreat into the shell of high office in Newcastle. Many coastal communities are hundreds of miles away from that remote office, which may become high-handed and not serve the purpose the Government want.</p>

<p> I have concerns about amendment 28 and I broadly support amendment 26.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for St. Ives looks on the MMO rather bleakly and seems to suggest it might be about to become the Rural Payments Agency of the seas. That is not how I envisage it, and I hope to reassure coastal communities that that would not be allowed to happen on our watch. I want coastal communities to have confidence in the organisation. There is already provision in the Bill for a range of different methods of consultation and a sense of ownership of the new body, which is to be applauded. We will shortly come on to inshore fisheries and conservation authorities, which will involve members of local authorities as well as interested parties from various industries.</p>

<p> I draw a parallel between the MMO as a quango and other quangos. It is difficult for quangos to integrate and get joined-up working relationships with communities. I have lots of experience of national parks, which have appointed members and some elected members, and they have to work that little bit harder to get productive relationships with local communities. With the amendment, we are saying that the MMO has to demonstrate much more fundamentally that it wants such relationships.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.4.25" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" speakername="Richard Benyon" time="13:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s03.htm#09070267000119" colnum="117">
<p> That clarification was useful. We have to trust the organisation to develop its own brand of leadership. It is a new organisation that will have to go the extra mile to address the concerns of people in coastal communities and beyond. I, like others, receive many letters from people in inland constituencies&#151;about as far from the sea as one can get&#151;who are extremely concerned about our marine environment. Those people need to be heard as well. The organisation will have a national footprint.</p>
<p>When I think of coastal communities, I think particularly of some of those that I have visited in recent weeks, such as Ramsgate and Scarborough. However, if I were to select one, it would be Looe, in Cornwall, which is close to the constituency of the hon. Member for St. Ives. That is a coastal community that is, to an extent, hanging on by its fingertips. It has a viable fishing fleet, an auction house, fish merchants, ship chandlers and repairers, and all the land-based industries that support fishing and tourism. It is an attractive place with a wonderful tourist industry. However, all those interests depend on each other, and on the sea. I have communities such as Looe in mind when I say that I believe that the authority should be required to address the concerns of those many different interests. It is a legitimate social objective to try to protect fragile coastal communities, and no single interest in such a community should exclude the others, as they all depend on each other to some degree. Coastal communities are fundamental to the work of the new organisation, and it has to address them through a variety of means. I have already mentioned IFCAs, but regional advisory councils will still exist&#151;</p>

<p> &#151;as will coastal forums. As we work through to 2012 and the CFP reforms, I hope that we will see a lot more decisions, particularly on fishing, &nbsp;taking place closer to communities. I hope that we can be confident that the organisation will be able to do that. If it does not, that will be a matter for the Secretary of State, the Minister and the leadership of the organisation to address.</p>

<p> Again, we have heard some good contributions. I appreciate the spirit in which the amendments were tabled, which was to try to tease out the exact relationship that the MMO will have with its wider constituency right across the UK&#151;in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, Plymouth, Southampton, Liverpool and so on&#151;and in Brussels and Strasbourg. I understand that there is a lot of focus on the MMO&#146;s location in Tyneside.</p>

<p> Mentioning Tyneside is a bit like a red rag to a bull. The Minister knows that following the bids to host the MMO, there was huge disappointment in Plymouth and also in Cornwall. On Second Reading, I mentioned the possibility, which I have been discussing with the Minister, of an MMO satellite based on the current office of the Marine and Fisheries Agency in Plymouth. There are other such hubs around the country. Now that the chairman of the MMO has been appointed, is the Minister able to give serious consideration to such a proposal, as part&#151;and it will only be part&#151;of making this meaningful to coastal communities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.4.30" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" time="13:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s03.htm#09070267000125" colnum="118">
<p> Indeed. My hon. Friend makes an important contribution to the debate about the way in which the MMO engages and, where possible, develops specialisms. It is good that we have announced the chairman of the MMO today. He is a very dynamic, forceful and charismatic person who wants to see the MMO do its job by reaching right out there. I cannot see this chairman letting the organisation sit in a bunker.</p>
<p>If there are 140 or 150 people within Tyneside, what about the other 100 people? Well, those other 100 people will be right around the country, where the MFA currently has stations. I am glad to say that we are on track with the development of the MMO. The advertisement for the chief executive went out in May. We will now be able to enter discussions about how we augment and build on what is out there, in Plymouth and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I do not want to pre-empt what a chairman or chief executive and their staff might do, or to tell them what to do. However, there is an interesting idea about how we can reach out into communities right across the country. How do we build on the excellent science base in Plymouth and elsewhere? How do we deal with the work that Plymouth has been doing with engagement on coastal partnerships, for example, let alone on marine science? There might well be a way for us to engage right around the country, including in Wales and Northern Ireland, and to bring in existing expertise.</p>

<p> As the shadow Minister for Plymouth, may I add to what the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton has just said? I would be grateful if the Minister could convey to the new chairman of the MMO the very strong feeling in the south-west that we have unfairly lost out and the fact that a lot of these issues will affect us directly. We need some acknowledgement of that and a hub office might be one way to do it.</p>

<p> I have to confess that I am also an assistant regional Minister.</p>
<p>The Minister was talking about the MMO &#147;reaching out&#148;. May I suggest that he looks at the model that we have in Pembrokeshire: the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum? That organisation pulls together all these interests in one forum. The model has worked elsewhere, such as on the Devon and Dorset coasts. If we had a lot more of these coastal forums, they could be the communication point for the MMO.</p>

<p> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Although I understand what the hon. Member for St. Ives is trying to tease out in this debate, one of the advantages of the way in which the Bill is structured is that it gives the flexibility to build on what is on the ground. I know the coastal partnership that my hon. Friend is talking about very well and I know the challenges that it faces. I know that there is a multiplicity of uses of the marine and coastal environment, but the coastal partnership engages with those challenges well and puts its views forward. It looks at where there can be compatible uses of the environment and where some uses must be prohibited, for example. That type of model is not identically replicated around the country; there are many variations on it. Local authorities will have to engage with the MMO, as will national park authorities, and I will come on to how that will happen.</p>
<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for St. Ives on tabling an amendment that is very Welsh indeed, because we love committees in Wales. We love setting committees up because we can debate for hours. We do not actually come to any conclusions, but by God we can debate.</p>
<p>Amendment 26 is very similar to an amendment that was tabled by Lord Greaves and Baroness Miller in the other place. In fact, Lord Greaves said:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;It is very important that the MMO works in close co-operation and, it is hoped, harmony or at least full and frank discussion, with coastal communities.&#148;</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly support those remarks. This is not just an ask for the MMO. It is for all the coastal partnerships, local authorities and others to get stuck in, and the Bill allows them to do that.</p>
<p>At the time, Lord Hunt referred to</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;the vision for coastal management that my department has published recently entitled <span class="italic">A Strategy for Promoting an Integrated Approach to the Management of Coastal Areas in England</span>&#148;&#151;</p>
<p>I recommend that report to the Committee, although I recognise that there are good examples from coastal areas elsewhere. He continued:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The strategy makes it clear that we place a great deal of emphasis on the need to empower coastal communities.&#148;</p>
<p>There is not, therefore, a man-in-Whitehall approach&#151;or even a man or woman-in-Tyneside approach. This is about empowering local communities. Lord Hunt went on to say:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;We want them to have a sense of ownership and stewardship within marine and coastal areas, and we think that that will greatly assist the MMO in the delivery of its functions and the overall objective of making a contribution to sustainable development. We think that marine planning will offer new opportunities for coastal regulators and communities to have a say in the way the marine environment is managed in the same way that they input now into land planning on the coast. Further, the statement of public participation issued by the MMO at the outset of development of each marine plan, which we might debate again, sets out how it intends to involve stakeholders and local communities at each stage. That will ensure that those with an interest will be clear about the process, decide what involvement they want to have and be able to become appropriately involved.&#148;&#151;[<span class="italic">Official Report, House of Lords,</span> 5 May 2009; Vol. 710, c. 465-67.]</p>
<p>As I have said, I am sympathetic to the sentiment behind amendment 26, but I am not convinced of the need to make specific reference to</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;the impact on the lives and livelihoods of the coastal communities affected&#148;</p>
<p>by the MMO and its decisions and functions. The list of facts and matters that the MMO must take into account under clause 2(3) already enables it to take account of socio-economic evidence and such other facts or matters as it considers appropriate, which could and should include any impacts on coastal communities.</p>
<p>I re-emphasise that the MMO will have every incentive to involve coastal communities, particularly when carrying out its marine planning function. Its network of coastal offices, to which I have referred, will assist the MMO to develop relationships with those communities. I see that as an integral role of the MMO. It is not meant to be remote and tucked away in a bunker; it is meant to solicit engagement and work with communities to make things happen.</p>
<p>The marine planning system has been designed for transparency in consultation and processes, and to be open and inclusive. Public involvement in planning is essential to ensure that plans have genuine ownership and reflect the goals and concerns of local communities and those who use areas on the sea. That in turn will give greater strength to the plans. The plans should not be devised on a desk in an office; they need to be developed with communities, because they will then have their support.</p>
<p>On amendment 28, I have already explained how the MMO will discharge its responsibility to engage with local communities. It will, as a matter of course, ensure that local communities affected by the discharge of its functions are fully consulted. However, it would be unnecessarily burdensome to require the MMO, through primary legislation, to appoint a specific committee to &nbsp;ensure that it consults coastal communities affected by the discharge of its duties. I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, but it would lead to committees for committees&#146; sake.</p>
<p>If the MMO decided that such a committee was necessary, however, it would of course be able to appoint one through the provision in paragraph 21 of schedule 1. However, we believe that the decision on the specific type of committee is ultimately a decision for the chair, board and chief executive, rather than something that should be set down in primary legislation.</p>
<p>On that basis, while I understand the sentiment behind the amendments, there are very good reasons to resist them, so I urge the hon. Member for St. Ives not to press them. I have given assurances, and I cannot envisage any way in which the MMO will carry out its business without engaging properly with coastal communities.</p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. To reflect on what the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton said, perhaps I would have been more sanguine if the MMO had been based in Cornwall where, obviously, its officials would have had the benefit of the Cornish air and the Cornish community to guide them in their decision making. I would feel much more relaxed about the possibility of the organisation becoming remote and high-handed if it were operating in that more convivial environment. Those concerns would clearly be dissipated if the organisation were based in Cornwall. Sadly, that was not ultimately the Minister&#146;s choice, but he might have time to reconsider it, perhaps even during our consideration of the Bill.</p>
<p>The Minister said that the written strategy should encourage me, and I shall look at it again. He also referred to the processes involved in marine planning and claimed that they were transparent and that there was local ownership. In reality, the Bill does not bring about a satisfactory level of local ownership. There is a requirement to consult in certain circumstances, but the MMO will be in no way as accountable as national parks, which are at least semi-accountable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said. That accountability does not apply in this case, but one might argue that it applies to IFCAs working within the six-mile zone.</p>

<p> The MMO is rightly being established as an NDPB to give it an independence of mind so it can chart its own way forward but, ultimately, it is directly accountable to the Secretary of State. If it does not discharge its duties appropriately, including with regard to the process of engagement, it will be held accountable, and its accountability is quite direct. I cannot see how it could discharge its duties without that level of consultation.</p>

<p> I am grateful for that response, but accountability to one person&#151;the Secretary of State&#151;does not really address the theme of these probing amendments, which is the lives and livelihoods of coastal communities. The Secretary of State might well come from, or be well integrated with, a coastal community and might well reflect its views, but it is equally likely, if not more likely, that the Secretary of State will not be capable of being sufficiently sensitive. It is important for the Minister to understand that.</p>
<p>When speaking to amendment 26, the Minister referred to clause 2(3) and emphasised that other evidence will be required with regard to socio-economic elements. However, if he had read on, he would have seen that that applied only in relation to sustainable development, so it might not fully take into account the issues that I have raised in this short-ish debate.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Newbury said that we should trust the MMO, but he rather ruined that by saying that that would be under a Conservative Government. I became extremely worried that we might need to add lots more provisions to protect the organisation from the ravages of a future Conservative Government, but let us not go down that route. However, we are not being asked to trust the organisation with regard to engineering, as we discussed earlier debate, so this is like saying, &#147;We&#146;ll trust it on this but we won&#146;t trust it in relation to other factors.&#148;</p>
<p>By and large, I am pleased that the Minister has understood the sentiments behind what I have been trying to explore in these amendments. I caution him to ensure that the organisation embeds itself into the coastal communities as it is rolled out. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton suggested that existing offices of the MFA could be used as a vehicle for that.</p>

<p> Let me make a very short intervention. Marine plan authorities will also be accountable to the courts. Challenge can be brought against an MPS or a marine plan if the complainant feels that the policy of the MPA involves something that it does not have the legal power to do, or if a complainant has been aggrieved by a failure in the policy of the marine plan authority to comply with any procedural requirements. Among those procedural requirements is the necessity to show the process through which there will be proper engagement with the communities before reaching conclusions. That is where the accountability lies. If the body does not do that, it can be hauled up.</p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention, although I have to point to a recent case in my constituency. The fishermen in the village of Helford were trying to build a fisherman&#146;s quay. Properties in Helford are primarily second homes, and the village association got a planning permission that had been granted overturned by a court. Such a course of action was available to those with the necessary wealth, but not to the fishermen pursuing the objective of establishing a safe fishing environment in which to operate.</p>

<p> My hon. Friend raises an interesting local case, but the Minister was talking about developing marine plans. If the process is not followed, I am sure that that could be challenged in the court. Most people will be interested in how the MMO delivers on the plan, the decisions that it takes and how that involves them. We are talking about not dry legal matters, but involvement with communities, which is an organic social thing that is important for developing trust and ensuring that things are done in a way that brings the best out of communities and does not cause them to withdraw from playing their own part.</p>

<p> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention.</p>
<p>I hope that the Minister will reflect on accountability to the Secretary of State and accountability to the court. Less wealthy members of local coastal communities want to be able to articulate their concerns to the MMO, and I am not convinced that either of those points helps with the resolution of that matter. I hope that the Minister will reflect on my concern that if the Bill is implemented as currently drafted, the MMO could easily become a remote, high-handed and out-of-touch organisation that would not command the respect of the coastal communities that need to be on board. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment 30, in schedule 1, page 229, line 19, at end insert&#151;</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="1">&#145;(1A) The report must contain an assessment of whether the MMO has adequate resources and expertise for the carrying out of its functions under section 2.&#146;.</p>
<p>As the Minister will be aware, the MMO will be a crucial lynchpin in the new regime created by the Bill. The renewable energy sector is clearly anxious to ensure that the MMO has the right skills and resources to carry out all its activities, and I hope the Minister will address that in a moment.</p>
<p>The potential for the expansion of offshore renewables, and the creation of a UK industry of some standing, is dependent on the MMO actively delivering Government policy based in another Government Department. The amendment would require the MMO to report annually on the adequacy of its resources.</p>
<p>The MMO will be based on the existing MFA secretariat. The MFA currently has 200 staff. As I understand it, it is proposed that the MMO will have, in total, 250 staff. There will be a wide range of demands placed on the MMO. To a large extent, those demands will consist of new functions additional to those currently carried out by the MFA, which will include planning. In other words, as I understand it, it will be a small increase in the complement of staff, while the MMO will take on a great deal more functions than the existing MFA&#151;quite considerably more, which is the point that I wish to emphasise.</p>
<p>The MMO will have three new roles, which will have a significant impact on the future expansion of the renewable energy sector: it will act as a statutory consultee to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on schemes over 100 MW; it will be the consenting authority in its own right for schemes under 100 MW; and perhaps most significantly of all for the sector, it will prepare the regional marine plans, which will form the basis of offshore spatial planning policy. While the renewables industry welcomed the amendments tabled by the Government on Report in the Lords, which strengthen the MMO&#146;s role in sustainable development, the extended remit requires the MMO to be the management hub at the centre of environmental, social and economic policy for the marine environment. In order to fulfil that role, as well as its wider marine spatial planning functions, the MMO will need to be sufficiently&#151;and very well&#151;resourced. There is deep concern within the sector about whether it will be sufficiently resourced to deal efficiently with the plans brought forward from the industry, which will need them to be dealt with very efficiently indeed.</p>
<p>MMO resourcing is particularly important as the renewables industry understands that none of the energy officials currently working in either the Department of Energy and Climate Change or the MFA will be transferring to the MMO. That gives rise to concern over the experience and knowledge base of the new organisation. Requiring the MMO to report on its own capabilities to Parliament will give us the opportunity to ensure that that concern can be adequately addressed.</p>
<p>I referred earlier to an important project, which we have lost some time on&#151;the wave hub off the north coast of my constituency. From following that project, I know about the MFA&#146;s support for the regional development agency and a number of Government Departments including the Department for Transport, Trinity House and others, which is a complex and involved process. I hope that the Government take on board the fact that this requires a level of resources to ensure that there is no slippage, and that each of the proposals and plans brought forward&#151;whether they are to be supported, turned down, or brought forward with certain conditions&#151;can be dealt with efficiently. I hope that the Minister will take that on board.</p>

<p> The amendment gives the Minister an opportunity to tell the Committee a little more about the structure of the new organisation, particularly at the higher levels. We have heard about the appointment of the chairman, but I do not know what the process was or what skills he will bring to the job. We have not had time to find out much about him, and I look forward to the Minister enlightening us. We also want to know the make-up of the board. We want to be sure that it has a broad range of skills that reflect the demands made on the new organisation.</p>
<p>There is unhappiness among the MFA staff about the degree of consultation on the move to the new headquarters. That is a matter of great concern, as is the lack of incentive for the staff to move. It is crucial to the success of the organisation that as many staff as possible make that move. They are highly skilled and many have years of experience, but they are being required to make a major, life-changing move to a different part of the world&#151;one of which many have no knowledge and with which many have no connection. It is important that their concerns are met.</p>
<p>The credibility of the organisation will be measured largely by its ability to hit the ground running. I am concerned that we do not have the correct number of people in place at this stage. Not enough people have expressed a willingness to move to Tyneside, and we do not know how the organisation will be structured at the highest level or what more can be done to encourage the many people who have contributed to marine and fisheries management over the years to join the new organisation.</p>

<p> I wish to raise my concerns about the resourcing of the MMO and its staffing, and about the Welsh Assembly Government Departments that will take on the responsibilities of the MMO in Welsh waters.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for St. Ives spoke about the consent process for offshore wind, tidal and wave power. My local authority area&#146;s coastline has four projects in various stages of planning or development. There are &nbsp;two wave projects and two tidal projects, and they all pose different problems for the area. I do not say that that will be replicated around the coast, but it gives an indication of the likely level of development that will take place, not only with large offshore wind farms but with a significant number of smaller renewable energy projects, such as tidal and wave power.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the MMO will have sufficient staffing resources, with the right skills, to deal with such a series of applications. The worst thing for the renewables sector is unnecessary delay. It is good to get the consent process working well, ensuring that the environmental impact assessments are completed. The sector understands that, but it is concerned that inadequate staffing resources will lead to unacceptable delays, particularly when dealing with offshore projects. Time is of the essence. Basically, we do not want things being built at sea in the middle of winter, and almost 12 months can be lost if a project is delayed.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, the MMO functions will be dealt with by Welsh Assembly Government Departments in Welsh waters. Is the Minister satisfied that Wales will have sufficient resources? I have cited the four projects already on the drawing board or in various stages of development in my constituency. We should consider what is happening elsewhere in the world, with offshore wind farms and particularly with renewable energy tidal and wave power. I know that the Minister is well aware of the various developments. Will the Welsh Assembly Government have sufficient resource to deal with such projects?</p>
<p>Finally, will the Minister comment on the fact that, although the MMO will act as a one-stop shop for all such developments, as I understand it, depending on the size of a development, the MMO could become involved in some parts of the consenting process, and the Welsh Assembly Government in others?</p>

<p> I want to make a brief contribution and add to the various points made by previous speakers. the Joint Committee on the draft marine Bill raised a point about access to data. The MMO will need to be funded adequately to enable it to access both privately-owned and public date alike. When we made our recommendations, we suggested that it should either be a question of the MMO being adequately resourced or else having free access. As a Member representing a constituency with various scientific organisations collecting data, such as the long-term plankton data recording set, I know that such institutions will not be particularly amenable to giving their data for free. That matter needs drawing to the Minister&#146;s attention. The MMO needs to be adequately resourced in that regard.</p>

<p> Some very good points have been made. First, however, I reiterate that the chairman of the MMO, Chris Parry, whom we appointed today, will be an excellent first chairman; I have no doubt about that. We had a strong field of candidates. Chris Parry has a very strong record in strategic development and management of complex, multi-disciplinary maritime organisations. In fact, it has been difficult to get hold of him over the past few days, because of the work that he has been doing with other countries on marine management. He has a fascinating background. With &nbsp;his agreement&#151;I shall have to clear it with him first&#151;I shall write to all Committee members next week with more background on him.</p>
<p>Members asked about the timetable. The chair designate is now in place, and he will be appointed as chairman after Royal Assent. If the Bill does not receive Royal Assent, of course, the appointment will be terminated, so please keep the good will going! Board recruitment cannot ordinarily commence until after Royal Assent, which is in line with standard Treasury guidance on public expenditure. However, in order to keep things moving, we intend to apply for an advance from the contingency fund. If successful, it will allow early recruitment of the board. So we intend to have a chair and board in place in good time to allow the vesting of the organisation on 1 April 2010.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Newbury asked about the recruitment process. We will use specialist recruitment consultants to undertake parts of the process, including drawing up specifications, executive search advertising, application sift and interviews. Another point was raised about the lack of proper consultation with staff at the MFA. I understand hon. Members&#146; concerns. The move could have been to Carrick, Southampton, Liverpool, Tyneside or Plymouth&#151;the latter was a very favourable location and many were attracted to it. However, we have worked intensively with MFA staff; I, myself, have met them at least twice.</p>
<p>We carried out a staff survey on staff preferences and made staff visits to Tyneside with a series of presentations on Tyneside, the living environment, quality of life and so on. Furthermore, a question and answer facility has been provided on the intranet for staff, and we also held meetings with coastal staff. We always recognised that some staff would not want to come&#151;for family reasons and so on&#151;and we continue to engage with them to ensure that they are properly looked after.</p>

<p> We are looking at two or three possible locations for the site of the building. A number of factors are involved, which I do not want to bore the Committee with. They include the environmental status of the building, which is important in ensuring that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estate keeps its commitment to having buildings of the highest environmental standards. We need to make a decision quite soon. I will return to the other question about the chief executive in a moment, when I have some inspiration.</p>
<p>The MMO will have around 50 more posts than currently and will need to take on additional strength in depth around enforcement, engagement and science. We have already mentioned a chief scientific adviser but it is also about the science base and how it reaches out to other organisations.</p>

<p> On the science, and the debate we had earlier about engineering, what advice will the chief scientist have at his disposal? How will that be organised? Will it be free-standing? Will there be a Committee? How will it work?</p>

<p> The chief scientific adviser will have a panel to work with that reaches outwards from the MMO. Ultimately, the MMO will determine the exact nature of the chief scientific adviser&#146;s role. Lord Hunt said that it would be a very senior role&#151;the fact of the appointment indicates its importance. The MMO chief scientific adviser will not sit in a bunker in Tyneside. He will have to make connections with the marine scientific advisory panel that we have established and that is already extending its work. The panel reaches out to all centres of expertise in the UK, including our own Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science in Lowestoft and elsewhere, Plymouth, Southampton, the Proudman Institute and so on.</p>

<p> We are surprised that the Minister has managed to hang on to a contingency fund that has not been snaffled to pay for one of the Prime Minister&#146;s new initiatives. The Minister has just announced that the MMO will expand on the MFA by recruiting an additional 40 or 50 new posts. Will he give the Committee an indication of the range of pay scales of the new posts and what the additional cost to the taxpayer will be?</p>

<p> No; I do not have that information at my disposal. Ultimately, it will be for the MMO to work within its budget. As we take this forward in Committee and make obligations, for example, to appoint a chief scientific adviser, we are revising as we go to ensure that the MMO has the appropriate resources. When we talk about engineering, we need to ensure that the MMO has a basis of expertise. Let me turn to the other two areas that I did not touch on, which concern statistical analysis and also, crucially, economics and social science. The MMO will be not an MFA-plus, but a very distinct, strengthened organisation. I give an undertaking that the resources will be there.</p>

<p> I think I have made clear that, as the Bill goes through Committee and on Report, there will be finessing of the necessary expertise. It is not only to do with one and half, two, five or ten people working within the MMO. It is also to do with the expertise that they are drawing on externally.</p>

<p> No. We have a body of expertise in the UK within the energy industry, organisations, NGOs and academia that should not be isolated from the MMO; it should be integral to the functionality of the MMO. The MMO is, as it were, the supreme manager and strategist on the marine environment and its success will depend on engagement with other sectors.</p>
<p>Regarding the chief executive, we will be interviewing from an extremely strong and powerful field of chief executive-designate positions next week. Regarding the extra cost for pay, which was mentioned, I can give some indication. We estimate that the additional cost will be about &#163;2.1 million. However, it is up to the &nbsp;chairman and the chief executive to decide the appropriate pay structures and grades for the expertise that they need. It is not for me, as the Minister, to do that; that is what the MMO is all about.</p>
<p>I want to turn directly to the amendment. The members of the Committee will want to know that the Joint Committee of both Houses, which carried out pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill last summer, also raised the issue of staff numbers and expertise. The Joint Committee specifically wanted to see the importance of scientific input reflected in the Bill and that issue was extensively debated in the other place. The Government&#146;s response was as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;We will revisit our analysis of the expected number of additional staff the MMO will require in the light of more detailed understanding of the MMO&#146;s proposed functions and the staff required to deliver them. In particular, in response to the Committee&#146;s comments we need to ensure there will be sufficient scientific expertise within the MMO. In any event, we intend the MMO to evolve, growing into its role - and have provided flexible provisions in the draft Bill to enable this. As and when the MMO takes on further functions, we will review the resources needed to deliver them.&#148;</p>
<p>Members of this Committee will also wish to note that we established an MMO implementation team last year to work with the MFA as it prepares for its transition. Members of that team are currently carrying out a review of staffing and other resources that will be required for the MMO. However, it will of course be up to the MMO board, once it is appointed, to take the final decisions on how the new organisation should be structured and staffed to ensure that it is fit for purpose.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, at launch we expect the MMO to comprise about 250 staff posts in total, which is 50 more than the current number. The MMO will include a range of expertise from the MFA and new staff with appropriate skills will be recruited. A comprehensive training and induction programme is being developed, as well as managed knowledge transfer plans for those staff who are coming from the MFA, the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Transport, as well as for those staff who will not be relocating to Tyneside.</p>
<p>The structure and format of the new body will not just be the MFA remade. The MMO will not only need to plan for new functions to be resourced but to meet the needs of its existing customers, such as aggregate businesses and offshore renewables. It needs to plan for increasing demands, which will involve working with the IPC on major projects to meet the Government&#146;s challenging targets on renewable energy. As I have mentioned, industry also has a role to play in helping accurately to forecast the demands on the MMO, to ensure that it can deliver the service required. So we are listening, and the chairman of the MMO will be listening and making adjustments as appropriate.</p>

<p> Order. Just before the Minister looks for too much more inspiration, I must draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that the amendment is about a &nbsp;report that is yet to be published and whether or not there should be such a report. I think that I have given a fair degree of latitude to allow members of the Committee to tease out answers to some of the questions that they want to ask. I will now draw a halt.</p>

<p> Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Gale. I must say to members of the Committee that amendment 30 is neither appropriate nor necessary. However, I hope that I have reassured them that we understand the importance of ensuring adequate resources. As the MMO evolves and takes on more functions, we will keep the resourcing issue under review, and we will augment resources where necessary.</p>
<p>On that basis, I invite the hon. Member for St. Ives to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.4.66" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" time="14:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s05.htm#09070267000204" colnum="129">
<p> I am grateful to the Minister and to the hon. Members for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire and for Plymouth, Sutton for their comments and contribution to the debate.</p>
<p>The Minister has mounted a defence of the MMO&#146;s capacity to cope with the new demands that will be placed upon it, but the functions transferred from the MFA to the MMO will be augmented simply by a 20 per cent. increase in the staffing complement available, despite the fact that the new organisation is taking on, in my view, a great deal more than 20 per cent. in additional work load.</p>
<p>Although some of the Minister&#146;s words were welcome, I had hoped that he would say more about, for example, the defence of the MMO&#146;s capacity, on which the industries involved will want reassurance. I had also hoped that he would cover the consequences of accepting the amendment&#151;in other words, the problems that would be created for the organisation were it required simply to make a statement within the report to reassure the industry that it had the capacity to fulfil its function, which would not take a great deal of effort. That is all the amendment asks for, so I do not understand for the life of me why it is not acceptable. What would be the consequences of ensuring that the report includes what the renewables industry is concerned about and wants to be reassured about, namely that the MMO has the necessary capacity? That should be included.</p>
<p>Having heard what the Minister has said, and despite the fact that I am not reassured on the matter, I will not push the amendment to a vote. I hope that he will reflect outside the debate on the issues that have been raised, consult the industry and perhaps find other ways to reassure it before coming back on Report and having another go. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p> Clause 2 is a vital part of the Bill; it outlines the general objective of the MMO. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that in exercising its functions the MMO has regard to</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;mitigating, and adapting to, climate change.&#148;</p>
<p>A moment ago, we heard from the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire that there are at least question marks over the ability of the MMO&#146;s proposed staff structure to reflect the demands of relevant technology in this growth industry. Managing climate change mitigation and renewable energy projects will be key to managing the marine environment. As the MMO will be the primary delivery body in the marine area, it needs to be in tune with such issues. As the significance given to climate change in planning decisions on land grows, so it should at sea.</p>
<p>Our seas are important because they absorb significant quantities of carbon dioxide. Regulating our climate is vital and we need a healthy environment. Activities at sea contribute to carbon emissions and limit the sea&#146;s ability to adapt to climate change. The Bill provides an ideal opportunity to enshrine our commitment to tackling climate change through requiring the MMO to take climate change into account when making planning decisions. The inclusion of such considerations in the Climate Change Act 2008 and the Planning Act 2008 set the precedent for Government legislation to have regard to climate change considerations as a matter of &nbsp;course. Given the MMO&#146;s myriad responsibilities in the marine environment, it is particularly important that we place a duty upon it to consider those issues.</p>

<p> If the amendment were passed, the subsections would have to be renumbered, so subsection (4) would become subsection (5). In effect, the amendment that we just voted on, which we discussed on Tuesday, was also to subsection (4), which would become (5). Whatever one might think about the circumstances of that amendment, the outcome would be that an internally inconsistent Bill would go back to the House. The wording in clause 2(4), and that in 44(1)(a) discussed on Tuesday, concerning &#147;furthering&#148; or &#147;contributing to&#148; the achievement of sustainable development, would be inconsistent. One way or the other, such inconsistencies would be likely to be rectified on Report.</p>
<p>In that context, I was pleased by my hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s comments in the clause 1 stand part debate, although they might have been better in a clause 2 stand part debate. Nevertheless, in response to my suggestion that paragraph 7 of schedule 5 might be strengthened to reflect the issue of &#147;furthering&#148; or &#147;contributing to&#148; the achievement of sustainable development, he said:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;I think that is a very good suggestion.&#148; &#151;&#151;[Official Report, Marine and Coastal Access Public Bill Committee, 30 June 2009; c. 18.]</p>
<p>I was encouraged that later the hon. Member for Newbury added:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Will the Minister assure us that he will follow the recommendation made by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test to use paragraph 7 of schedule 5 in order to meet the amendment&#146;s objectives?... If the Minister confirms that that will involve the insertion of words into paragraph 7 of schedule 5, I shall not press the amendment further at this stage&#148;.<span class="italic">&#151;&#151;</span>[<span class="italic">Official Report, Marine and Coastal Access Public Bill Committee, </span>30 June 2009; c. 21.]</p>
<p>Perhaps it was just for procedural reasons that we had a vote a moment ago on an amendment that we discussed, but did not vote on, on Tuesday. Perhaps we voted before we were able to fully clarify where we are with the passage of the Bill. I understand that we now have inconsistency between two parts of the Bill. That is the central issue. My hon. Friend the Minister has now had an opportunity to reflect on what I suggested to the Committee on Tuesday: that an amendment to paragraph 7 of schedule 5 might be an appropriate way to proceed. At that point I did not, of course, have an amendment to hand, nor do we have one before us now&#151;</p>

<p> Order. I have been trying to follow closely what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but amendments to schedule 5, which the Committee has now agreed to, are not relevant to the current debate.

<p> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I will, of course, appreciate, respect and follow your guidance. Before I strayed, I was attempting to establish that the clause is &nbsp;inconsistent with clause 44, which we have previously discussed. It is material that the Committee recognises and understands that, and considers, at least so that it is on the record of our discussions, how to resolve the issue.</p>

<p> To clarify the situation, I thought that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion on Tuesday was a way forward. I thought that what the Committee achieved was better, and I wanted to balance the Bill today. Other legislation, for example the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, puts a duty on community land trusts to further social, economic and environmental interests in local communities. Other legislation seems to be able to introduce such wording, so I do not understand why the Bill cannot. We now have a problem, which we could have resolved a moment ago, but we did not.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Whatever we might think of those circumstances, that is the situation we are now in, and will be in on Report. I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister has reflected on what I said on Tuesday and is willing to consider carefully what wording would reconcile those two positions and make the Bill both internally consistent and consistent with other legislation, notwithstanding the point made by the hon. Member for Newbury. I welcome that, and believe that should we achieve that position by Report, we will not only have rectified the inconsistencies of the Bill, but, on the question of furtherance&#151;</p>

<p> Order. I am dreadfully sorry, but we are in danger of entering the territory of angels on the head of a pin. Let me try to explain again. We have gone past certain stages of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of amendment 1, which was debated on Tuesday as part of a group of other amendments. It is normal practice during the course of a Bill&#146;s passage through Committee to take a group of amendments, debate them and vote on them separately at the appropriate time in the Bill, which, in the case of amendment 1, is now, and we have just voted on it.</p>
<p>Any amendments that are consequential, but need to be tabled in order to reconcile different elements of the Bill if it is out of kilter, must be tabled on Report. We cannot debate them now, because they are not on the amendment paper. The hon. Gentleman has a choice: he can vote against clause 2 stand part if he feels that it is flawed, or he can vote in favour of it and allow the Minister and those working on the Bill to table further amendments on Report. What he cannot do is try to debate something that has already been debated.</p>

<p> I understand and accept your guidance, Mr. Gale. I seek not to reopen the debate, but to place on record what I believe is best for the Bill. I have done that and, following your guidance, I believe that clause 2 should stand part and that subsequent amendments should be made on Report to reconcile the Bill with itself. That was what I was attempting to recommend.</p>

<p> I confirm that my hon. Friend&#146;s interpretation of my earlier comments on what we intend to do is absolutely right. I might be able to help in relation to amendment 3, too. The amendment seeks &nbsp;to require the MMO, in the course of exercising its functions, to have regard to the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change. As those who tabled the amendment might be aware, the issue was raised during Committee in the other place by Lord Greaves and Lord Tyler.</p>
<p>The marine environment plays a vital role in mitigating climate change. I emphasise that the Bill as a whole will help us to meet the challenges of climate change. The Bill will allow us to make better decisions about the activities in our marine area that will help to mitigate climate change&#151;for example, the development of renewable energy projects&#151;and the measures introduced under the Bill will be adaptable to allow us to manage and use new technologies as they come along. Provisions on marine nature conservation and fisheries will also help us to restore and maintain marine ecosystems to ensure that they are resilient to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>I reassure the Committee that climate change will be one of the important factors taken into account in the UK-wide marine policy statement, which will set out, and prioritise where required, the policies and objectives in the UK marine area that will contribute to sustainable development. Climate change is one of the four agreed priorities in the UK sustainable development strategy, &#147;Securing the future&#148;, published in May 2006.</p>
<p>As Lord Hunt said during a debate on the issue during Committee in the other place on 21 January 2009, managing the different pressures on the marine area will be a challenging task, and one that will be tackled through our high-level marine objectives, which were published in April. The objectives set out our interpretation of sustainable development in the marine area and underpin the development of the marine policy statement. The statement, once adopted by the UK Administrations, will provide the framework within which the MMO will operate, and will guide decision making by the MMO and other regulators in the marine area.</p>
<p>In a subsequent Committee sitting, Lord Hunt said:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;In preparing a marine policy statement, we must consider an extremely wide range of issues and policies. The intention is to bring together all policies capable of having an impact on the marine area. This is the first time that that has occurred and, at the end of it, we want a coherent and integrated statement of policy that will make a real contribution to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK marine area&#148;.</p>
<p>Lord Hunt continued:</p>
<p class="indent">To do that, the policy authorities will need to consider a wide range of factors when drawing up the statement, such as the legislative commitments, national policies and targets relating to the marine area covering sectors ranging from fisheries, oil and gas, offshore energy and ports. They will need to consider information and trends on different uses, the resulting pressures and likely changes. They will need to consider how to deal with interactions in uses and what guidance to provide...They will also need to consider the interface between the land and sea and the policy on regional and international interfaces.</p>
<p class="indent">Naturally, some policies feature higher in our consciousness than others at any given time. Mitigation of climate change and security of energy supply are foremost in our minds and they will be two major considerations when the MPS is being prepared. As the noble Lord knows, the Climate Change Act imposes a duty to lay before this House and the other place a programme of policies and proposals that contribute to the achievement of sustainable &nbsp;development and set out how we will respond to the risks facing the UK as a result of climate change. Clearly, those policies and programmes will need to be reflected in our marine policy statement.&#148;&#151;[<span class="italic">Official Report, House of Lords,</span> 28 January 2009; Vol. 707, c. 326-27.]</p>
<p>Rather than imposing a duty on the MMO, therefore, any duties in relation to climate change should, and will, fall on Ministers in their role in drawing up the marine policy statement, which will take account of all relevant policy considerations, including the implications of climate change. Ministers will also be bound by the provisions of the Climate Change Act 2008 and will need to ensure that Government policy achieves the targets it sets out. It is therefore Ministers who must be satisfied that, taken as a whole, the policies contained in the marine policy statement will contribute to the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change and to the achievement of sustainable development.</p>
<p>I hope that this explanation of just how critical climate change is and how we are bound by obligations are reassures hon. Members that climate change is an important issue that will be fully taken into account in the marine policy statement. The MMO must act in accordance with this, so there is no need to make specific reference to it in the MMO&#146;s general objective. To deliver what my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test has suggested, and to give us the time to work on the precise wording, I hope that the Committee will oppose amendment 3, but support clause 2 standing part of the Bill.</p>

<p> The phrase &#147;foremost in mind&#148; may apply, but climate change is not foremost in the Bill. That is an omission, and it does not sit comfortably with other legislation recently passed by this House, such as the Planning Act 2008. We have many more important discussions to come, but there can be no more important issue than climate change. Tempted as I am to press the amendment to a Division, I will withdraw it. However, I look forward to the resolution of the issue raised by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, and I will work with the Minister to try to achieve that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">The effect of this amendment would be that, in certain regulations, references to (or which include a reference to) the Secretary of State would be read, in relation to the exercise of functions anywhere by the MMO, as references to, or as including a reference to, the MMO instead.</span></p>
<p>Clause 7 is supplementary to clauses 4 and 6, which transfer to the MMO the Secretary of State&#146;s functions of granting licences for fishing boats under the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. It follows accordingly that when regulations have been made under the 1967 Act &nbsp;setting out the procedures for granting fishing boat licences, any references to the Secretary of State in those regulations are to be treated as references to the MMO. That is to ensure that the newly-created MMO has all the legal powers to carry out functions previously undertaken by the Secretary of State through the MFA. Clause 7 currently provides for any reference to the Secretary of State in those regulations to be read as references to the MMO, specifically where the MMO exercises functions under the 1967 Act. That is not quite correct, because the point here is the exercise of functions by the MMO, rather than the area where it exercises functions. The MMO may, for example, exercise functions in relation to English fishing boats wherever they may be. This minor and technical amendment accordingly makes it clear that references to the MMO should be specifically linked to the exercise of its functions rather than to geographical areas. I urge the Committee to support the amendment.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment 27, in clause 16, page 11, line 30, at end insert&#151;</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="2">&#145;(f) any coastal local authority;</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="2">(g) the council of the Isles of Scilly.&#146;.</p>
<p>I am sure that the amendment&#146;s purpose is self-evident: to ensure that the eligible bodies that are set out in the Bill are not just Government agencies, as is the case now with the agencies listed in paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1). Harbour authorities are also listed under paragraph (e)&#151;I will come on to them in a moment. Coastal local authorities should also be listed, including the council of the Isles of Scilly&#151;I am pleased to say that the Isles of Scilly are part of my constituency. The council must be specifically named and listed because it is not considered in all legislation as equivalent to other coastal local authorities. By the way, the council of the Isles of Scilly is a unitary authority, and was so before unitary authorities were created.</p>
<p>I listened to what both Ministers said in previous debates in which we attempted to attach a further body to a list of bodies. Perhaps they will refer to subsection (2), which grants the Secretary of State the power to:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;amend subsection (1) so as to...(a) add any body or description of body to the list, or...(b) remove any body&#148;.</p>
<p>With regard to paragraph (a), the Ministers might well say that the Secretary of State could add to that list of eligible bodies coastal local authorities, or indeed named coastal local authorities.</p>
<p>To save time, and in anticipation that a future Secretary of State might be minded to do that by using the provision, the case for including coastal local authorities now is, in fact, very sound. Coastal local authorities should be added to the list of eligible bodies with which the MMO may enter into an agreement so that they are &nbsp;authorised to perform any function of the MMO, because they already undertake a large number of functions that are relevant to the operation of the MMO. There will be a multitudinous interface between coastal local authorities and the MMO.</p>
<p>As I said, the current list of eligible bodies includes harbour authorities. Members such as me with coastline and harbour authorities in their constituencies will know that most of those harbour authorities&#151;most of which will have an Act of Parliament referring to both their functions and powers&#151;are either local authorities themselves, or have local authority representatives on them. Such authorities may also be constituent parts of local authorities when it manages a municipal port.</p>
<p>However, the list in the clause excludes those local authorities that do not manage a port, although they may still have a clear maritime function. I will list some, but not all, of the functions that are relevant to the interface between the role of a coastal local authority and the MMO. The provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, through planning policy formulation and the exercise of development and control as far as the mean low water mark, involve overlaps between local authorities and the MMO. The construction and maintenance of coastal protection installations&#151;sea defences along the coast&#151;involves overlap with the MMO, and certainly with the Environment Agency. A further function is emergency planning powers, which can also involve planning within the marine context, and another is responsibility towards sea fisheries committees, which are already very clear and well-established and also overlap with the future IFCAs set out in the Bill. In addition, overlap is involved in byelaw-making powers relating to the use of the inshore zone, and the management of beaches.</p>
<p>Indeed, those two functions also overlap. A number of byelaws relate to beaches, particularly in the intertidal zone, such as regarding the access of dogs to the coastline, and to beaches&#146; management and use. Kite-surfing is an increasingly popular sport in my area. That sport, jet-skiing and various other activities are affected by byelaws through which local authorities have influence or powers regarding what can be taken on to beaches, and therefore on to coastal waters.</p>
<p>Many local authorities are also involved in economic tourism and development functions, including regeneration of the coastal area. For example, they support the local fishing industry by investing in future market development. That is integral to marine management. Local authorities are also involved in broader issues of community well-being, which can include maritime matters.</p>
<p>Given the recognised interdependence of land and sea environments and the reliance of local communities on both, local authorities have a clear interest in decisions that might affect the health and well-being of those environments and hence the communities that depend on them. Under land use and marine plans, local authorities are responsible for delivering the local development framework in all its constituent parts, including for the intertidal area down to the low water mark. That area is part of the English inshore region, as defined in the Bill, so local authorities are already performing a clear function when considering developments in that part of the marine environment.</p>
<p>The MMO is likely to be the best place to undertake marine planning on a larger scale than many coastal local authorities can manage independently. However, that might not be the case for the inshore area. For example, a marine plan for a complex inshore area with a multiplicity of users may be more effectively dealt with by a local authority or group of local authorities acting together with the MMO. It would be appropriate in those circumstances to incorporate coastal local authorities as eligible bodies, along with the Government quangos listed under clause 16(1). There is also a need to integrate land-use and marine plans with community ownership. It is imperative to ensure that the spatial plans for both the terrestrial and marine environments are consistent in their approach to the shoreline.</p>
<p>There is a genuine concern among many coastal authorities that, if local authorities are not included as eligible bodies in the Bill, the integration that is clearly necessary between terrestrial and maritime planning may become inconsistent over time. Including coastal local authorities would benefit the MMO and what the Government are trying to achieve. Given the expertise available in local authorities, there are clear advantages in delegating to them plans for estuaries and high-use or sensitive areas. It would ensure that the issues were well managed by those closest to them&#151;those who can engage development stakeholders and secure local ownership at a local level. The two plan systems&#151;terrestrial and maritime&#151;could thereby be reconciled. The transparency of decision making and the ability of local communities to influence decisions that affect them are strong reasons for ensuring that local authorities are explicitly included in the manner proposed in the amendment.</p>
<p>Local authorities also have a number of other marine functions. In conjunction with the Environment Agency, they deliver coastal defence functions, and they have expertise in preparing shoreline management plans and in delivering schemes.</p>

<p> The functions that the hon. Gentleman is listing are not functions of the MMO. They are functions that currently exist under statute in respect of the local authority and the Environment Agency. The purpose of the amendment is a delegation by the MMO of its functions to a local authority, so we are discussing something quite different.</p>

<p> I disagree with the Minister. As I understand it, we are talking about the capacity to work with local authorities, not the question of whether the sole purpose is to delegate functions to them. In any case, where it is appropriate for local authorities to take on some functions or to work with the MMO in the delivery of its plan and functions, having that capacity in the Bill would allow the MMO a great deal more flexibility than at present. It would certainly be able to take advantage of the expertise available in many coastal local authorities thanks to the experience and talents in their officer structures. They have expertise in working in many of these areas. Local authorities also exercise powers within the marine environment to mitigate shoreline pollution. That is certainly a maritime role, and the hon. Member for East Devon will know about recent incidents such as those involving MCS Napoli, the Ice &nbsp;Prince and RMS Mulheim, the latter of which ran aground in my constituency at Sennen. Those incidents demonstrate the need for clear knowledge of the marine environment within local authorities.</p>
<p>Local authorities undertake a range of additional functions that are maritime in nature, including the management of beaches and the regeneration of coastal towns. The Government already ask local authorities to engage in the market and coastal towns initiative, which the Government clearly want them to drive forward in their own areas. Local authorities have a general duty towards the sustainable management of the environment under the habitats and birds directives, the water framework directive and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, for example. A key advantage of allowing local authorities to be eligible to work with the MMO, in the same way as the Environment Agency and Natural England, is their public profile and their recognition among coastal communities, as that would bring ownership to marine plans.</p>
<p>I hope that the Minister will reflect on the fact that that in no way undermines the powers of the MMO. Allowing local authorities to be eligible bodies would permit their talents and resources to be employed in the delivery of what the MMO is trying to achieve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-30_MARINE_04-0_2009-07-02a.7.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1987" speakername="Ann McKechin" time="15:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/marine/090702/pm/90702s07.htm#09070267000282" colnum="138">
<p> As I said in my earlier intervention, the clause is about the delegation of powers by the MMO. It is not intended in any way to detract from the need for the closest co-operation with coastal local authorities or from the value of their work, capacity and resources. Nor is it intended to amend any of their numerous existing powers set out in statute or exercised by the Environment Agency. Nothing in the clause, or in the Bill, takes that away.</p>
<p>The amendments are similar to those tabled in the other place, which sought to add any local authority to the list of eligible bodies to which the MMO may delegate functions. Lord Davies of Oldham made it clear at the time that bodies should only be added to the list if it is intended that the MMO will delegate functions to them. It would not be good practice to add additional bodies to that list if we have no intention of delegating powers to them. For that reason, we have included some specific local authorities: those that are members of the new inshore fisheries and conservation authorities; and those that are members of the current sea fisheries committees. We have also included those local authorities that are also harbour authorities&#151;a point mentioned earlier by the hon. Member for St. Ives. We cannot think of anything further that the MMO would need to delegate to other coastal local authorities.</p>
<p>We are of course aware that the main reason why local authorities wish to be added as eligible bodies is that they would like the MMO to delegate marine planning to them. Members of the Committee will note that the designated marine plan authorities for each part of the UK, under part 3 of the Bill, are: the Secretary of State in England, the Scottish Ministers in Scotland, the Welsh Ministers in Wales and the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. Those marine plan authorities may delegate the majority of their marine planning functions to any public body with that public body&#146;s consent. In England, it is the intention of the Secretary of State to ask the MMO to exercise the &nbsp;marine planning function on his behalf, and other arrangements will be made and apply in the other Administrations.</p>
<p>Although the marine planning and marine licensing functions in England will be exercised by the MMO on the Secretary of State&#146;s behalf, the formal responsibility still remains with the Secretary of State. The MMO cannot ask other bodies to exercise the function on its behalf. It may only do so in respect of its own functions&#151;those directly conferred upon it under the Bill or in secondary legislation. We largely expect the MMO to carry out its own functions, but there will be some limited circumstances in which it makes more sense for reasons of specific expertise or geographical remit for it to ask another body to exercise one of its functions on its behalf. That is the context in which the list of bodies in clause 16 was drawn up.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be helpful if I gave members of the Committee a specific example. Natural England, one of the bodies on the list, currently has the power, should it prove necessary, to issue licences to kill or take seals under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970. As the majority of these licences are issued in the marine area it made sense for the function to be transferred to the MMO, and provision has therefore been made for this under clause 9. However, should such a licence need to be issued on the rare occasions when a seal ventures upriver into fresh waters, that would be beyond the MMO&#146;s remit as it does not operate beyond the high water mark. The MMO would therefore need to ask Natural England to exercise this function on its behalf.</p>
<p>Returning now to marine planning, we are of course aware how vital it will be to secure the involvement of coastal local authorities throughout the planning process. Marine plans in coastal areas will overlap slightly with the area of jurisdiction of local authorities, which runs down to low water mark. We believe that this overlap, as well as statutory duties on marine planning authorities to do all that is reasonable to secure compatibility with terrestrial plans, will further encourage integrated working.</p>
<p>We have been working with the Local Government Association&#146;s coastal issues special interest group for some three years now to help us understand the issues associated with local authority involvement. We recently held a marine planning workshop for local authorities in partnership with that group, which had the aim of establishing how best we can provide for local authorities to be fully involved throughout the process from the early stages of development through to monitoring and review. That work is ongoing and we will be running a similar workshop in Leeds later next month.</p>

<p> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that an increase in charges is certainly not the purpose of any part of the remit of the Bill or of the MMO. The idea is to try to make the bureaucracy as slim and effective as possible and to be proportionate. We see the MMO working in partnership with local authorities and all the users of our marine environment, including the private sector. They should be aware that it is there to help further their work, not to hinder them.</p>
<p>We have consistently made it clear that local authority involvement is fundamental to the success of marine planning and its integration with management and planning mechanisms on the coast. The publication &#147;A strategy for promoting an integrated approach to the management of coastal areas in England&#148; briefly explains the range of methods that will enable the integration of marine planning with terrestrial planning at national, regional and local levels.</p>
<p>I hope that this explanation has reassured the Committee. The fact that we have not added coastal local authorities to clause 16 does not mean that the MMO will not be working closely with them. On the contrary, it is essential that the MMO build close and productive working relationships with local authorities as well as local communities, elected representatives, industries, regulators and other interested people in the preparation of each marine plan. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p> The Minister seemed to imply that the MMO would be required always to delegate in every circumstance responsibilities to local authorities. That is clearly not the case. Clause 15(1) states:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The MMO may, with the approval of the Secretary of State, enter into an agreement with an eligible body&#148;.</p>
<p>That is a clear &#147;may&#148;&#151;it is not a requirement. If my amendment were accepted the MMO would not necessarily come under pressure from local authorities to hand over some of its functions and powers to them. Underlying the Minister&#146;s defence is an attempt to create the impression that that is the reality, but that is not in any way likely. I do not see the fear in allowing the amendment to be made. There is no fear at all. In the same way as with a harbour authority or an inshore fisheries and conservation authority, the amendment simply provides the MMO with an opportunity to enter into an agreement with such bodies, with the further check and balance of the approval of the Secretary of State. The agreement would be negotiated between the two parties in advance; the local authority would not be forcing an unwilling MMO to accept the removal of its powers in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>I do not follow the Minister&#146;s logic; she is being unreasonable. The amendment simply gives the Government a further opportunity to demonstrate that they wish to work with coastal communities and not become a remote and rather centralised body, which will always retreat into the powers of the Bill to defend against attack.</p>

<p> I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have included local authorities in the list. To put in additional bodies to which we have no intention of delegating powers would be superfluous and bad legislative practice. That would also unnecessarily raise expectations that at some point there would be such a delegation. If we have no intention of doing that, why would we put it in the Bill?</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument is illogical. I understand where he is coming from, but I hope that my statements today, specifically pointing out that we want to have the closest co-operation with local authorities and a whole range of other organisations that work and operate &nbsp;within the marine environment, have not given the impression that we do not regard close working as utterly key.</p>

<p> That would be true if the amendment were genuinely illogical, because the two bodies that it mentions were in the list. Paragraph (1)(c) refers to</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;any inshore fisheries and conservation authority&#148;,</p>
<p>and paragraph (1)(d) refers to &#147;any local fisheries committee&#148;. Therefore the list covers the sea fisheries committees and the harbour authorities, the boards of which may or may not include local authority representatives. However, the list does not cover all the other aspects and functions that I have described. I will not list them again now, but the Minister will remember them clearly. Local authorities are covered to an extent, but not in all those aspects where their powers are relevant and overlap with those of the MMO.</p>
<p>It would be illogical if I were saying that the Minister must not only accept my amendment but add a further power of duress, which local authorities could place upon the MMO to require them to always accept the removal of its powers. That is clearly not the case. There is a process of negotiation, and the backstop will be the Secretary of State being able to permit, and give the necessary approval for, the agreement&#151;after all, it is an agreement&#151;for such delegation. I am afraid, therefore, that I am unable to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</p>

<p>I hope that amendment 21 will be less controversial&#151;famous last words.</p>
<p>Amendment 21 is a technical amendment that makes an additional provision in relation to agreements concluded between the Secretary of State and the MMO, and between the MMO and the eligible bodies, under clauses 14 and 15. Subsection (4) applies schedule 15 to the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to those bodies exercising functions through an agreement. That schedule relates to the disclosure of information and sets out how confidential information should be handled and the situations where sharing of information between contracting bodies is permitted.</p>
<p>This minor and technical amendment is needed to ensure that schedule 15 to the 1994 Act applies in the way in which we intend. It will ensure that the provisions on disclosure of information will apply where the MMO authorises an eligible body to perform a function under an agreement made under clause 15. It will also ensure that these provisions apply to arrangements made under clause 19(6)(i), where the MMO authorises:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;a committee, sub-committee, member, officer or employee of the body to perform the function on its behalf&#148;</p>

<p> Through this group of amendments, we seek to strengthen the role of the MMO in relation to its interaction with the IPC through making it a statutory &nbsp;adviser to the IPC on developments that impact the marine and coastal environment within the Planning Act 2008 and the Bill.</p>
<p>Members of the Committee will be aware that the Conservatives are no lovers of the IPC, a point which we did our best to make in the debates on the Planning Act 2008. We will probably revisit this issue in the near future. However, we are dealing with a situation in the here and now and therefore we must get it right for the framework of planning, as far as the Bill is concerned and at this time.</p>
<p>It is important that there is explicit accountability within the Planning Act 2008 for advice to be sought from the MMO through the planning process, which is what we seek to achieve in this group of amendments. Our amendments seek to weave the role of the MMO into the 2008 Act, so that it has defined involvement at the key stages of the process of assessing applications for marine and coastal developments.</p>
<p>Part 6 of the 2008 Act deals with deciding applications, and amendment 6 would insert a new section into chapter 1, which centres on the handling of applications by the IPC. The new section would be inserted after section 60, which outlines the provision for the IPC to request a local impact report from local authorities. That is the stage at which an application has been accepted for processing by the IPC and the applicant has sent notice of that to all persons required, including the MMO. That would be the opportune moment for the IPC to request advice from the MMO on the principal issues that may affect the marine environment before making an initial assessment of issues and holding a preliminary meeting with relevant parties under section 88.</p>
<p>The MMO is listed as a recipient of the notice to be issued by the applicant and as an interested person. We believe that its role could be further strengthened, specifically by allowing the IPC to request advice at the beginning of the examination process. That is additional and complimentary to the role of the MMO as a participant in the examination proceedings.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the issue, I was going to offer an explanation, but, while contemplating what I was going to say earlier, I found on my desk a useful briefing document from the RSPB, which is one of the key interested parties. The Minister will note that I did not use the S-word, but if I get through the Committee process without using the lexicon of new Labour, I will have achieved something, so I will use the term &#147;interested parties&#148;.</p>

<p> No&#151;it is another S-word. The RSPB produced a very good briefing on the Bill. On the issue under discussion, it stated:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The RSPB wants the MMO to be a true &#145;marine champion&#146;&#148;&#151;</p>
<p>I underline those words&#151;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;which is fully and equitably engaged with all marine sectors and interests. To this end, we believe that the MMO, as the body with a marine overview and expertise, should have full responsibility for planning and licensing at sea. However, as the IPC will license larger ports and offshore renewable electricity generating stations, our focus is on improving the MMO&#146;s role in determining these &nbsp;applications. We hope the Committee will support our position that the IPC must actively seek, and take account of, advice from the MMO on <span class="italic">all</span> applications for nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs) that take place in or are likely to impact upon the marine environment.&#148;</p>
<p>It is important that those words are put on the record, because they clearly set out our attitude in seeking to strengthen the MMO, as well as our concerns about its relationship with the IPC in the marine environment.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of interested parties, bodies and organisations that get involved in the planning process on land, and the IPC is a new addition to that mix. We have doubts about its democratic accountability, which we believe to be its main problem on land. At sea, the organisation representing the environment and interested parties, such as those involved in fishing interests, tourism and so on, is, has to be, and always should be the MMO. However, sitting over it in some circumstances, alongside it in others, and subjugated to in certain circumstances, is the IPC, sucking power and responsibility from the MMO. We believe that that is wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">Amendment 7 would add material to section 104, to which the panel or council deciding an application must have regard, of the 2008 Act. One of the matters listed is the local impact reports prepared by local authorities. We believe that it would be appropriate to also mention the advice and representations given to the IPC by the MMO, so that it is clear that the IPC must take them into account in making its decision. That is an important part of amendment 7. The amendment uses examples from the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which would allow the MMO&#146;s advice to be considered not only in deciding whether or not to grant consent, but also in deciding what conditions should be attached to that consent. That would be another useful way for the IPC to demonstrate how it had taken the MMO&#146;s advice into account.</p>
<p>Amendment 7 would also add to section 105 of the Planning Act 2008, which relates to decisions made by the Secretary of State and sets out matters to be taken into account when deciding an application. Not all the decisions of the IPC will be made by the panel or the council. Some will fall to the Secretary of State, so the amendment to section 105 would require the Secretary of State to take into account advice and representations from the MMO. The amendment would also add to section 116 of the 2008 Act, which requires the IPC to prepare and publish a statement of reasons for its decisions to grant or refuse a consent.</p>
<p>I apologise to hon. Members for the complexity of this, but when talking to amendments to adjacent legislation, one has to get important points on record. It is appropriate to require a statement of reasons to address how the advice received by the MMO was taken into account by the IPC when making its decision. That provides for the final stage of interaction between the IPC and the MMO&#151;please bear with me&#151;by requiring the IPC to justify to the MMO whether it took its advice on board and how that affected the decision. The Minister is nodding, so I can see that he is with me.</p>
<p>Amendment 8 would introduce the MMO&#146;s role as statutory adviser to the IPC to the Bill. The current wording of clause 25 provides some power for the MMO to advise the IPC on request, but it would be stronger and clearer to provide a specific provision for, and reference to, the IPC. The amendment would provide a general power for the MMO to advise and assist the IPC when required. New clause 1 is a consequential provision to the Planning Act 2008 to bring the MMO&#146;s role as statutory adviser in line with the Bill.</p>

<p> Hon. Members have tabled a range of amendments, with complex interactions, that seek in various ways to require the MMO to advise the IPC on development consents relating to the marine area and to require the decision maker on applications for development consents to take the MMO&#146;s advice into account when making decisions.</p>
<p>Other proposals relating to the IPC-MMO relationship, and similar amendments proposed during the Joint Committee&#146;s scrutiny and on Report in the other place by Lord Taylor of Holbeach and Earl Cathcart, have been debated extensively. Given the importance of the arguments made in support of those amendments, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath undertook to take the matter away to see whether we could come up with alternative amendments that would reflect appropriately the MMO&#146;s role in relation to the IPC.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to the Committee if I start with some background to this complex issue, as I know how important it is for many hon. Members. We are clear that the MMO, as a centre of marine expertise with responsibility for enforcing marine licences, will have a very important role in advising both developers and the IPC on nationally significant infrastructure projects in the marine area, including ports and wind farm developments. The Government brought forward an amendment to the Bill on Third Reading in the other place to reflect that key role, which was welcomed by Earl Cathcart and Lord Greaves.</p>
<p>To reflect properly the MMO&#146;s important role, clause 23 of the Bill now ensures that, through amendments to the Planning Act 2008, the MMO will be involved at three key stages in the Planning Act process. First, at the pre-application stage&#151;under section 42 of the Planning Act 2008&#151;the MMO must be notified when a developer is considering applying to the IPC for consent for any nationally significant infrastructure project that would affect, or be likely to affect, the marine area. That will ensure that the MMO is fully engaged right at the start of the application process. The applicant is also required to submit a consultation report along with the application to the IPC setting out relevant responses and the account taken of any relevant responses. That relates to section 37(3) of the Planning Act 2008.</p>
<p>Secondly, the MMO must be notified when the IPC has accepted an application for examination relating to section 56. Finally, the MMO will be involved as an interested party throughout the IPC&#146;s examination process relating to section 102, thus giving it a key role in advising on any necessary marine licences, which the IPC will deem as part of any consent that it issues. Such licences will be managed and enforced by the MMO, so when new evidence on a particular development comes to light, the MMO will, if necessary, be able to modify licence conditions, add new conditions or even revoke the licence.</p>
<p>Amendment 6 would require the IPC to invite the MMO to submit advice on the anticipated impacts on a marine area of any nationally significant infrastructure development. The amendment would treat the MMO&#146;s advice in a similar way to advice from local authorities, which are invited, under section 60 of the 2008 Act, to submit a local impact report that sets out the authority&#146;s views on the likely impact of a proposed project in its area. Section 60 was added to that Act to give due prominence to democratically elected local councillors who represent local people who will be affected by the proposed project. The MMO does not, despite some people&#146;s wishes, consist of democratically elected members, and neither does it represent specifically a local community, although it will have an important role in marine planning and could, as such, be said to represent the interests of the marine area.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the amendments to the Planning Act that I have just outlined, which we are making through clause 23, already provide for what hon. Members seek. The clause will ensure that the MMO is aware of and can be involved in the examination of any applications to the IPC that are in the marine area. The MMO will, as an interested party, have the opportunity to make appropriate representations to the IPC on those applications, taking into consideration the likely impacts of any proposed development in the marine area. Should the IPC disagree with any of the MMO&#146;s representations, it will have to explain why and give reasons for consenting or not consenting to an application. Simply ignoring the MMO&#146;s representations would leave the IPC&#146;s decisions open to successful legal challenge.</p>
<p>In the other place, we introduced an important amendment that the Secretary of State should give guidance to the MMO on the type of representation that it may make to the IPC. I consider that the kinds of matters that would fall as advice submitted under amendment 6 would be reflected in the content of the MMO&#146;s representation to the IPC on the impact of a proposed development on relevant marine plans and on the relevant part of the UK marine area.</p>
<p>Clause 58 amends the 2008 Act to require the IPC to have regard to the marine policy statement and to relevant marine plans when taking its decisions. There is a further safeguard in that clause 25 enables the MMO to provide advice on any matter relating to any of its functions or its general objective, either on request or on its own initiative, if it considers that appropriate.</p>
<p>I shall move on to amendments 7 and 5, and new clause 1. Amendment 7 would amend the 2008 Act to require the decision maker on development consents under the new regime to take the MMO&#146;s advice into account when deciding whether to grant a consent. It would also require the IPC to include a statement of how it has taken the MMO&#146;s advice into account when giving its reasons for granting or refusing development. New clause 1 would have the same effect as amendment 7.</p>
<p>Amendment 5 is consequential on amendment 7 and would ensure that subsection (1) of the clause, which sets out the subsections that amend the 2008 Act, would refer correctly to all the new subsections that would have been added. As I have already outlined, we made a series of amendments in the other place that give the &nbsp;MMO a clear role, in primary legislation, in the IPC development consent process.</p>
<p>We are resisting the amendments for several reasons. I do not believe that the amendment to section 116 of the 2008 Act would make a material difference to the operation of the IPC. As Lord Hunt explained in the other place, the MMO will be a statutory interested party as part of the IPC&#146;s examination of marine projects. As with advice for any other such party, any advice that the MMO provides to the IPC will be an important part of the IPC&#146;s consideration.</p>
<p>I will now explain why I do not think that amendment 7, which would amend sections 104 and 105 of the 2008 Act, is appropriate<span class="italic">.</span> First, as I explained regarding amendment 6, clause 58(5) of the Bill amends section 104 so that when the IPC takes decisions affecting the marine area, it must also have regard to the marine policy statement and to relevant marine plans. It gives the new marine policy framework its rightful place in the decision-making process. Additionally, the amendment would elevate the MMO above other bodies that are also interested parties to the IPC and have a key advisory role, such as the Environment Agency and Natural England.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned amendment 8. It would impose an absolute obligation on the MMO to give advice to the IPC on nationally significant infrastructure projects. What is the point of imposing an absolute obligation on the MMO to give advice? The obligation is on the applicant for the development to seek the advice of the MMO and the IPC will check that that is done.</p>
<p>I hope that my explanations have reassured the Committee that the positions we now have will be effective, that amendments already made will be effective, and that the MMO will have a full role in the IPC decision-making process. I trust the hon. Gentleman will be content to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p> The amendments in the Lords were very welcome, but I do not believe that the balance in the relationship between the MMO and the IPC is right. I believe that the MMO&#146;s role should be stronger than that of just a statutory consultee. There should be an obligation on the IPC to make a full account of its decisions. The advisory role for the MMO needs to be incorporated into the Bill. Our amendment would put the MMO on very much the same footing under the Planning Act 2008 as a local authority. It is entirely wrong in these circumstances that the MMO has to jostle for position and to be subjugated to the IPC in certain circumstances, particularly in the important area of energy generation. I put on record our wish to continue our approach&#151;looking at the clock, I am not sure whether we should do that now or another time&#151;and to press the amendments.</p>

<p> The procedural situation is that although the amendments were debated together, they have to be taken separately. Two of the further amendments&#151;amendments 6 and 7&#151;relate to clause 23. Amendment 8 relates to clause 25, so that will be taken later anyway, and new clause 1 will be taken at the end of our proceedings on the Bill, when it will be open to the hon. Member for Newbury to move it formally, if he wishes. It will also be open to him to ask for a Division on amendment 8 when we reach clause 25, which we shall not immediately. If he wants to press amendment 6 and/or amendment 7, he will have to do move them separately, formally and now.</p>
