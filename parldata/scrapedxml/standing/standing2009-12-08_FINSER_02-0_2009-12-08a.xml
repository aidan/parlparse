That means that the first evidence session must end at 5.30 pm and the second at 7 pm. I hope that I do not have to interrupt Members or witnesses in mid-sentence, but I will do so if need be.</p>
<p>We will now hear evidence from the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme Ltd and the Financial Ombudsman Service Ltd. I welcome the witnesses to the meeting, and I wonder if you gentlemen would like to introduce yourselves.</p>

<p> This morning we spent quite a lot of time talking about financial stability, and reflected on the fact that under the Banking Act 2009, the Bank of England was given the objective of financial stability. Under the Financial Services Bill, the FSA would be given the same objective. Will either John or Andrew say who they believe is responsible for financial stability? Who would take the lead role?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> I think it will inevitably be a joint enterprise between the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA. Each of us has different levers available to us to take action in support of the financial stability objective. The aim of the Council for Financial Stability is to enable effective co-ordination of the different action by the different authorities.</p>

<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> I absolutely agree with that. The aim of the Council for Financial Stability is to co-ordinate and bring some clarity to the questions that have been asked about the combined roles of the Bank, the FSA and the Treasury. We both prospectively will have an obligation that refers to financial stability. The Bank&#146;s obligation is to contribute to the maintenance of financial stability. With the powers that we have, &#147;contribute to&#148; is what we can do. We cannot, on our own, deliver financial stability. It has to be a co-operative effort, and that is what the council and the co-operation between the FSA, the Bank and the Treasury is intended to achieve.</p>

<p> But is there not a risk that we are no further forward with the new council than when we had the standing committee? In that committee, no one seemed to have formal responsibility for financial stability. Now, it appears that everyone has formal responsibility. How will the new arrangements make it better and more effective?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-12-08_FINSER_02-0_2009-12-08a.1.18" nospeaker="true" time="12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/finser/091208/pm/91208s01.htm#091208118000028" colnum="28">
<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> I think it becomes clearer the more we explain how we can bring our individual powers and contributions to bear. Clearly, the FSA has the actual statutory responsibility for regulating the vast swathe of financial institutions in this country. We are involved in providing liquidity insurance, oversight of payment systems on a statutory basis, and what the Governor has referred to as the funerals&#151;the resolution authority&#151;in the event of a bank failing or coming close to failure. The Treasury in turn has it own powers and responsibilities. I do not think you can say that a single person can bring together all those powers and co-ordinate them, but the council itself can, which is the intention of clause 1.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> May I add to that? We, for our part, recognise that our role in relation to financial stability is, in some senses, a secondary one to the other authorities. If there were to be a disagreement as to what would be needed for financial stability, it is inconceivable that we would wish to second-guess the views of the other authorities in that respect. Our role is to contribute, but not primarily to lead the development of a financial stability strategy.</p>

<p> Whose responsibility is it to lead the development of that strategy? If you are taking a secondary role, is it therefore the Bank or the Treasury?</p>

<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> Each of us is required to produce a strategy. Under the Bill, the FSA is required to produce and deliver a strategy, to agree it with the Treasury and discuss it with the Council for Financial Stability in relation to its financial stability objective. That reflects the powers of the FSA and how the FSA will contribute. The Bank has already been asked under the Banking &nbsp;Act 2009 to deliver, and consulting the Treasury, the court to agree, a strategy for the Bank itself to contribute to financial stability, using its own powers.</p>
<p>All of us have to go through the process, first, to find what we mean by financial stability, which is often a debated subject and which we take to mean ensuring that the financial system contributes effectively and in a consistent and resilient way to the intermediation between savers and borrowers and in markets. We develop policies using our powers to help to ensure that, but contributing is what the Bank can do through its own measures. The co-ordination&#151;overall responsibility&#151;must lie with the council, as it has in the past when people have brought their powers together in the standing committee under the tripartite arrangements.</p>

<p> Most commentators would say that the tripartite committee did not work very effectively. What guarantee is there that the new council will work more effectively, given that you, John, seem to be saying that the Bank makes a contribution and that Andrew is saying that the FSA has a secondary role? I am not clear that we are moving to a better place as a consequence of that in terms of clarifying who actually takes the lead on these matters.</p>

<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> There will be more clarity about how the council works. If it has not already, the Treasury will publish a statement that will constitute its terms of reference and the way in which it operates. There will be transparency about at least some of its proceedings where confidentiality does not get in the way. There will be more accountability in the sense that people will see more of what is happening in the council than was the case in a standing committee, and that brings its own discipline.</p>

<p> There seems to be a surfeit of strategies and a deficit of responsibilities, but we remain to be convinced&#151;we may well be in the fullness of time&#151;about the practicality of the new tripartite. When the Treasury Committee was in Europe last week, we interviewed at least one financial stability committee, which had agreed that the governor of the Central Bank would chair the tripartite. Why do you think that the Chancellor should be the one to be the chair?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> If I may chip in, the obvious reason is that, as we have seen over the past couple of years, the kinds of issues that are at stake in relation to financial stability are ones that affect the economy of the country as a whole, both in terms of the impact on the real economy and the fiscal impact of any rescue package. That overriding stakeholder interest of the Government and the Chancellor is one that fully justifies that role in the tripartite.</p>

However, we are still at the stage of thinking about the kinds of tools that would be used.

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> It is positively helpful that each comes from a different sphere of responsibility and area of interest. We as a regulator have our regulatory responsibilities and, hopefully, insights into how the industry operates. The Bank has its wider economic standing and the Chancellor brings to the picture a sense of the politics of what is acceptable and the intergovernmental side. They have a common interest in the new council in producing the right outcome. Actually, that diversity of opinion and communality of interest ought to provide a good result.</p>

<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> They have different objectives. The Monetary Policy Committee is focused on monetary stability&#151;currently an inflation objective set for it by the Chancellor&#151;and it uses tools, essentially the interest rate tool but more recently quantitative tools, in order to achieve that. The Council for Financial Stability is addressing a completely different question. The objectives are related in the sense that financial instability makes it less easy to manage a monetary policy, but they are different and it would be quite wrong to confuse how the tools were used and the objectives.</p>

<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> They do not work in a silo mentality. The Monetary Policy Committee, after all, has a Treasury observer present on it, and so does the Bank&#146;s financial stability committee. The attention of the Treasury observer is principally, apart from informing the Treasury, to enable the Treasury to inform the Monetary Policy Committee about fiscal policy. When the committee was first formed, there was a question about how fiscal policy and monetary policy were to co-ordinate. Clearly the principals&#151;the Chancellor, the Governor, the chairman of the FSA&#151;are involved in at least two if not three of the different functions: fiscal, monetary and financial stability. The council is bringing together the people who take the decisions across the whole range of monetary and financial policy.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> Thank you for asking that question. I think that you are right that one continuing relationship and role in relation to financial education will be through our involvement in the governance mechanisms for that new body. It is also the case that, inevitably, from time to time we may come across particular issues as a regulator that we think need to be publicly known. For example, a number of years ago we warned about the dangers involved in precipice bonds and it is conceivable that there may still be issues of that kind to which we will want to alert the public directly. I am clear that it is designed to be a single financial education body, just as we are designed to be a single regulator. We will hand over our financial education work lock, stock and barrel to the new body.</p>

<p> Talking to the Financial Ombudsman Services and the FSCS, the FSA has power of appointment and you produce an annual report to it. How much involvement in practice does the FSA have in your day-to-day activities? Presumably, as a quasi-judicial body, the FOS has very little input from the FSA in its day-to-day activities. Does that also apply to the FSCS?</p>

<p> Before going on to some general consumer protection issues, I want to pick up a couple of points on the consumer financial education body. Do you not see a conflict between what the body might want to say about financial dealing and the duties it has in the Bill to maintain stability and confidence in UK financial markets? Does it go into this with its hands tied?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew</span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">Whittaker:</span> That is probably for me to answer. The essence of what people will gain from having an independent body of this kind is confidence in its independence. I expect that there would only be very rare occasions when the advice that it might be inclined to give could threaten financial stability. You might imagine, for example, that if it were worried&#151;as people were a couple of years ago&#151;about the financial position of Northern Rock, it would think twice about advising consumers to pull out their money, because of its obligation to take into account the impact on financial stability. I imagine that that kind of situation would be very rare indeed.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew</span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">Whittaker:</span> I think that success in relation to consumer financial education, as we see it, will inevitably be something that is measurable primarily over longer periods. We did a baseline survey in March 2006 on the financial education position of the community at large at that time. We envisaged that making significant inroads into that could perhaps take a considerable number of years as people gradually became more aware of financial issues. I do not think there is any quick and easy way to measure the success of the body. We envisaged when we did that baseline survey in 2006 that perhaps after five, 10 or 15 years people would do a similar survey and try to get an impression of what had changed against that base line. Certainly, we envisaged it as being something where the real fruits would be measurable only after a period of years.</p>

Those are perhaps secondary measures, but they are in an environment where what we are trying to measure ultimately can only be measured over a relatively long period.

<p><span class="italic">Andrew</span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">Whittaker:</span> There are two sets of provisions on consumer redress in the Bill. One is about collective proceedings, which obviously involve a court-based process, and the other, which I think is the one you are primarily focused on, would involve a quasi-legislative process. This is a process that would be undertaken by rules. There would be a process of public consultation on those rules. We would be bound by the statutory objectives in the Bill in setting those rules. There are also a number of specific requirements about the approach that rules are to take, for example, on the extent to which they need to mirror what the courts would decide. However, inevitably, there will be judgments about the way in which those rules are formulated. I recognise that those judgments will leave some people saying, &#147;I would have got more if you&#146;d taken a different judgment.&#148;</p>

They involve quite a complex process of an assessment by the FSA, a report to the Treasury, and then a parliamentary process. This is a more direct process involving standard rule-making by the FSA. We think that it will be speedier and more flexible than the process that is currently in the legislation.</p>

<p> In section 404(1)(b), it appears that there does not have to be legal action or a court case as a prelude to setting up this consumer redress scheme. How are you going to ensure that any scheme you set up will be free from legal challenge, either by consumer groups or by the industry?</p>

We are required by this legislation to track what we think a court would be likely to decide. It would be possible to have a judicial review by any affected party on the basis that we had misdirected ourselves about what a court would be likely to decide. That will be quite a high hurdle for us to get over, and we will need to do our best to do so.</p>

<p> The recent bank charges case, which involved the Office of Fair Trading rather than the FSA, went through several layers of judicial scrutiny. How can you be sure that the process you go through will be equivalent to, and as robust as, effectively appealing to the highest court in the land?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew</span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">Whittaker:</span> I think that the process we go through will be a different one from that which is used in court proceedings, where interested parties are represented by counsel acting in court, and there are a number of appeal mechanisms. In our case, we would have a legislative process, cost-benefit analysis, formal consultation and the scope for judicial review&#151;a judicial review that could be an appeal. That is different from a court process, and it is potentially contentious. We believe that it offers an alternative method of resolution that could be speedier and more efficient than a court process. It is also worth saying that a process of this kind could be useful after a court decision. If you envisage that the Supreme Court had decided the other way in relation to bank charges, you could still envisage that a process of this kind would be useful as a mechanism for organising the repayment or the redress.</p>

<p><span class="italic">David</span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">Thomas:</span> I am not sure that we see it as responsibility-passing. When FSMA talks about the ombudsman, the language is very much about doing what is appropriate in the circumstances of the individual case, and the whole design of the ombudsman model is based on looking at individual cases. As you will see from our written evidence, more than half the cases that we have dealt with since we were established relate to only six individual products. Deciding those many thousands of cases on a one-by-one basis, without being able to have regard to the more across-the-board economic and strategic issues that a regulator is able to have regard to, is a rather uncomfortable position for the ombudsman to be placed in and, indeed, on occasions we are accused of being a quasi-regulator in consequence of the number of cases we may be deciding in a particular area.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Alex</span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">Kuczynski:</span> The Banking Act 2009, which came into force earlier this year, allows for two options for contributing to the cost of resolution through the FSCS, which can either be at the point of resolution or at the end of the resolution. In the one example that has been dealt with under the new legislation&#151;Dunfermline building society&#151;the arrangements invoked by the notice from the Treasury were for a contribution at the end of the resolution process. Once the Bill&#146;s authority has been resolved, there could be a contribution from FSCS at that point. I am not sure that there is any great change under the proposals in this Bill to that contribution. These proposals deal primarily with the interest attached to those costs, rather than the prospect of the banks and the financial services sector contributing before or at the end of the resolution process.</p>

I imagine that anything to do with the costs of the financial compensation scheme is likely to be a sensitive issue with those who will be paying the costs. However, there is an important safeguard in the legislation, which is that the amount that can be paid by way of the costs of handling a special resolution is limited to the amount that would have been paid if the company concerned had gone into insolvent liquidation and compensation had had to be paid.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew</span><span class="italic"> </span><span class="italic">Whittaker:</span> I would draw a distinction between powers that were needed in a financial crisis and powers that are needed as a result of the more intrusive approach to regulation that we have taken over the past two years. In the course of the financial crisis, those particular enforcement powers were not as significant, because such powers tend to be used after the event rather in the heat of a crisis. The enforcement powers arise out of the determination of the FSA over the past two years to be a more effective supervisor than perhaps it was in the past, and to have a credible deterrent effect on the industry&#146;s conduct. These are part and parcel of that more credible deterrent effect, rather than directly being powers that were needed in the crisis.</p>

<p> Basically, what we now have is a committee with&#151;although you do not like the word &#147;hierarchy&#148;&#151;a clear line of different responsibilities between people, which puts someone in the lead and someone else in a secondary role, but that is not in the Bill. I will move on, but if I may say so, that sounds quite a mess.</p>
<p>Speaking of mess, I would like to come to the issue of powers and responsibilities in this feat. The Governor of the Bank set out, in front of this Committee, the current position on his statutory duties for financial stability. He said that he wanted to be absolutely crystal clear that we in Parliament understood that the Bank of England can do no more than publish reports or make speeches in fulfilment of its duty. He added that if we were content with that, that was fine by him, but what we cannot do would be to turn around afterwards and say, &#147;But you had the statutory responsibility. Why did you not do something?&#148; Is there any power given to the Bank of England in the Bill to try to deal with the Governor&#146;s concern?</p>

<p> I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman that we are talking about a chance set of remarks. They were made quite deliberately to highlight the issues. Whatever the relationship&#151;whether it is a hierarchy or whether there is parity&#151;it needs to be teased out further; it is a complex set-up. Can you summarise for me the key benchmarks by which we could gauge more effective working and success through the Council for Financial Stability? What key things would summarise that for us? Mention was made of openness. What else?</p>

<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> This is a body to co-ordinate, and one measure would be whether we appear, either in normal times or in times of crises, to be co-ordinated and whether we think we are. Another measure is whether we speak with one voice or many voices. You keep hearing us speaking with many voices, even though Andrew and I think that we are speaking more or less with the same one. It is difficult for three people, all giving speeches in evidence, to say exactly the same &nbsp;words, but broadly we should be saying the same things, or approaching things in the same way. Those would be measures of success for a body that is there to co-ordinate, as it says in the Bill.</p>

The members of the tripartite organisation&#151;the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA&#151;have worked very effectively in recent months and years on the asset protection scheme, on recapitalisation and, indeed, on some of the individual company decisions that we have needed to take.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> If I may say so, it is always very difficult to conclude that financial stability has been successfully achieved. Although you may have a long period during which you do not have financial difficulties, concluding that financial stability has been achieved does not necessarily follow from the fact that you do not have problems. Financial stability in essence requires more than a period without difficulties. It requires confidence that mechanisms are in place to deter difficulties. As you do not know all the risks you are mitigating against, you will always need to be chary of anyone who tells you that the system is working as well as it can, and that we have it all sorted. There is always more that can be done. There are always better ways than the ones that we have achieved at the moment.</p>

<p> You have made me a bit happier than the Minister did this morning. I was unsure of where we were, in terms of who was responsible for financial stability and in terms of the role of the Chancellor. It is clear that the Chancellor is chairing the body and will take the decisions but, from what I have heard this afternoon, if you would only admit it, Mr. Footman, the FSA is the body that we shall look to in the future for financial stability. The Bank has a very minor role. It would be better for you to admit that, because if the FSA gets it wrong, you are clear of all the problems. If you continue to sit in a meeting and say, &#147;We are equal partners&#148;, you are an equal partner without responsibility. You can only take the rap, but cannot do anything about things. Am I wrong?</p>

<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> If I may be allowed an observation, one of the lessons of the past two years is that even if we do not do banking supervision, we are still assumed widely to be responsible and are blamed. We have had that in spades at the Bank, 10 years after supervision moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>We are involved in financial stability, there is no question about that. We are involved in providing liquidity, and liquidity insurance, to the banking system through our operations. Those things are not based on statute, but on the operation of our balance sheet. We are also involved with statutory powers in the small ways that I mentioned. All of that we bring to the table in the Council for Financial Stability.</p>
<p>In terms of supervision, when it comes to statutory powers we are very small. Look at the bulk of the legislation and compare it with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which relates to the FSA. However, we have an interest because: financial stability is the environment in which monetary policy operates; our balance sheet is used to provide liquidity insurance to the banking system; and we are involved in payment systems. All that gives us an interest in financial stability&#151;a direct operational interest.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> I would just go back a little bit to clarify what I said. We have an objective relating to financial awareness in legislation that has been in force since 2001. There was a major project set up, which was broader than financial awareness and went into issues of financial education. That was set up within the last few years, but the baseline from which it will work was set in March 2006, rather than back in 2001. So the assessment of what progress is being made will be effectively an assessment from 2006. Going back to what difference have we made, I personally am not best placed to give you details of what we have done, but I would be happy to write to you on that.</p>

You may draw comparisons with climate change. Climate change may be a huge issue, but that does not mean that you should not do what you can to prevent it. I think that, in current circumstances, it is highly important to do all we can to achieve financial stability, even though there may be risks that we face that are very tricky to handle.</p>

<p> But in practical terms, what are you going to do to try to ensure financial stability? Clearly, you need to be able to understand and identify the risk inherent in the financial instruments with which banks are trading. That is what caused the current financial crisis. It is no good saying, &#147;Well, when we have another Northern Rock we&#146;ll do things differently&#148;, because Northern Rock was the fever that presaged the plague. By the time Northern Rock had gone, it was too late&#151;the chain reaction had started. What are you going to do differently to ensure that we do not have financial institutions taking on huge amounts of risk that you do not, or did not, understand, and that they clearly did not understand?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> To answer that, it is important to start with the causes of the financial crisis. The causes of the financial crisis&#151;extensively and, in my view, very convincingly set out in the Turner report&#151;are not simply about individual misconduct or mismanagement in particular institutions. They are also about huge economic forces, and particularly financial imbalances between the west and China. Those have caused China, as a nation of savers, and the US, in particular, as a nation of borrowers, to create financial dynamics that eventually proved to be highly destructive. That is, if I may say so, an important illustration of why it is important that financial regulation does not just look at micro-prudential issues and individual issues within firms, but also looks at the wider economic environment, taking into account the kind of contribution that the Bank of England must make.</p>
<p>I would be very happy to accept also that there is a very significant role for regulation, but, in the past, as we have said in relation specifically to Northern Rock, regulation was not done as effectively as it could have been. A huge amount of work has been done since the internal audit report we published on our supervision of Northern Rock, in order to strengthen the way in which supervision is conducted. We have taken on more than 100 additional supervisors over the past year or so. We have reorganised supervision and have put in place major training arrangements. We have started to interview, for the first time, senior people who are being appointed to the boards of institutions, and we have done a huge amount of work on governance. We have started being more intensive and intrusive in our approach to supervision, by starting to challenge business models, and by looking at where the money is coming from within individual firms and what their exposures are. I am conscious that I have answered very comprehensively, but I want to emphasise that we accept that supervision was not done effectively, and that we are doing a lot to improve it.</p>

<p> To be fair, many economists were saying that there was an enormous trade imbalance between China and America, and that there probably were no acts of misconduct. We must not allow ourselves to think that these bankers were doing anything illegal. &nbsp;They were creating hugely complex, highly leveraged financial instruments, and failed to price risk. They did not understand what was being traded, and neither did the FSA. Surely, in future we need to understand how risk is being priced within major financial institutions. It is not a question of misconduct. If there is misconduct, you lock people up, of course; that is a failure of a firm&#146;s compliance department. But the issue is all about not understanding where risk lies within financial institutions and the economy. How are you going to ensure that banks explain to you exactly what they are doing?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> Just to pick up on that last point, I think it is both about getting banks to explain the way their business models work and the vulnerability of those models, and also, at the highest level, about looking at risks in the wider environment. In the FSA&#151;in the Bank as well&#151;we have assessments of risks, and the one that we have discussed today is only one. Any of those risks could be hugely problematic if it were to emerge. The key thing, as you rightly say, is to be able to understand the risks and to translate that understanding of a risk into an understanding of how that risk might emerge in an individual institution, and then to try to take action to prevent it from doing so.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> Potentially, yes. That primarily tends to be done not through a &#147;bank examiner&#148; model of the kind that has been used in the US&#151;often with a resident supervisor in an individual banking institution&#151;but by a focus on analysis, with the senior management, of the issues in the organisation.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> That is a fair question. As with everyone else, inevitably our body has to be choosy about how it uses its resources. The choice we have made at the moment is that we should focus on the institutions that have the highest potential impact, so we are looking particularly at the largest banks and insurers. I think that members of the Committee would agree that it is sensible in any environment of risk or constraint to try to focus resource where the risk seems to be largest. No jurisdiction could sensibly invest the money that would be needed to have a regulator at the shoulder of everyone doing every transaction. What is needed is a smarter approach, in which you try to look at the strategic issues and the business model and its vulnerabilities. When you identify those, you should be ready to be firm in indicating the problems that you see and in trying to stop them.</p>

<p> Mr. Thomas, do you think that in the Bill, it might have been a good idea to bring together the current credit control, or consumer credit, aspects of the OFT into something more co-ordinated?

<p><span class="italic">David Thomas:</span> We have a close working relationship with both the FSA and the OFT, and that issue has not caused us any practical problem at all in dealing with cases in both those areas, or with bodies that are regulated in both those areas. However, the recent Supreme Court judgment talked about looking at the pricing of a current account&#151;whether it was in credit, in debit, or varied between the two&#151;as a single package. That obviously raises some interesting questions about the future shape of regulation, but those are matters of policy, which I do not think are for an ombudsman to comment on.</p>

Obviously, the financial stability committee reviews the analytical material that comes out of the financial stability area of the Bank, which itself is to be reviewed by the Council for Financial Stability. So the FSC will be conscious of the &nbsp;interest of the co-ordinating body, but operationally, no, the Bill does not have any implications, because the FSC monitors the Bank&#146;s use of its resolution and payment systems oversight powers, it looks at the Bank&#146;s regulation of Scottish and Northern Irish note issues, and it recommends the Bank&#146;s financial stability strategy, within the powers that it has.

<p> May I ask Mr. Whittaker a couple of questions about some of the powers that the FSA is getting under the Bill, and the new regulations to prohibit or require disclosure of short selling? You had what some would argue was quite a restrictive regime in place early in the financial crisis. What was wrong with the legal basis of those powers that requires a different set of powers now?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> Thank you for asking that question. As you will know, the powers that we used last autumn required us to characterise short selling as market abuse. Those powers are currently subject to a sunset clause and are potentially going to be affected by a European directive. The Bill enables us to ban short selling without having to categorise it as market abuse. It therefore enables it to be done without being impacted by any changes in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> Yes. I should start by saying that we are happy with the powers proposed in the legislation. We have an existing code of conduct in relation to remuneration. It focuses on methods of remuneration, to ensure that those that are used are not ones that promote risk. The new legislation would provide an additional backing to that kind of code&#151;specifically, if it were incorporated in the form of rules&#151;that would enable provisions that we had bound by rules then to be ineffective. It would not be a retrospective effect. It would apply after the date on which the rules come in to contracts that are made after that date. We do not see any virtue in retrospection. Indeed, we see a positive virtue in provisions encouraging people to formulate their contracts in a way that complies with the code&#151;that complies with the rules.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> Yes. In that situation, it is conceivable that there would be other action that we would want to take. We might, for example, be concerned about the exposures that would result to the firm from that contract of employment. Therefore, we might ask for additional supervision of a trader who was incentivised in a way that we believed was dangerous, but the effect of this clause would not be to make that an unlawful term.</p>

<p> I want to pick up Mr. Footman on the concerns that he touched on in response to Mr. Tyrie&#146;s questioning. You referred to the concerns that a bank has about the resolution and recovery plans set out in the Bill. Would you elaborate on those a little?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-12-08_FINSER_02-0_2009-12-08a.1.289" nospeaker="true" time="12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/finser/091208/pm/91208s06.htm#091208118000226" colnum="48">
<p><span class="italic">John Footman:</span> Yes. This is a point that I referred to in the short paragraph that I sent to the Committee earlier. Developing living wills, as they are colloquially called, is one of the priorities for both the regulators and for the resolution authorities, and in this case we are the resolution authority. Recovery plans are for banks that have got into difficulties but are being helped, managed or overseen out of it by the regulator. Resolution plans are for the resolution authority, which will need to have a very strong base of information at very short notice that tells it about the possibilities that exist for resolving a bank&#146;s affairs; the constraints that may exist as a result of the bank&#146;s structures, domestically and abroad; the kind of loan books that it has; the sort of risks that it is running; and particularly the way in which its balance sheet is structured. That is a mass of information that the resolution authority needs.</p>
<p>Our slight discomfort with the Bill is because the process of collecting all the information is entirely with the FSA. With the best will in the world, operating through someone else to get something that you need is less efficient than trying to do it directly. For that reason, at various points we have asked for the bank to have a direct power to get information from the financial institutions, consistent with the statutory powers that it has. More widely, you can see that in the Bank of England Act 1998 we have a power to get monetary statistics from the banks. The FSA obviously has powers to get information from the banks. In the Banking Act 2009, under the payment system oversight, we have a power to get information from payment system operators. We have another power to get information from the Scottish and Northern Irish banks in relation to our regulation of their activities.</p>
<p>On the special resolution authority role, we do not have an information power, and we would like to have one directly. We would find it more productive and helpful to do so. That is not to say that we cannot work with the FSA. At the moment, we are working with the FSA across a small number of firms on resolution plan piloting, which is starting now and running into the first quarter of next year. That is happening, but our preference&#151;we have expressed this to the Treasury and I think people here know about it&#151;would be to have a direct power to get information from banks, or to have an ability to insist that the FSA get it for us rather than have to ask for it. Obviously, the FSA has its own constraints on asking for information from banks&#151;Andrew &nbsp;can explain this&#151;because there are regulatory codes that it has to comply with when it asks for information, and the fact that the Bank of England wants it is not always a compelling reason for getting it. If we had the power, the fact that the Bank of England wanted it would be an overwhelming reason for getting it, and that is the concern that lies at the background of what I say.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Andrew Whittaker:</span> John has put our concern very well. The process of ensuring that a bank is stable and able to be rescued and recovered is part and parcel of what a regulator needs to do, so we think that it would be a confusion of responsibilities and accountabilities if the bank were to have a direct power that enabled it to start going into that. However, just to provide some reassurance on the second concern that John raised, I believe that the fact that the Bank wanted information about a living will would be a perfectly good and sufficient reason for us to obtain that information. The Bank is the clear stakeholder on the preparation of a resolution plan because it is the resolution authority.</p>

<p> May I ask you all about the new collective proceedings powers set out in the Bill? Is the fact that we are relying on consumers to act collectively to enforce rights&#151;if they have them&#151;in financial services, which is the one of the most heavily regulated sectors in the UK economy, a sign that regulation has failed? I just get a sense that someone is not doing their job properly, and is relying on the courts and on consumers to do the job on their behalf. Is it a sign of regulatory failure?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Vicary-Smith:</span> It is certainly the case that the regulator is not doing its job, as we can see from the evidence on payment protection insurance and the persistent mis-selling and lack of action. It created a situation where the Financial Ombudsman Service was overwhelmed by claims, of which some 89 per cent., I think, have been upheld. It is undoubtedly the case that there are problems.</p>
<p>The FSA is trying to tackle the issue, but the regulatory process takes too long to address a number of such problems, which is why we are supportive of the measures on collective redress. It would enable consumers to get their entitlement to funds. After all, to be in the process, a firm has to have broken the law, and action needs to be taken to address that. The case has already been proven against it, and the question now is whether it is going to be relieved of its ill-gotten gains, and either return the money to consumers directly, or return it in some other way that ensures distribution under consumer protection measures.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Vass:</span> I think that there have been failures in the past, but we see it as a package of redress measures, which, taken together, are extremely important. We particularly welcome the proposal for collective proceedings with an opt-out procedure, which will redress a great imbalance for older people, who often are not in a position to make a complaint themselves if they are socially isolated, if they do not have support, if they are immobile, or if they just do not have access to the available forms of information. We therefore strongly support those aspects of the Bill.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> I think that the strengthening of section 404 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which is proposed in the Bill, will make it somewhat easier for the FSA to intervene. I would hope that the availability of this option would encourage them to do just that. As Peter says, however, the ability for an organisation or individual to take collective action or set up a collective action in respect of payment protection insurance, for example, which seems to be drifting on, would be a useful power to make available to consumers.</p>

<p> Adam, you are chairman of the Financial Services Consumer Panel, and the Financial Services Bill seems to cover a wide range of topics.

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> I think that the FSA has changed its behaviour in the last year. There has been a restructuring and a couple of people who have more of a consumerist background have joined the board: that can only be encouraging. The FSA is clearly more willing to take enforcement action. The real issue here is to ensure that the leadership in the FSA takes its consumer protection objectives seriously and that it has the tools to do the job. In some cases, we see in this Bill proposed changes that will give it more certainty against legal challenge.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> I think we would like an opt-out. The way in which the legislation is drafted gives the courts the power to decide. In most cases, we would prefer &nbsp;opt-out, so we do not have to marshal and herd potential claimants in. But it seemed to us that the legislation had taken that into account, so it was not such a hot point for us.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Vicary-Smith:</span> One of the reasons for our much preferring opt-out is that, after all, we are one of the few bodies, and perhaps the only body, that has actually taken action under this, with JJB Sports. Our experience of that process has affected our views on the best mechanism. We found that, despite quite a lot of media attention, it is difficult trying to get people, when you are at the end of the process of regulatory enforcement, to remember that they bought a football shirt several years ago, that they had a receipt showing they paid for it at the time, and to be bothered to do anything about it.</p>
<p>That means that it is incredibly difficult, if it is opt-in, to get people involved. We ended up with fewer than 1,000 people claiming, out of the many hundreds of thousands who had been mis-sold in that instance. So we think that the danger is that, if you do not have opt-out, you will just have continued weak take-up, and it will not be a deterrent to firms from taking this action. After all, it is about ensuring that firms are discouraged from illegal activity because they know that they will not get away with it&#151;and if they do not get away with it, they will have to reimburse or pay into some other fund. So the deterrent is really important. Opt-in does not offer that deterrent.</p>

<p> May I turn to the financial education body that is being set up?

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span><span class="italic"> </span>I think that the FSA has done a good job of piloting a financial education and capability process; there was nothing before it started doing it. I agree that it has tended to over-claim its successes, but the individual pilots have been quite successful in terms of the behaviour changes they have observed. The panel is enthusiastic about this development. We think this is a good development that will provide a useful way of getting consumers to engage with the industry and to encourage them to save and to take out protection that they might otherwise not be doing. We see falling take-up of things such as protection at the moment.</p>
<p>We believe that for it to be effective it now has to be separated from the regulator. There is a potential conflict of interest between the regulator&#146;s role in terms of working with the industry to make it effective in the way it delivers consumer protection but also protects the system, and an education body that has to represent the consumer and go potentially beyond what is within the proposed Act. As an example, I would like to see consumer education bodies writing documents that say things like, &#147;A good bank will reply to a complaint within two weeks, but within the law it has to do it within eight weeks.&#148; The FSA would say that eight weeks meets the requirement and anything more is unnecessary.</p>

<p> Which may indeed involve making quite robust statements about the quality of various services, which could in theory have some bearing on that broader financial stability. What about the Government&#146;s model of the people who are on this new body being appointed by the FSA? It is not very clear who they might be or from what pool they might be drawn. I attempted to get the FSA to say a little bit more about whom they might be looking for to occupy these roles and got about as dead a bat as could be manufactured.

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> There are two things to say. First, the board of the Financial Ombudsman Service is appointed by the FSA and it has exhibited considerable independence. I think it is a matter of the people you have rather than necessarily the appointment process. There are undoubtedly some very good people with consumer experience around. One would like to see the leadership coming from that sort of person. One of the issues for the FSA&#146;s board is that it has been dominated by people who work within the financial services industry.</p>

<p> Yes, but there is another part of this, which is the word &#147;education&#148;. The material I have observed from the FSA delivered direct or through personal finance education on its behalf in the education field does not stand the test of mass pedagogic engagement. In other words, just getting people to use them as educational tools is way beyond them. They are materials best suited to reasonably well set up, well established and highly motivated people rather than for bulk activity. Would it not be useful to have people who have some genuine experience of delivering this as a service, perhaps to the unwilling, certainly the ignorant, rather than some idealised consumer?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> The Citizens Advice service has built up a lot of experience of doing exactly that, of using materials produced by the FSA and others and delivering them to people who need them. Our strategy for financial education is based on lower-income adults in households where we often find people who are subject to bad practice and being ripped off by financial services, and who need a lot of help to understand financial products and services and even basic skills such as budgeting. For example, we have a strategy of 14 regional financial capability forums, which bring together about 700 different organisations, so we are acting as a conduit between those materials and front-line workers in places such as housing offices and various different organisations. The strategy is not just about providing materials, but about how you provide an interface on the ground with people &nbsp;as consumers, as well as with people who consumers go to for help and advice. We reckon that we have managed to reach about 200,000 people a year by doing that.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right that to concentrate on education is the wrong thing. I think that we need to ensure that a new body has a strategic view and is able to build on what we already have. We hope that that will provide a step change in the kind of services&#151;advice, not just information, services&#151;on things that can help people understand it, and advice and information services where people can be talked and helped through decision making.</p>

<p> May I give a concrete example? The FSA distributes a great tome on financial products to expectant mothers and seeks to educate them on that.

From your positive remarks, you presumably hold such products in higher esteem than I do.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> I think that the point here is that what is important with a new mother is whether they are getting the benefits they are entitled to and whether there are other needs for financial products and so on. We try to provide a holistic service. Producing good materials can help; they can be a tool for our advisers to work through with someone&#151;it saves us having to print them&#151;about all the things they need to think about and the things they might be able to do to help us. I think that you are right: all printed materials need to be proofed to make sure that they work, are understandable and so on. But the key thing is how they work with advice services for those who need help to interpret them, in which case they can be useful.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Vass:</span> I happen to have met with money guides from Age Concern in the north-east and north-west of England today. The numbers that we have reached so far have been much smaller and in the thousands. But looking at the impact, as opposed to reach, on individuals, the sorts of face-to-face advice service that they have &nbsp;been able to offer has been extremely encouraging. Not only are people coming in when a threatening life event happens, but there are also indications that people are now starting to be reached in a proactive way. For example, older people who would not have previously thought about it are now starting to be encouraged to look at the financial products on offer, perhaps notice that all those products are with one provider, and are given the confidence and knowledge to shop around. That is the absolutely essential service that I think the new financial education body will need to offer.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> I think credit card cheques are a problem. You need to locate them generally in the whole question of credit cards and their relationship to debt. We deal with about 1.9 million debt problems a year. Credit cards have for a long time been the single biggest problem area of debt that we deal with. There are about 300,000 to 350,000 different credit card debts every year. We see cases of people with really bad multiple debt problems&#151;&#163;100,000 spread over 20 products. Credit cards are always a big part of that multiple credit card use. So there is a pattern.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> I am coming to cheques. Credit card cheques are part of a pattern of credit card practices which are unhelpful and harmful in some cases to consumers. The specific things about credit card cheques are that there is some evidence from research to suggest that they are linked to over-indebtedness. They tend to be larger transactions. We have seen some cases where people in financial difficulty have resorted to using credit card cheques to help them try to make ends meet, which has made their debt problem worse. They tend to be more expensive. They are often charged as cash transactions with other levies. They do not contain the same sort of protection as section 75 protection. The other big issue is the unsolicited issue. So these measures are not trying to ban credit card cheques per se. What we and other consumer groups have called for is an end to their unsolicited issue. If consumers find them useful, they can ask for them. The problem is when they are sent to consumers and they have a damaging effect. That should stop.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Vicary-Smith:</span> I would agree entirely with that. Let us not pretend that there is great consumer demand. In 2008, 292 million were sent out and only 0.9 per cent. were then used. Most of us are sent these cheques and then there is the fraud risk and all the rest of it. They are a product in search of a market. They are only one part of the problem of irresponsible lending. We welcome that move. We were very disappointed that there has not been a move on unsolicited credit limit increases, for example. Although at a public event last summer the Prime Minister committed to banning unsolicited credit card cheques and unsolicited credit card increases, that has not come through. We think that is a similar serious problem, because in my own experience and the experience of everyone I talk to, these limit increases are not used primarily as a way of getting people used to credit and extending it through. They are given to you when you are in debt. They are not given to you until you are near your credit limit and then they are given to tempt people into further debt. We would like to see those go on an unsolicited basis as well. One of the things we are calling for in the passage of this Bill is to ask each of the Front Benches to make it clear that they will take action against unsolicited credit increases as well. At the moment the industry has no incentive to come to the table. If all parties indicate that they will deal with this problem, the industry will have to come to the table and tackle it itself.</p>

Moving it all into one place is not a simple question of picking up credit from the OFT and plopping it into the FSMA. They are very different regimes. Both of them have their strong points and their weaknesses. If you did that, consumers would lose some powerful protections under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.</p>
<p>If that comes to pass and there seems to be a growing consensus on putting everything in one place, we would say, again, that we are quite agnostic as to where it goes. We would say that the OFT has a lot of experience in consumer credit, the relationship to trading standards and the long tail of credit that you would have to think about. Aside from that, I would not discount its expertise and its growing use of its powers under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 to bring to book some bad traders who have caused consumer detriment. As well, you need to think about that rather than just moving it in the Bill. We would not want to lose some of the provisions such as the unfair credit relationships test, the time orders and things such as the early settlement discount.</p>

You would not be able to mobilise it in quite the same way. It is a regulatory principle rather than a necessary consumer redress principle.

<p> I want to return to financial education. I agree wholeheartedly with Mark: the acid test is about, &#147;So what&#148;? Product, yes, quantitative measures, yes, but surely it is about process and qualitative measures. Improving financial education is not only laudable, it is an imperative, but there are no magic bullets or quick fixes. Are you aware of any notional or national targets, or any benchmarks for improvement over a time scale? Would you not agree that it is vital that we know how we might measure success and, en route, how we might monitor progress towards that success?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> As far as I am aware, targets and benchmarks have not been set. The FSA is on record as saying that it proposes to repeat its financial capabilities study, but that it does not expect to produce a significant change quickly. That suggests that they reasonably do not expect to see much next time around. If you look at the sort of changes that we would like to see, there are really two components. The first component concerns what is happening to defined benefit pension schemes and with the rather alarming drop off in protection&#151;life insurance and other kinds of insurance. A very quick fix has to be put in place to encourage people to start saving more and to protect themselves better. The longer term is definitely educational and is about producing a generational shift in how people behave. Both of those things have to be done, but we should set the new education body some aggressive targets to change behaviour. If that body does not achieve those targets, we will have to look and see why.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Vass:</span> May I pick one particular area in which&#151;if one takes Adam&#146;s approach to be the sensible one&#151;you could actually measure progress? It would be to look at annuities and how people shop around for them on retirement, which I understand from Age Concern&#146;s money guides today, is actually proving to be quite an issue for people with low incomes, who are drawing small pension funds on retirement. That is an area where it is possible to track the numbers shopping around and buying elsewhere. Of course, it is difficult to tell what the right answer is. Some people who shopped around might have been better off staying with their existing provider. However, if one looks at market activity in that sort of way, and also in regard to consumer education and guidance&#151;there is a spectrum of need there&#151;you can start to create a virtuous circle. It is not just about explaining the industry to consumers, but consumers, through this mechanism&#151;through the education body&#151;feeding back to the industry about broader issues. The education body would not see them as the voice of the consumer, but we think that they should have a specific ability, in the Bill, to be able to make public statements.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> The other thing is that we are not necessarily starting from scratch. I said earlier that the CAB service has been doing various bits of financial education work for quite a long time and we have those pieces of work evaluated&#151;we get external valuation. For instance, we were involved in the OFT Save Xmas campaign and that was evaluated. Nearly 40 per cent. of &nbsp;the people participating had positive changes in their savings decisions. Various other projects have gone back some time after they have had some education done to them, as it were&#151;participating in a project&#151;and asked people how that has changed how they made decisions about savings and financial products, and you can show some improvements.</p>
<p>A lot of the work that we do at the moment is funded by the private sector. To get that money, we need to be able to demonstrate outcomes; we need to demonstrate exactly what you are arguing&#151;that there is an effect. The new body should look at how people have evaluated things, the idea of having a strategic vision of what it is trying to achieve, but that being based on some of the things that already exist. There is evaluation work going on. We have a number of projects that have had, or have, ongoing evaluation. A lot of the work going on on the ground will now have that evaluation. That is something that the body needs to take on.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> I would just like to add to that. The FSA has, as we have heard, involved a number of bodies already delivering advice to consumers. If that is going to be effective, it should act as the lead body for all sorts of advice, so that there is some co-ordination and they work together. I am thinking particularly about pensions. For this body not to be able to give advice on pensions would be a considerable failure, because most people see that one of the key things to save for is their pension, so it should be a one-stop shop.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Vicary-Smith:</span> Helping people to understand what they are buying has two dimensions. One is about educating people, so that they know what they are getting, and shopping around and all the rest of it. The other end of the funnel is about simplifying the products and making them more transparent. I am always reminded of the fact that in the days when we had VCRs, none of us could ever programme the VCR. That was not solved by teaching us how to programme VCRs&#151;it was solved by the industry developing products that did not need to be programmed. It strikes me that there is much more that needs to be done by the industry to simplify its products and to identify real competitive edges, rather than identifying a number of features that differentiate products but are not truly different, and competitive benefits. The industry needs products that consumers with a comparatively low degree of further education can understand. If we are asking people to understand the products that are widely sold out there when we are into many years and generations of education, more can be done from the other end by the industry.</p>

<p> May I pursue that point? I asked the FSA what success looks like for the consumer financial education body, and I received a rather woolly answer; there was nothing precise there. I want to put essentially the same question to you. The problem that I have, of course, is that it is very easy to try to measure that success in targets that lead to output-generated measures. What we are trying to achieve is outcome-generated measures and outcome changes. Can you try to put that in a broader context to show how you will get that agreement between you, as a focus and a pressure on the new education body so that it achieves real outcomes?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> I am trying to think about this. I think that there are three levels to helping and supporting consumers with financial services. The first is what you could call financial capability, where your outcomes would be to ensure that all consumers have at least a basic working understanding of the basic financial terms. We see people who do not understand what an interest rate means and or that it is good in savings and bad in credit and so on. We get people coming into citizens advice bureaux saying, &#147;I&#146;ve got this loan agreement, but what does it mean?&#148; Or they might say, &#147;It is a secured loan,&#148; but they do not really know what a secured loan is. We get people who have been sold things like PPI&#151;payment protection insurance&#151;and they do not even realise that they have been sold PPI, or what it does, and so on.</p>
<p>So there are some outcomes there that you can look at. You can look at people who have participated in things and ask how their perceptions have changed, or you can do survey monitoring, and so on. You do that to look at basic levels of understanding about financial skills and financial knowledge. In addition, we may start to see in the longer term that our levels of debt inquiry go down, because people are more aware of the risks of debt and perhaps more able to budget, and things like that&#151;some very big-wheel things.</p>
<p>Secondly, financial education provides what is called generic financial advice; getting consumers ready to market. Do consumers have a better idea? For instance, in credit, which is an area that I work with a lot, do people understand the features of the credit card and what is unique about that product as opposed to other products? Do they understand what they would use that product for, as opposed to what they would use a different type of product for? You can look at and measure how people&#146;s understanding of those types of questions changes.</p>
<p>The final part is where things go wrong. Can we get people to understand that, if things go wrong, they should come for advice earlier and get their problems sorted more quickly? We can measure that as well. Very few people come for advice about debt before they are actually in crisis; people come when they are in crisis. If they had a better understanding, we could get them in earlier and it would be less expensive and harmful for them. We can measure that too.</p>
<p>So you can see that kind of progression of different levels of intervention. You can look at each of those levels to see how people&#146;s perceptions have changed as a result of an intervention. That is a bit woolly, but I hope that it is not as woolly as the answer you got before.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Vass:</span> In our sector, we have 350 Age Concern centres around the country, most of them offering some form of information and advice service. We are very aware that we need to prove to our funders the value that our centres are delivering, so our centres are developing ways of quantifying their value, for example, in terms of benefit take-up. We would hope and expect that benefit take-up would increase considerably, but it might also be possible even to come up with other measures, for example, a measure of the number of people making a will. There are quite a lot of smaller measures like that one that we can use as targets. Indeed, perhaps even &nbsp;budgetary savings could be measured. By taking a sort of subject-by-subject approach in our research, we certainly hope to demonstrate our worth.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> We must remember that the FSA kicked this thing off only a few years ago and there is some evaluation going on. The next stage is to build a proper evaluative programme to track the short-term measures that we discussed to make change. That is quite feasible to do, and it should be built into the requirement for evaluating the performance of this body. Coming back to the point that I made earlier and that we have discussed, we must build into that evaluation a qualitative measure that the body is acting in an independent way and as an effective consumer advocate in areas where people need to be educated.</p>

Given the patchy nature of the success of its educational efforts over the past few years, does that really provide the credibility that the new body needs?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> I find it hard to give a view on that because, as I said earlier, it is very difficult to run the body in the way in which we would like while we are part of the FSA. There are undoubtedly some good people doing good work. They have had the last couple of years of a large budget to spend, but it is difficult, given the fact that the primary focus of the regulator has been on issues to do with the system, not issues to do with consumer education, to see what they might be capable of if it were entirely up to them.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Vass:</span> May I pick up on confidence and financial stability&#151;the issues to which the new body must have regard? I really believe that there should be a counterbalancing duty to act in the best interests of its users. Indeed, we have found that a lot of people have gone from the third sector, for example, into the Financial Services Authority, so the structural move of the whole body outside will be quite an important signal to users that it is an independent body. That is why it is very important that it should not have the word &#147;authority&#148;, for example, in its title. It can often put off people who are very reluctant and distrustful of authority.</p>

<p> I am curious. We have talked a lot about the changes that will be brought about by the Bill, but I am interested in the earlier comments, which were certainly made at the Treasury Committee, about the impervious nature of the Financial Services Authority to consumer interests, and whether or not the provisions in the Bill will take the FSA further away from the consumer interest and whether we should be thinking in the Bill about doing something to ensure that the FSA itself has a consumer voice within it.

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> I think that we have been conscious since the beginning of this year of a change in the FSA&#146;s approach to meeting its objective for protecting the consumer interest. We have higher-level discussions that &nbsp;are more concerned with policy issues than we have had in the past, and we have seen a considerable change in its approach to enforcement and in its willingness to confront the industry on issues that we think are important. At that level, there has been a big change in the FSA.</p>
<p>The extent to which the change will be maintained in future if the climate moved back at some point towards being more favourable to a light-touch approach is not clear. If we look at what was happening three or four years ago, there was a lot of pressure on the FSA not to over-regulate, and we have seen the effect of that. I do not by any means think that the change is guaranteed but, as we have seen&#151;certainly in the past year&#151;there has been a very big change in the way in which the FSA has approached dealing with consumer protection.</p>

<p> But that, in a sense, has been a response to market conditions and the failures of regulation of the past.

We were disappointed that they were there as individuals and it was not a formal introduction. They are but two members of a board, although they are a voluble two, so perhaps they will have more than their fair share of air time.</p>
<p>We hope that it is not just window-dressing, because there are still some fundamentals in the FSA&#146;s activities that need to change. The biggest one for us&#151;so much of the problem stems from this&#151;is around transparency and the narrow interpretation that the FSA has of its powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act to name those firms entering enforcement. We absolutely understand that the FSA would not want to name firms that are under some form of discussion or investigation, but when you are into enforcement, you have gone beyond that point.</p>
<p>We have to my mind what is a ridiculous case&#151;although that implies a degree of amusement, which is far from the situation&#151;in which four firms are going through enforcement over how they deal with mortgage arrears but, because they are not named, the judges who are looking at those firms&#146; repossession actions are unaware that the FSA has any problem with how they are behaving. What we shall end up with is what we had with that company that was named: people losing their houses because the judges at the time did not know that the firm was not behaving well. Enforcement came too late for those individuals.</p>
<p>We certainly feel that there is a case to say something. We took an opinion from Queen&#146;s Counsel, which was that the FSA interprets its powers too narrowly. We have written to the Chancellor and others asking, in the pre-Budget report, for the formal instigation of a review of the FSA&#146;s interpretation of those powers. From that refusal to name firms that are causing problems in the market, in the name of ensuring the stability of those &nbsp;firms, we think so much else follows: so many of the problems of PPI mis-selling, or our difficulty in advising the consumers we interact with to avoid firms or a particular product. If the FSA was more proactive, a large part of the problems that we all see further down the line would go away.</p>

<p> May I come to Citizens Advice for a moment? A very positive statement was made by the chief executive of the FSA, about it taking more robust action to protect a consumer, among others. Yet, if I reflect on the decision not to name and shame, that would appear to suggest that the industry still has too much influence on FSA decisions. How does Citizens Advice look on that?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> I think we would agree with that. More prosaically, the point about openness is important. We found two things with the FSA. First, it is still learning to regulate a lot of the things that we deal with: general insurance or PPI, together with mortgages, are two big areas of consumer detriment that it has taken on relatively recently.</p>
<p>Two things from PPI are instructive. First, when the FSA found problems in the market, its initial approach was to write to the firms and ask them to change. After a year, the firms had not changed. What we have seen is a progressive type of thing&#151;people saying, &#147;Okay, we have to do something a bit tougher&#148;. What would be useful for us&#151;and this is the point&#151;is a measure to deal with the FSA not being tough enough.</p>
<p>The FSA approach was a bit like Sergeant Wilson from &#147;Dad&#146;s Army&#148; saying, &#147;Would you mind awfully changing?&#148; rather than, &#147;You have got to change and be better.&#148; What triggers do people like us have to say to the FSA, &#147;No, you need to do more; there are still problems.&#148; There are no external triggers to make them do anything; they move at the pace they want to. When the in-fashion thing was light touch, the FSA was light-touch; now the fashion is more regulation, so there is more regulation. In a year&#146;s time we could be back to light touch. Both those positions may be wrong; what we want is effective regulation when it is needed.</p>
<p>So, first, what are the external triggers to make that happen? Secondly, how open is the FSA? The FSA does an awful lot of good research work in its thematic reviews, but it does not say much about the outcomes. With the mortgage arrears thing, we know that they have taken a firm into enforcement for things such as treating people badly with arrears management and also for overcharging them for arrears charges. But we do not have a very public statement saying what is fair in arrears charging and what is not.</p>
<p>We think that there are things&#151;this goes back to the public awareness point, the public education point&#151;that the FSA needs to be better at, informing consumers and people like us about what it is doing and the outcomes of what it is doing. If it says, &#147;This firm has been fined for overcharging people in arrears, and this is why we think they are overcharging&#148;, we can advise people we see and say, &#147;Look, you may be being overcharged as well&#148;, and we can complain about that.</p>
<p>What triggers are there to ensure that people like us, who get oversight from people like you, stay regulated? Also, how can we make FSA be more open and ensure that they actually say what they are doing, why they are &nbsp;doing it, and have they looked at things like mortgage arrears targets and if they have, what outcomes did they come to, and what do they propose to do next? It is about setting that agenda, so they cannot move along at the pace that suits where they are.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> Section 348 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 is about the power that the FSA has to release information. There is always an argument about how far it can go in publicising information that it collects as a regulator and which may or may not be fair to put into the public domain. To give some clarity in that area would enable it, as an example, to give the names of companies that are going into enforcement. As Peter said, that would be a very big step forward.</p>

<p> Thank you. I turn again to Which? You said earlier, in relation to unsolicited or unrequested credit card cheques, that a tiny number of people seem to take up the offer. Let me act as devil&#146;s advocate for a moment. Let us assume that those consumers are acting rationally. Even though they pay more and the terms are worse, when they look around, they find the offer better than anything else that they can find on the market because of their vulnerability. Why should we bother getting rid of unrequested credit card cheques?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Vicary-Smith:</span> There are a number of reasons, and two of them stand out. First, you have 296 million cheques going out every year that have details printed on them, and the fraud implications alone of that I would not like to contemplate. They are sent as a separate letter, so you do not know you are getting them until they come in the post, and a number of us are concerned about that dimension.</p>
<p>The second thing is the implications that that can have for individuals. For what you propose as devil&#146;s advocate to be valid, there would have to be a conscious, planned decision for an individual that that was the best form of borrowing. That is not how it works with these cheques.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Vicary-Smith:</span> My colleagues here will have more direct evidence. To describe the psychological process, I think that they are designed to be much more for someone who is suffering&#151;possibly in debt, and certainly in financial hardship. A cheque arrives through the post, and you are able simply to fill it out for &#163;1,500&#151;a large amount&#151;and to cash it. It is a temptation to see that as an easy way out, and I would argue that that is psychologically more important than the idea that it is a planned form of borrowing.</p>

<p> Perhaps whoever wants to respond further will take on board the point about unrequested credit card limits. I believe that it is much more important, and I suspect that it looms much larger. How important is it that we consider not only credit card cheques but credit card limits?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> It is very important. Here is an example: a case from a CAB of a 70-year-old woman whose 81-year-old husband became ill with cancer. They were put into a cycle of supplementing their pension income by using credit cards. Every time they got to the limit, it was raised by the creditor, and they were also sent credit card cheques&#151;this pattern of practices was mentioned earlier&#151;so they ended up horrendously in debt. You are right. The point about credit card cheques that was made by Peter is that people are being encouraged into borrowing, but they have not had time to think about it properly and it might be harmful to them. That applies even more so, I suppose, to credit card limit increases and limit increases on other running account credit products, including store cards and perhaps overdrafts.</p>
<p>A range of different credit products have a limit that can be raised by a lender unilaterally. We have seen case after case of people&#146;s limit being raised, particularly when they are in financial difficulties. We see people slowly going into a spiral of more and more debt and then they get into using one credit card to pay down other credit cards, an overdraft or a loan and, before you know it, you are completely out of control. There is a pattern, and part of that is unsolicited increases in credit card limits, which means that people are getting more into debt and they are not being advised as to the risks of that. Often they are in financial difficulty and the credit card company is responding to that financial difficulty by saying, &#147;Well, have some more credit.&#148; There is a pattern of quite destructive practices.</p>
<p>As a general point, the unsolicited issue of credit is the kind of practice that we need to address if we want to deal with the debt levels we have seen over the past 10 years. So you are absolutely right that credit limits in running account credit&#151;credit cards in particular&#151;really need to be addressed urgently.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Vicary-Smith:</span> The response the industry will give you is, &#147;Actually, we use this. We give people a little bit of credit and when they show they can manage it we give them a little bit more, and it&#146;s a safe way into having a credit history.&#148; What we are proposing does not prevent that practice at all. We are all suggesting that people are told, &#147;This is how we want to manage your account, so you can opt in to having your limit increased in this way.&#148; That is still perfectly acceptable and that would be permissible under what we propose. It is this other behaviour that would be outlawed. The truth is that that is where they make their money, so they do not want that bit outlawed.</p>

<p> May I turn to the consumer financial education body, because someone mentioned earlier the inadequacies of the previous FSA regime? There was a lot of discussion when the FSA was created by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 about how much of the funding available to the FSA should go into this area&#151;it was 1 per cent. or 2 per cent., and that bedevilled it. What can you produce with 1 per cent. or 2 per cent.? Nothing but a few pamphlets to be distributed around. Although the amount has increased over the years, the success has been to garner funding from other sections to wider your remit. What are your views about how we can have a sophisticated funding regime that will mean that this new body can rise to the challenge? There is a significant challenge in respect of what we are asking it to do in the longer term.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Vass:</span> Stability of funding is a key issue. Ad hoc figures that increase and decrease a lot from year to year are probably less easy to manage in terms of funding this sort of work than a stable funding stream, because the set-up costs of any financial education project can be high. It is important that the authority has the powers to take in funding from a wide range of sources, including the credit industry, to lever in funding from other sources, potentially, and to have a co-ordinating role to ensure that the money is used in the most efficient way by drawing together all the different strands of activity across the various bodies that are interested in this area.</p>

<p> On that point&#151;I do not know if anyone has any views&#151;I was particularly concerned because the industry, clearly, will be a major funder for this project and that will probably start off reasonably well.

How do we ensure we do not get bogged down in that sort of difficulty?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> I think that the point that was made earlier about evaluating the performance of this agency is quite important, because the industry will fund it if the effect of the agency is to get people to use the industry. If they do start saving more and they do start buying protection, it has to be a very effective way of promoting the industry. So, one would assume that the two things are joined up. It is in the interests of consumers and it is also in the interests of the industry&#151;as long as there is competition.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> My colleagues who work in this area say they have had long-standing relationships with some financial services providers. We have been working with Prudential for nine years, Barclaycard for six, and Nationwide and Abbey for three. So, there is clearly an appetite among financial services providers to work with people like us on financial education products. We have been working for them for many years and producing outcomes that work, which we then evaluate.</p>
<p>You are right that the industry will gripe if it thinks it is putting in money that has nothing coming out of it. On the other hand, there are clearly firms that see the benefit of this and are willing to invest money in it. In relation to that kind of co-ordination view, hopefully what we can do is to encourage more of that or lever in more money that will support the good work that these firms are doing. Probably key to how we evaluate it is that we have to demonstrate it is doing good stuff. It is a case of building on a willingness that is certainly already there.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> Well, that is not quite how it happens at the moment, but last year, I think, the FSA put &#163;25 million into consumer education out of a total levy of whatever it was&#151;a little more than 10 times that. So, in a sense that is how they are now being represented and how the money is being spent. The money may transfer, but that levy is in a sense already present within the FSA&#146;s budget.</p>

<p> I do think that careful thought needs to go into this. To take my own constituency, I have been to two different schools: one where HBOS is doing its bit for consumer education, and one where Barclays is. That is going on all over the country, and it is all done voluntarily. We see it as part of those firms&#146; overall effort to burnish their reputation&#151;understandably so. But what happens when you start to levy them to do that as a matter of course? Will they then say, &#147;Well, all that other stuff goes by the wayside&#148;? There needs to be some very careful consideration to make sure that we maximise the amount that is going into that area.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Peter Tutton:</span> I suppose that the advantage of the levy is that it does give us stability, and it will also probably provide a greater resource. In terms of the credibility of the new organisation&#151;this point was raised earlier&#151;we would like to see a step change in the provision of consumer education and in the way that consumers can be helped better to understand financial products, so that they do not get into terrible difficulty with things like debt and mis-selling. That probably is not going to come about through putting in money here and there, welcome and productive though that is. Those are things that you need to balance against each other.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> I also think that this issue is about an independent trusted source, which is something that an individual brand cannot necessarily provide. That is very important to rebuilding confidence in using the industry. If I were running that kind of business, I would be very interested in funding something that was genuinely independent, and that would draw people into our business who would otherwise not come in.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Vass:</span> May I also pick up one of the issues to do with smaller, voluntary funded schemes? Unless a large amount of money is devoted over a long period of time, too often the aim is to produce a particular resource that is easy and relatively cheap, without the follow-through. That is really where we need to turn this whole thing around, so that we have that co-ordination and can actually build it into the evaluation.</p>

<p> Maybe we should have had someone from the National Union of Teachers here, because it is one of the major obstacles to further development of the consumer financial education sector. I take your point, and in an era when the industry has relied so strongly on incentivised sales processes, we need to get it to understand that creating confidence through consumer education will probably do it much more good in the long term than trying to sell through incentivised schemes.</p>

<p> Some unkind people might look at key aspects of the Bill&#151;such as the tripartite committee, for example, which did not work and which we are trying to make better&#151;and they might say that what the Bill proposes is the same committee, but with a different name.</p>
<p>Jane, in your evidence you say that although the Financial Services Authority has done good work in putting financial capability on the map, an independent body is now needed. Given that an independent body is needed, some unkind people will say, in relation to the Bill, &#147;Well, they said we are taking this duty or responsibility away from the FSA and giving it to the new body, but the new body is embedded in the FSA.&#148; The staff will, the FSA assures us, be transferred lock, stock and barrel, and there is even mention of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 in the Bill. The FSA is appointing the board, and it is allowing the Chancellor to have a say in appointing a chair and a deputy. It is collecting the levy&#151;and charging the board for doing so&#151;setting the budget and reviewing how efficient the body is. I asked the FSA how independent it regarded that to be. You would not have to be unkind to say that it does not sound very independent at all. Why are you so enthused about this new era in the field?</p>

<p> You say that that independence has to be buttressed, but the FSA is appointing the board. The Committee has heard evidence assuring us that the appointment of the staff would be by public advert, coming through the FSA. I am not sure there is anything in the Bill that states that the board will actually sit down to interview and appoint staff. I presume that the human resources function in the FSA will do that. The whole thing appears to be an FSA body with a different name. Where do you think that independence is going to come from?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Vass:</span> No. The other thing I would pick out is the annual plan. The body does have a duty to consult widely on the annual plan, including with consumers. Looking beyond the governance structure, the other reason why we think an independent body is necessary is that people externally see that sort of Government-led and regulator-led body and decide that it is another body that they do not want to engage with.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> Perhaps I could cast a little light here. First of all, the people who have been working on this in the FSA do have a lot of knowledge, so it would be a pity to lose that. What you are really talking about is the leadership in this particularly area. Those in the leadership have to see themselves as independent champions of the consumer, and the question is whether the FSA appoints those kind of people.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Adam Phillips:</span> Yes. Those people should be appointed by a Nolan process, so that there are independent people involved in the appointment. As I said about the Financial Ombudsman Service, which is similarly tied to the FSA, with that body they seem to have created a relatively independent board, which has caused them some stress at times. If they pursue the same process, it should be quite acceptable.</p>
<p>On the question of who else it would report to if it was not part of the FSA, you begin to look around and you can see that it could be aligned with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills or the Treasury.</p>
