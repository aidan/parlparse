<p> The Committee will have noted that, in relation to all the clauses bar one, the official Opposition have adopted what might be called a scorched-earth policy towards the Bill. At first glance, we were inclined to take the same view of the next two clauses. However, I have to confess that we have looked at them again. They were introduced by Lord Graham in the upper House and the Department allowed them a lot of leeway. Clause 27, in particular, was welcomed by our noble Friend Lord Hanningfield. We have no objection to the clauses.</p>

<p> I shall make one important point. We are now dealing with references to freewomen and freemen. Should the term not simply be &#147;a freeperson&#148;, given the prevailing wisdom that now we have a chair, not a chairman, and we talk about persons, not men and women? Should the term not be &#147;a freeperson&#148;, or perhaps just &#147;a free&#148;?</p>

<p> It is a pleasure to serve under your leadership&#151;chairmanship, not leadership, Mr. Illsley, unless something more bizarre is going on. Bearing in mind what has already happened in Committee today, I would not be at all surprised if you had plans for world domination.</p>
<p>I shall make some general comments about freedoms of cities and towns. It is fantastic to recognise the hard work of citizens in such a way. It is a valuable honour to bestow. But once again, why is it necessary to set it down in primary legislation? I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify that matter. I understand the problem&#151;some charters laying down how freemen and freewomen of a city or town are elected have become out of date and make it difficult to appoint women&#151;but I am not entirely sure why that needs to be taken in hand in primary legislation.</p>
<p>I understand that such laws need to be more easily amendable, but why not free up the organisations on the ground to allow them to use their discretion? Some of the provisions are eminently sensible. The recognition of civil partners and spouses and the admission of women are welcome, but I am not entirely sure why the Bill needs to deal with whether we call them freemen or women.</p>
<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall pointed out to me, some of the qualifying resolutions require a majority of the existing freemen or women to elect the people whose names will be added. I wonder, as those people are often getting a little bit old, whether they might run out of numbers. I am slightly worried that, if the requirement is for freemen to nominate someone else to be given the freedom, there might not be enough of them around to make that decision. I wonder whether that issue needs to be addressed. It is an example of where we need to give more flexibility on the ground, rather than specifying things rigidly in primary legislation. However, everyone welcomes the principle that the clause is trying to achieve.</p>

<p> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr. Illsley. I am glad that there is a broad welcome from both Opposition parties to the principles behind the clause. As the hon. Member for Wycombe pointed out, it was fully welcomed in the other place.</p>
<p>On the question of primary legislation, it is true that at least one guild has been able to amend the rights of admission to include women, but much depends on how the rights of admission were established&#151;if in a charter, on what the charter says. Although some guilds have found sufficient flexibility in their rules to enable them to admit women or make other amendments to their admissions practices, others have not been able to do so because the charters or other sources of law from which their rules derive have no simple process for amendment.

<p> I understand that point, but looking back to the broader thrust of the Bill, which the Government claim is trying to engage people in democracy, could we not have much broader terms that would allow some kind of public ballot or petition to prompt the granting of the freedom of a city to individuals, rather than a narrowly defined group of people? Would this not be an opportunity to throw open the whole issue to more public engagement, rather than just introducing some narrow changes that, while making improvements to make it easier for women to be admitted, for example, do not address the bigger issue?</p>

<p> It has been a long day. This clause was the subject of some debate in another place, particularly by Liberal Democrat peers. Those of us who were local borough and district councillors or were involved in local government in the 1980s and 1990s understand the background. The Widdecombe report of 1986 correctly led to the decision to exclude certain officers based on salary from serving in a representative capacity on other local authorities under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.</p>
<p>The Opposition believe that the clause is incongruous. It is clear from the debate in another place that there was no rationale for watering down the Widdecombe proposals. The Minister may refer to the Councillors Commission&#146;s decisions on political restrictions, but the clause begins the process of undermining what eventually had a political consensus when it was established. That &nbsp;legislation defended the integrity and professionalism of officers and reassured elected councillors that the advice that they received from paid officers was both impartial and not the result of their political allegiance. The clause, however, begins to undermine that by seeking to disregard the responsibility and duty of the local authority to keep a register of those affected by the 1989 Act.</p>
<p>On that basis, perhaps the Minister will explain the rationale for including the clause in this part of the Bill. It seems to be a case of micro-managing the affairs of local authorities who are perfectly capable of interpreting correctly the prevailing legislation. Can the Minister reassure us that this is not the beginning of the end of ensuring that political partiality does not creep back into the system?</p>

<p> Conservative Members think that the clause will water down the Widdecombe rules, and I share some of their concerns that it does appear to be a partial process: it will remove the salary restrictions but will not seek to put anything else in its place. Simply imposing an arbitrary wage level may not make sense, because some posts with lower wages may be politically sensitive and other posts that are above the threshold may not need to be politically restrictive. I would like greater freedom for local authorities to determine such things and to ensure that declarations of interest can be registered for all employees using a clear system.</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who was employed by a local council, I think that just because someone is unable to be politically active does not necessarily mean that their decisions are therefore impartial. Someone may not be able to declare their views publicly, but that does not mean that their private views might not cause similar difficulties. In this case, the Government have a much bigger story to tell. They are nibbling away at one aspect of it without necessarily giving people confidence that there is a process further down the line that will keep partiality out of key areas of government, as it rightly needs to be.</p>

<p> Before Report, I wonder whether the Minister could give us a list of the number of people in one county who are councillors on a different council. I wonder whether it is a real or a mythical problem. I cannot think of a single person in North Yorkshire, in the whole time that I have represented it, who has been an employee of one authority and a councillor in another. People cannot leave their political allegiance behind when they go in and out of the relative town hall.</p>

<p> No, I accept that, but the most high-profile way in which someone might wish to express a political opinion is by standing for election to a council, and there are a number of bodies that have a political role to which people can be nominated. The Dales national park is not entirely made up of councillors, for example. I wonder how real the issue is. Quite frankly, why are we bothering with it? I think that we have invented a problem, and I do not understand why we should invent a solution to a non-problem.</p>

<p> Hon. Members&#146; contributions suggest that there might be some misunderstanding about what the clause will actually do. It will merely remove the link between salary level and the designation for local authority posts. The salary level is currently a sum of money, not a scale for a post, and the sum of money has not been updated for a number of years. We therefore continue to support the policy behind the Widdecombe rules, which help to ensure the political impartiality of local authority employees. The removal of the link between salary and whether a post is considered politically restricted will not undermine the impartiality.</p>
<p>If the legislation is enacted, the following posts will remain politically restricted: chief executive, chief officer, deputy chief officer, monitoring officer, political assistant, and any person whose post is specified in a list maintained by the local authority whose duties involve giving advice to the authority on a regular basis and/or speaking regularly to the media on behalf of the authority. In relation to the last category, the ultimate test of whether an individual post is politically sensitive will depend on the nature of the duties that the post entails. Every officer falling within that category may be entitled to exemption from political restriction if the nature of the duties of that post does not require the post holder to be politically neutral. Applications for exemption are considered by the local authority standards committee.</p>

<p> I am trying to understand what process will follow if the changes are adopted. Presumably, some posts are automatically politically restricted at the moment because of the salary level. If, after the proposals are put in place, some posts will not be automatically restricted because of the salary level and a judgment may be needed about whether or not they should be deemed to be politically restricted, will every council therefore have to go through a process of auditing those affected to ensure that positions are not missed or added by mistake?</p>

<p> I do not think that there was any confusion among Conservative Members. We just want assurances from the Minister that the Government are still committed to the enduring principles of the Widdecombe report, which have lasted for 20 years.

<p> I think that we are getting into specifics, because it is a point on the scale of salaries, but it will be a specific sum of money each year. I do not know whether the hon.

<p> Our approach to clause 30 is, in a manner of speaking, the opposite of our approach to clauses 28 and 29, which we have just considered. When we originally looked at clauses 28 and 29, we were inclined to be sceptical and looked at what happened in the Lords, but we came to the conclusion that they should pass muster. We have not tabled one of our repetitious and unselectable amendments in an attempt to delete clause 30, because we want to give the Minister a chance to justify it. Having said that, it did not have a friendly reception in the other place, where both Lord Hanningfield and Baroness Hanwee were extremely sceptical about it, drawing attention to the difference between the present state of affairs, where there is a monitoring officer, and a section 151 officer, and trying to get the Minister in the Lords to explain where that post would slot into the present arrangements. Indeed, Baroness Hanwee spoke of her opposition to the clause.</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding like a broken gramophone record, we come back again and again to the same question: bang in the middle of part 1 is the word &#147;must&#148;. Must we have &#147;must&#148; in the Bill? Need the statute book have such specific obligations placed on local authorities? The Minister probably has some explanation up her sleeve for why the finance officer, referred to in subsection 4(c), and the monitoring officer and the head of the authority&#146;s paid service, referred to in paragraphs (b) and (a) respectively, may not be designated and why other posts may be, and I look forward to hearing it.</p>
<p>In summary, obviously the role of scrutinising what takes place in local councils is extremely important. We on the official Opposition Benches say that the correct balance must be struck between proper scrutiny and the need not to overburden local authorities with so many scrutinising duties from the centre that it makes it difficult for them to run their affairs with flexibility. We &nbsp;wait to hear what the Minster has to say, but we are far from convinced that the clause, as drafted, should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p> The key question is if this is the answer, what is the question? Is there a concern that the current scrutiny processes are not sufficient? Do we feel that the scrutiny procedures are not scrutinised enough? If so, do we need to open up channels for that to take place? I draw the Committee&#146;s mind back to some comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall, who said that if we are imposing this measure on all authorities, does it pass the Isles of Scilly test? Will the Isles of Scilly, which has a very small council, now be required to appoint another officer to undertake scrutiny, when there are a relatively small number of officers to scrutinise?</p>
<p>I am not clear why the duty that is outlined in this clause does not apply</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;to a district council for an area for which there is a county council&#148;</p>
<p>as outlined in subsection (5). Surely if such a position is needed at local authority level to ensure that overview and scrutiny committees follow due process, then that should apply at any level of local government. I do not see why it should just apply to the principal authority in two-tier authorities. I share the scepticism that has been expressed, and I look forward to the Minister explaining the question to which this is the answer.</p>

<p> I am glad that we all agree that overview and scrutiny is an important way of ensuring local accountability and transparency. Moreover, it is an important tool for empowering communities and enabling local people, through their democratically elected representatives, to participate. However, we must ensure that all lead councils rise to the standards of the best, and that all are aware that this powerful tool is an effective means of driving improvement.</p>
<p>For effective scrutiny, it is important that there is proper officer support and that officer resources are in place to provide that support and advice. The evaluation document, &#147;The New Council Constitutions: The Outcomes and Impact of the Local Government Act 2000&#148;, made a number of important points. First, less officer support is provided for scrutiny compared with executive functions. Secondly, scrutiny works best and is more robust in areas in which resources are committed. Thirdly, scrutiny arrangements are not as robust as executive arrangements. Moreover, we looked carefully at the Centre for Public Scrutiny survey, which sought views from the local government sector on the single element that would do most to improve the overview and scrutiny function. One of the highest responses was to provide more resources and staff.</p>
<p>We also consulted extensively on how to implement the proposals for scrutiny and support set out in the White Paper, &#147;Communities in control&#148;. The Centre for Public Scrutiny thought that that would be essential, if scrutiny is to benefit from the new powers and responsibilities outlined in the White Paper. We looked at three corporate statutory posts, which, experience has shown, are the foundation for ensuring that councils devote sufficient attention and support to those key functions in a way that is appropriate to their local circumstances.</p>
<p>We have given careful consideration to views expressed in the consultation, which make a compelling case for our proposal to replace the requirement on lead councils to have a scrutiny officer who is responsible for supporting the work of their overview and scrutiny committee, which does not have to be their only role. We are not saying that councils should have one person who only does that. We leave that decision to local councils.</p>

<p> I confirm that if this clause is passed, the resources will be made available within the funding process to support that role. I do not think that the approach we have set out is overly prescriptive, which was the point made by the hon. Member for Wycombe. It recognises the important role officer support plays in driving effective scrutiny, but balances that with the need to allow local flexibility. We have not attempted any complex prescription of the scrutiny resources, and the clause provides scope for local authorities to determine these detailed arrangements for themselves.</p>
<p>I have been asked why we have excluded certain council officers from becoming a scrutiny officer. Just as the scrutiny function is kept separate from the executive function by ensuring that members of the executive cannot serve on overview and scrutiny committees, it makes sense that the scrutiny officer should not hold one of the key corporate posts as head of paid services or chief financial officer. The monitoring officer&#146;s role is to ensure that the authority conducts its business lawfully and with propriety. The post carries certain powers and duties. Although the role of scrutiny is to some extent complementary in that it also provides checks and balances on the exercise of executive functions, the role of the scrutiny officer is to support scrutiny by members, and not to carry it out. Allowing those two roles to be carried out by the same person could blur the distinction between the two functions and lead to confusion.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne asked why the requirements are not applied to district councils. We are trying to ensure that the quality of scrutiny in councils responsible for local area agreements is raised to the standards of the current best, which is why we have confined them to those authorities. On that basis, I hope that we can pass the clause.</p>

<p> The official Opposition, like other Opposition parties, were not convinced by the Minister&#146;s explanation of clause 30. She said that the view had generally been expressed that it would be useful to have more resources and scrutiny and that representations had been made to the Department for Communities and Local Government, but it did not seem to us, on the basis of her comments, that local authorities and others were knocking at the Department&#146;s door saying that scrutiny in local authorities was poor.</p>
<p>And that brings me directly to our amendments. Very often, amendments are probing amendments designed to test the Government&#146;s intentions. However, these amendments would give the clause sufficient flexibility to make it just about bearable. Amendment 33 would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s regulation-making power and give local authorities the flexibility to make this provision, if they so wish. Amendment 34 would replace &#147;regulations&#148;&#151;again, made from the centre&#151;with the more pliable word &#147;arrangements&#148;. That is also the case with the next amendment. Perhaps we have taken a rather severe view of any guidance issued by the Secretary of State in amendment 36. However, together, our amendments would make the minimum necessary changes to the clause to ensure that it does not place a burden on local authorities that, on the basis of the Minister&#146;s evidence, they should not have to carry.</p>

<p> I think that everybody in the Committee agrees that ensuring a strong scrutiny process is important in order for people to have confidence that their councils are well run and that, if there are any problems, a mechanism exists for investigating them fully. The Liberal Democrats have no problem with the establishment of joint overview and scrutiny committees. There are many issues on which councils working together can be run more efficiently, and we can see an improved process.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we cannot see why the process must be determined by the Secretary of State. The concern is that it brings forward a background issue, which is that the Government always presume the best intentions in the Government and the worst in local authorities. The provisions are just another example of that: clearly, local councils cannot be trusted to come &nbsp;up with satisfactory arrangements; that will only be achieved if those arrangements are specified, once again, in primary legislation. That seems to be the theme of virtually every clause in the Bill.</p>
<p>The amendments presented by the hon. Member for Wycombe seem entirely sensible. They would make it clear that it is not only the local authority&#146;s right but its responsibility to ensure that the process works effectively. For councils that might struggle to do so, the regulations might be an additional burden that will make it more difficult to fulfil those duties. Once again, the Government have no business requiring all local authorities to act entirely in a specified way. It is a matter for local authorities. It is depressing that we continue to have discussions such as this.</p>

<p> The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. This is called the Local Democracy Bill, and the White Paper that informed much of it was all about putting communities back in control. Exactly how will the Bill put communities back in control? Even looked at in the most positive way, which is that it is about giving communities a better service&#151;I am sure that the Government will present it that way&#151;it certainly does not put them in control. It puts power in the hands of one person only, and that person is the Secretary of State.</p>

<p> On Second Reading, I declared my interest as a chairman of the Centre for Public Scrutiny; I stress that this is a non-pecuniary interest, a non-remuneratory post.</p>
<p>I have to say that what I have been hearing from the Opposition is a load of nonsense. This is not some kind of unwarranted Government interference: it is a sensible measure to enable joint scrutiny to be carried out by different local authorities&#151;scrutiny that engages other activities, notably the health service and the criminal justice system.

<p> Will the hon. Gentleman please leave me for a moment? I simply want to make this point. If central Government do not create a clear, legal framework under which it is absolutely clear to local authorities that they can set up joint scrutiny committees, there will inevitably be variations in interpretation of what is within their power and what is not. This is where there is an absolute case for central Government to set out the framework. It does not impose obligation on local authorities: the powers are permissive. How they set up their joint scrutiny committees will be for them to decide, as will whether they set them up at all.</p>
<p>Both Opposition parties are completely wide of the mark on this. They are trying to see some kind of authoritarian, central Government diktat where it does not apply at all.</p>

<p> If the right hon. Gentleman, to whose experience I defer, wants a framework he can have one, but why should not that framework say &#147;local authorities may&#148; rather than &#147;the Secretary of State may&#148; by regulations?</p>

<p> For the very simple reason, as I just explained, that some authorities may take a different interpretation of the extent of the powers for some of the scrutiny bodies that may be set up, not just with other authorities, but with other parties as well. All the evidence of scrutiny&#151;the Minister referred to the experience of the Centre for Public Scrutiny&#151;suggests that there are huge benefits from cross-silo working by different authorities and bodies in the public service. We should surely be encouraging this and promoting a framework that makes it possible.</p>

<p> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, I defer to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s interest in and passion for this issue, but we are not talking about encouragement. The Bill is effectively forcing local authorities to amalgamate their functions. What is wrong with using the term &#147;may&#148; and giving more authority and autonomy to local authorities, if they have issues relating to social and economic commonality of interest?</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is completely wrong. If he reads the Bill, he will see that the relevant phrase says:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision under which any two or more local authorities in England may&#148;&#151;</p>
<p>It says &#147;may&#148;, not &#147;must&#148;. It is permissive; it helps local authorities; it gives clarity. It is Government acting sensibly: acting in response to representations, made by many people with experience of good scrutiny, that we should be encouraging cross-border and cross-sector working to ensure a more joined-up approach to the delivery of public services and better government at a local level.</p>

<p> The right hon. Gentleman says that the problem is that there have been variations in interpretation, but does he not think that a good thing, which allows for the boundaries to be pushed even further? Is it not also slightly risky to assume that joint scrutiny processes will in every case help overcome some of the silo thinking? I can think of a joint health and adult social care overview scrutiny committee that, from the point of view of the public, has been very confusing because it looks at decisions for which it has no responsibility. In many cases, it has been criticised for decisions that are entirely in the realm of health, and nothing to do with the council it is responsible for scrutinising. So this provision is not the only way of breaking down these silo issues.</p>

<p> The hon. Lady makes two points, the first of which is to leave it all to local authorities. I entirely concur with the principle that the format of the joint scrutiny committees can probably best be determined at a local level. The problem is that if individual local authorities are advised by their lawyers that their powers are perhaps limited, we may get different interpretations. One authority could take the view that it has the power to set up such a committee, and another might take a different view. That is why it is sensible to have a national framework.</p>
<p>The hon. Lady&#146;s second point was that joint scrutiny is not always a good thing. Of course it is not always, and it can sometimes be done badly, but there are huge gains from different organisations with different perspectives working together. The experience of local authority involvement in health scrutiny is an interesting issue. It has helped local authorities, with their considerable social care responsibilities, to have a much better understanding of the interface between what they do and what the national health service does. That must be a good thing.</p>

<p> I have no doubt that it has helped to encourage joint working, but this is the Local Democracy Bill and much of what we have been considering is about aiding people&#146;s understanding. I am not entirely convinced that in every case, these joint committees help people to understand where the responsibilities, and ultimately the budgets, also lie.</p>

<p> They may not have worked in every case, but they have overwhelmingly been a force for good. I would have thought that the hon. Lady and her party would support this as a way of encouraging more joined-up working at local level, with the permissive power to enable local authorities to take useful initiatives.</p>

<p> I have a sense that we are travelling round different perimeters of the circle to arrive at the same point. If local authorities had to discover the boundaries of their powers themselves, would not the tradition of best practice before very long assert a common view of what was permitted? Would not that process of experimentation in a sense be rather creative in the process? Secondly, what the hell is the Local Government Association for?</p>

<p> Probably, given its recent difficulties, it is best to pass over that second question. On the first question, I give the right hon. Gentleman three names to show why his assumption is a bit optimistic. They are the names of local authorities with which I had considerable dealings when I was Local Government Minister because they were in an appalling mess: the London borough of Hackney, the metropolitan borough of Walsall and the district of Rossendale. Those are three different authorities under different political control&#151;that is the reason why I mention them&#151;that were not working well and where, despite the fact that this had been evident for many years, there was little sign of any improvements.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to give a little nudge and a little help in the right direction. When that is done it can often produce rather remarkable results. I am happy to say that all three of those local authorities are now working very much better&#151;remarkably better than a decade ago. There is evidence of the perfectibility of man, woman and local government, but sometimes it requires a bit of a nudge. So just leaving it to the automatic process, as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, may not be the right approach. The clause is eminently sensible. I believe that the Opposition&#146;s amendments are misconceived and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will recommend the clause to the Committee and that it will approve it.</p>

<p> I thank my right hon. Friend for sharing his considerable expertise and experience on this issue, and I entirely concur with his remarks. Unfortunately, I do not entirely concur, as might be expected, with the remarks of Opposition Members.</p>
<p>I reassure the Committee that we have not opted for this approach because we want to prescribe the fine details of how local arrangements work. To reiterate what my right hon. Friend said, the regulations simply ensure a broad framework and flexibility to address key questions relating to area scrutiny committees. This is an enabling power and a practical measure that allows us to address matters of important detail in regulations, to ensure that the various scrutiny provisions dovetail and work effectively without causing duplication or unnecessary burdens. I certainly see nothing unusual or sinister about making provision for such matters through regulation.</p>
<p>The Committee might be aware that we recently consulted on proposals for joint area scrutiny arrangements. Responses to that consultation highlighted a number of practical considerations. For instance, there were concerns about the need for full and fair representation of all interests and proper governance arrangements, and there is clearly a difficult but important balance to strike, and possibly quite complex arrangements to make.</p>
<p>As the proposal for any two or more authorities to appoint joint overview and scrutiny committees is new, it is even more important that we carefully consider those practical issues and work with key stakeholders to ensure that the right balance is struck. By addressing those detailed matters in regulations, we can ensure that the new arrangements work to deliver real benefits for communities.</p>
<p>On guidance, Parliament agreed and recognised the need for a statutory guidance-making power for the overview and scrutiny provisions introduced by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, including those for joint overview and scrutiny committees. Overview and scrutiny committees are already required to have regard to a basic level of statutory guidance and there is no good reason to treat joint overview and scrutiny committees differently. However, I should like to reassure the Committee that wherever possible, guidance should take the form of sector-led best practice guidance. That is why we are working with the Centre for Public Scrutiny to issue guidance to accompany the new overview and scrutiny powers, thereby limiting the need for statutory guidance.</p>
<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the amendment and support the clause as it stands.</p>

<p> It might be a reflection of what a sad individual I am, but I have found this debate absolutely fascinating. It has been fascinating not because of anything I said, or even, with due respect, because of anything the Minister said&#151;after all, we are both toiling workers in the vineyards respectively of the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister. The debate has not even been fascinating because of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, well informed though she always is.

<p> Mastodons is the word. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich has been far more loyal this afternoon than he was with those ridiculous petition clauses when he voted the wrong way&#151;I should say the right way, by accident or design. Of course, he meant what he said this afternoon.</p>
<p>There was a profound difference of philosophical approach that might illustrate what will happen when we reach the general election, whenever that is. On the one hand, my right hon. Friend says, &#147;What&#146;s the LGA for? What&#146;s best practice for? Leave councils to their own devices and standards will be driven up as they look at what each other do. A thousand flowers will bloom and by some organic and almost ecological process, all will turn out well,&#148; to which the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich says, forcefully, and with every rhetorical device and all the expertise at his command, which is a great deal, &#147;It won&#146;t work. You need the benign hand on the tiller of central Government.&#148; He is wise enough to know that the hand must not be applied heavily, but his position is that we need the hand and for it to be applied lightly&#151;we cannot simply devolve.</p>
<p>That is the difference between the approaches of those two very experienced parliamentarians, both of whom are very knowledgeable in their fields. It will be the big difference at the next election, as has been illustrated by these tiny&#151;</p>

<p> It is interesting for the hon. Gentleman to pose those diametrically opposed philosophical positions, but I am sure that the electorate will cast its mind back to the track record of the previous Conservative Government, and find that they probably did not take exactly the approach he described. They might actually have engaged in a small amount of centralisation of local authorities. Does he agree that we should take with quite a large pinch of salt his portrayal of the positions of his party and the Labour party?</p>

<p> I am willing to throw a pinch of salt over my shoulder if the hon.

However, whether she thinks that such positions are those of the two main parties or not, they are the opposites in the debate.

<p> This is a significant clause. Those members of the Committee who do not possess any special expertise in Welsh affairs&#151;of whom I have to confess I am one&#151;may be tempted to let it slip by without debate. However, it is significant and it gives rise to some questions.</p>
<p>The Minister has not risen to speak, so I shall say a word or two about what the clause seems to do. It sets out a series of framework powers which would extend the legislative competence of the Welsh Assembly by inserting some new matters in field 12&#151;the powers that councils in Wales are allowed to exercise. As the briefing from the Assembly says:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill is an opportunity for the Assembly Government to seek framework powers that will enable it to bring forward proposals for legislation in respect of governance and overview and scrutiny.&#148;</p>
<p>After all, as the brief also says:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The Welsh Assembly Government can only go so far within the existing legislative framework.&#148;</p>
<p>So, new powers mean new competencies. The brief sets out what those are:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;In effect, the Welsh Assembly Government wishes the Assembly to have legislative competence in the areas covered by the provisions of Part II of the Local Government Act 2000. This Act introduced different models for executive arrangements, including the Mayor, Cabinet and Leader and Cabinet models. The executive became responsible for most local authority functions, working within a policy framework set by the full council. The 2000 Act also brought about the creation of overview and scrutiny committees&#148;&#151;</p>
<p>which we have just been considering&#151;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;made up of non-executive (&#145;backbench&#146;) councillors, to scrutinise the work of the executive as well as reviewing policy within and without the council itself as they affected the local area. This legislative competence would enable the Welsh Government to give effect to its policies in this area following consideration of the Beecham Review and the outcome of research commissioned into the role and function of elected members in Welsh local government.&#148;</p>
<p>I think the key question that arises from this, which this Committee ought to consider, and certainly should have an interest in, is what powers the Welsh Assembly Government, or WAG&#151;not to be confused with other WAGs&#151;wish to exercise. I should therefore like to ask some questions about the intentions of the Assembly Government, given&#151;and I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed this&#151;that a Welsh Assembly Government Minister came to brief the House informally on Tuesday on the measures that they wish to pass if the clause is enacted. I am not aware&#151;and I have checked with the other Opposition party and I believe that it also is not aware&#151;of any briefing for this Committee. Will the Minister outline how the process between the Assembly Government and this Parliament is supposed to function and explain why&#151;if I am correct, and I accept that I may have been misinformed&#151;no one from this Committee was made aware of the briefing.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Welsh Assembly Government, the WAG, wish to enact certain powers. They wish to establish</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;joint scrutiny committees between neighbouring authorities&#148;,</p>
<p>a matter we have just been considering. Can the Minister confirm that these committees will be made up of elected members only? The Welsh Assembly Government wants to enable co-option of &#147;representatives from &nbsp;third parties&#148; to these scrutiny committees. It looks as if they will not be made up of elected members only, so I may have answered my own question. How does this equate with the principle of accountability, if these rights are handed over to people who are not accountable to anyone? The Welsh Assembly Government have also said that they wish to introduce &#147;a duty to scrutinise&#148; across &#147;the whole public sector&#148;. Would the Minister say more about what that means? Could they, for example, summon any Minister to appear before a local government committee? If so, is there a case to argue that the power has been drawn rather widely?</p>
<p>The Welsh Assembly Government would apparently like to abolish whipping in scrutiny committees, although how that will be achieved is not clear. Perhaps the Minister could provide an explanation. Could the Minister explain what the Welsh Assembly Government intend to do with such powers? If they are devolved in relation to the proposed redesign of political structures, will local councils be, in some way, forced to adopt structures set by the Welsh Assembly Government?</p>
<p>Then there is a desire of the Welsh Assembly Government that is hard to understand. They wish to strengthen</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;the role of the citizen through councillor calls for action, by which local communities can combine with their local councillor to ensure a matter is addressed by the local authority&#148;.</p>
<p>I would be grateful if the Minister provided some clarification, and, if she cannot do any of that instantaneously, or if the necessary inspiration does not reach her quickly enough, perhaps she will be able to write. We look forward with interest to hearing what she has to say.</p>

<p> I will certainly ask the Welsh Assembly Government to write to the hon. Gentleman. I personally have not met any of their members. I understand that a briefing on a framework power was held on Tuesday 9 June at 3 pm, and that it was publicised to hon. Members when most of us would have been preparing for our afternoon sitting. I can only apologise for that. The policy will be subject to consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government. We intend to give them the powers to decide their decision-making regime. As he will know, we have specifically excluded from the Bill anything in respect of direct elections to executives of county and county borough councils in Wales or the creation of a form of executive requiring direct elections.

<p> I echo those comments. The previous chapter that has just been accepted mainly applies the same standards implemented under the Companies Acts to local authorities. It is entirely sensible for there to be that mirror. This part of the Bill seems largely uncontroversial and sensible. Speaking as an MP who represents an area that has been covered by local government reform and has been undergoing the boundary-making process, I think that the proposals contain sensible amendments. I do not think that they would have resolved all the problems that we experienced in Cornwall, but they address some of the issues and are a big step forward towards a process that will be more timely and will give people confidence in the electoral process. We broadly welcome many of the proposals.</p>

<p> Unlike many of the clauses being considered this afternoon, new clause 4 concerns a request to the Local Government Boundary Commission to advise on proposals for the amalgamation of relevant principal councils. The request does not flow from the Secretary of State, but comes up from the bottom, the councils themselves, which is why we thought that it was worth tabling the new clause. It is a relatively simple measure, and I commend it to the Committee.</p>

<p> We welcome the transfer of functions relating to boundary changes from the Electoral Commission&#146;s boundary committee to the Local Government Boundary Commission. Those are two different jobs and it is important that they are separated. New clause 4 is self-explanatory, and we wish to see a bottom-up process. We welcome variety in local government, and acknowledge that some places will have different set-ups that will be more appropriate for them than others would be. It is important that any review of the boundaries of local government, or any amalgamation of authorities, should be driven by what people want on the ground, rather than by a centralised process. If the new clause is aimed at achieving that, we will be happy to support it.</p>

<p> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. It is the first time that I have had the opportunity to address the Committee, but I will be brief. I wish to emphasise that the new clause also stands in my name. I draw that to the Committee&#146;s attention because I represent a constituency that has just gone through a transition from a two-tier structure to a unitary tier.</p>
<p>In the process of allocating the new unitary ward boundaries, in one part of my constituency we found ourselves in the extraordinary position of not having a single advocate for a particular two-member division that had been proposed. The proposal appeared from nowhere and was imposed by the Electoral Commission on the communities of Church Stretton and Craven Arms in my constituency. It is one of the relatively few two-member wards in my constituency, and within the county. Those two communities have very little in common. They are united by the A49, which is the only Highways Agency trunk road that passes through the constituency. They are seven miles apart.</p>
<p>The community of Church Stretton nestles in the Switzerland of Shropshire. For those of you who do not know that area, it is as it is described. It has some magnificent hills, which are famous for providing the best views between there and the Urals. Travelling eastwards, one cannot get as good a view as one can from the top of the Long Mynd until one hits the Urals. Yet just to &nbsp;its south, in Craven Arms, nestling on the edge of the area of outstanding natural beauty, people do not benefit from quite such spectacular views, beautiful and attractive as the place is, and there is relatively little that unites the two separate towns. Each has its own town infrastructure, yet they have been lumped together in a single ward. That caused intense frustration at every level in the community, including among those wishing to stand for election to the town councils in the respective areas, as well as a couple of the villages that were lumped in with them.</p>
<p>I have been going on at some length and you have been very indulgent in allowing me do so, Mr. Illsley. However, that example lends emphasis and support to the purpose of the new clause: that if areas are going through the fundamental change of a reorganisation of structure, the views of the people on the ground should carry rather more weight than the views of the bureaucratic organisation many miles away, probably in London, seeking to impose some sort of arithmetic calculation to the considerable distress of the local people affected by it. So I encourage the Minister to consider accepting the new clause when she sums up.</p>

<p> The Chairman has been a little bit indulgent because he recalls doing his geography A-level field course in Church Stretton. He rises simply to explain to the Committee that we are debating new clause 4 with clause 57 because the new clause fits into that part of the Bill. We will not take a vote on new clause 4 until we take votes on the new clauses.</p>

<p> The Government broadly support the principles behind the new clause. We agree that it is right that it should be open to local authorities to initiate reviews of their boundaries and, if they consider it appropriate, mergers with neighbouring councils. However, we legislated for such a process in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. Section 8 of the 2007 Act, as amended by the Bill to include reference to the new Boundary Commission, enables any local authority to make a request to the Boundary Commission to conduct a boundary review. Such a review can consider altering local government boundaries, and abolishing or creating local government areas. It therefore provides a mechanism for principal councils to request a review to consider whether two or more local authorities should be amalgamated. The 2007 Act also enables a review to be instigated by a request from the Secretary of State, or on the initiative of the boundary committee.</p>
<p>Clause 57 provides that those functions of the boundary committee will be transferred to the new Local Government Boundary Commission. The new clause is unnecessary as there is already provision to enable councils to make requests for such reviews. In addition, the 2007 Act sets out statutory criteria which the Boundary Commission will have to have regard to when considering any boundary change. These are the need to secure effective and convenient local government, and the need to reflect the identities and interests of local communities. Those are important requirements when any boundary change is being considered.</p>
<p>Section 9 of the 2007 Act provides that, where the Boundary Commission is undertaking a review of local government areas, it must consult the councils of those &nbsp;areas under review and other local authorities, parish councils, or other persons it believes to have an interest. Those could include, for example, local authorities, MPs and police authorities. Section 10 of the 2007 Act allows the Secretary of State to implement, by order, recommendations made by the boundary committee with or without modification. Such an order would be subject to the approval of both Houses. We believe that the statutory process that currently exists provides statutory criteria and a full review process and meets the objectives that the hon. Member for Wycombe has sought to achieve through this clause. I hope that, in the knowledge that the provision already exists, he will withdraw the new clause when we reach that stage.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment 60, in clause 66, page 49, line 13, leave out &#145;must&#146; and insert &#145;may&#146;.</p>
<p>To address amendment 60 I must say a word or two in introduction to part 4 of the Bill, since neither Minister has risen to her feet to do so. We are now approaching the heart of the Bill. The clause on local authority economic assessment will provide space for many of the arguments that you have already heard, Mr. Illsley, I am afraid, in relation to other parts of the Bill, in particular about the first three sets of duties.</p>
<p>What members of the Committee see before them is a proposal that a</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;principal local authority in England must&#148;&#151;</p>
<p>note, &#147;must&#148;&#151;</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;prepare an assessment of the economic conditions of its area.&#148;</p>
<p>In subsection (2) it may revise the assessment</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;or any part of it...at any time&#148;.</p>
<p>That provision was introduced presumably in case subsection (1) proves in practice to be even more inflexible than the clause looks as a whole.</p>
<p>Let us pause for a moment and look at the whole business of economic assessment. Obviously, any reasonably sized local authority worth its salt will have an eye to the economic conditions of its area. In our area, Wycombe district council, which is one of the larger district councils in England, has all sorts of data available to it about the economic conditions in the area as a whole and in the Thames valley&#151;the information is easily accessible&#151;and it makes assessments of the information that is in front of it. However, the first question that the clause and its first two subsections give rise to is, as ever, why that has to be on the statute book. We have asked the question so many times that I shall not repeat it at length. However, I will ask a variant of it. Why is it that Ministers believe that it is important to put an economic assessment&#151;only&#151;on the statute book?</p>
<p>Any local council worth its salt, such as Wycombe district council, does not only prepare economic statistics; it also prepares social, housing and education statistics and assessments. If one burrows through my local council&#146;s website, one can find child poverty statistics. As it is a feature of this clause, I am curious to know why so much stress is placed on economic assessments of the workings of the economy and the issue of prosperity only. Far be it from any member of the Conservative party to take a view that seems sceptical of business&#151;we are not doing that at all&#151;but it is curious that the Government have not thought fit to put a social, environmental or sustainability assessment in the Bill, given that they have thought fit to include an economic assessment.</p>
<p>There are always questions about the balance between growth and the environment, between standard of living and quality of life and how the two interact. The Minister will be aware that Opposition parties have received representations arguing that in this Bill the Government have become over-focused on growth. When the Bill was drawn up, I do not know whether anyone anticipated the promotion of Lord Mandelson to First Secretary of State and his Department&#146;s subsequent swallowing-up of whole other areas of Government, but there seems to be a case for arguing that the Government have put their eggs very strongly in the basket of economic, rather than other forms of assessment. That is a curiosity.</p>
<p>That is the background. If hon. Members cast their eye down the clause, they will see multiple instances of the word &#147;must&#148;&#151;I have highlighted the word five times in my copy, and the clause even starts with a &#147;must&#148;&#151;hence amendment 60. It is an amendment, Mr. Illsley, of a type with which you will be familiar. A moment ago I said that we have no objection to a local authority carrying out economic assessments&#151;how could we? If this clause must be on the statute book, we would prefer to take &#147;must&#148; out and insert the word &#147;may&#148;.</p>
<p>I obviously cannot speak to the amendment that was tabled by a Member who was going to be on the Committee, but no longer is; perhaps the Whips got him and bound him in a dark cupboard.</p>

<p> Indeed. Amendment 60, as ever, seeks to tone down the element of compulsion in this clause by inserting &#147;may&#148; instead of &#147;must&#148;. That would allow local authorities the freedom to conduct economic local area assessments if they so wish. Yet again, we cannot see why it is necessary to include such a restrictive term in the statute book.</p>

<p> On local authority economic assessments, in part 4 of the Bill, it is understandable that during difficult economic times the priority of the Government and local authorities is to focus on understanding the nature of the problem and how it may best be resolved. I share some of the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Wycombe, in particular the reason for framing this measure as a requirement on all local authorities. Most local authorities already have a sustainability strategy, and one would hope that some information might inform that. I wonder to what extent this provision will underline work that already takes place.</p>
<p>The key thing about assessments is that they should inform future actions; councils should not be allowed simply to tick a box stating that they have done one. My concern is about the next stage in the process. If the Government think that the economic assessment is important, surely the next stage is just as important, but the Bill does not really contain anything about that.</p>
<p>I also have some concerns&#151;the Conservatives&#146; amendments highlight these&#151;about the idea that economic assessments must stick rigidly to the boundaries of a local authority, even thought they might bear no relation to the boundaries of economic experience. Some principal authorities might find that their economic circumstances are very similar to those of a neighbouring authority, but within local authorities there might be very different circumstances. It might be difficult to reflect that in a single assessment. For example, I imagine that the economic assessment of the council of the Isles of Scilly would be very similar to that of west Cornwall, but the clause would make it impossible for the council to produce a joint economic assessment with west Cornwall. It requires the whole of Cornwall to conduct one assessment and the Isles of Scilly to conduct another. There is a danger of both duplication and of missing out some of the variations within a local authority, because the clause is so prescriptive in focusing on an economic assessment across a single local authority area.</p>

<p> The hon. Lady is making a strong point. Does she agree that the prescriptive nature of the clause does not take into account the relationship that many local authorities have with urban regeneration companies and other regeneration partnerships? A prescriptive requirement on authorities to prepare such assessments could result in duplication, if an assessment has already been prepared, perhaps on an agency or collaborative basis with an urban regeneration company, for instance.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-09_LOCDEM_04-0_2009-06-11a.11.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" speakername="Julia Goldsworthy" time="14:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/locdem/090611/pm/90611s06.htm#0906124000282" colnum="119">
<p> That is one example of the danger of duplication. Of course, however, that information might also help to inform a principal authority&#146;s assessment. The clause lacks flexibility. The assumption is that the boundaries in place already will be the same as those of economic experience. No doubt we will have a similar discussion on part 5, dealing with regional strategy. Just as there might not be one economic experience in a principal authority, it will be difficult to conduct one economic assessment for a single region with several different economies. I am pre-empting a discussion that we will no doubt have on later clauses.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the lack of flexibility, including in the consideration of what will have an economic influence. My attention is drawn to our experiences in Cornwall with objective 1 funding. The history books show that the primary problem for Cornwall when we tried to qualify for objective 1 funding was that the previous boundaries lumped Devon and Cornwall together as an economic entity. That meant that, despite the fact that one falls of an economic cliff when crossing the Tamar bridge, the poverty in Cornwall was not recognised. As much as anything else, addressing those issues necessitated the realisation that the boundaries were inadequate. After that, consideration had to be given to what those funds were put towards. Although the objective was an improvement in Cornwall&#146;s economy, much of &nbsp;the resource has been invested in education, infrastructure and all kinds of different things. A narrow interpretation of an economic assessment might exclude many of those considerations.</p>
<p>So we have three broad concerns. First, the interpretation of what might impact on a local area&#146;s economy is too narrow. Secondly, nothing is said about what actions the strategy should inform. Thirdly, there is not enough flexibility to allow the assessment to reflect how the economy is functioning. It is not right to assume that every local authority will have its own economy&#151;that is clearly not going to be the case. Some authorities might require more than one economic assessment; others might be better off working jointly with neighbouring authorities.</p>

<p> I want to follow the hon. Lady by referring to my neck of the woods, as she has to hers. North Yorkshire has a wide range of authorities&#151;a county council, a unitary council in the shape of York itself, eight district councils and two national parks&#151;and it spreads almost coast to coast, from Bridlington, Whitby down to Hull. The concerns are clear. One crosses the plain of York, hits the Pennine range and goes towards the little bit of England that is left over, which is called Lancashire. We have Cumbria at the top left hand corner. It is practically a continent in itself. From the Pennines one can see a long way further than the Urals. [Interruption.] One can almost see Bradford.</p>
<p>If it is intended that the assessment should be county-wide, how does one bring it together? The area includes Bentham, which is in a sense dependent on Lancashire&#151;it looks towards Lancaster and that part of Lancashire&#151;and, insofar as people commute, they tend to go north or north-west. It also embraces the major population centre of York, a unitary council, and has a series of scattered districts. It has coastal areas with particular economic needs, dependent on not very high quality tourism. <span class="italic">[</span><span class="italic">Interruption.</span><span class="italic">]</span> I mean that in terms of how much people spend there; there are many day-trippers. The tourism in my constituency is not very high in that many people do not spend much money. We do not take as much money off them as we would like because they come as hikers and cyclists. <span class="italic">[</span><span class="italic">Interruption.</span><span class="italic">]</span> If the Minister looked at the speech I gave in the House a couple of weeks ago on the problems facing my constituency due to the sheer incompetence of the Learning and Skills Council and the threats to Craven college, she would understand how important it is to diversify the economy. The present tourist base needs to offer more and better, in order to attract a wider range of tourists and, quite frankly, take more money off them. That is the important point I am making.</p>
<p>First, in such a diverse area how does one draw up an economic plan or report with any real meaning? It is so diverse in character. There are, of course, similarities but there are some specific needs: agriculture, small-scale tourism&#151;I should say, rather than poor quality&#151;and small-scale manufacturing. With the exception of one or two big outfits such as the Skipton Building Society, it has relatively small-scale business. Secondly, how narrowly do we define the term &#147;economic&#148;? Do we introduce elements of sustainability? We are supposed to marry sustainability into all our ways of looking at the economy nowadays. In that case, how do we deal &nbsp;with acute issues&#151;not in my constituency, I am delighted to say, praise the Lord&#151;such as the proposal for a large incinerator? If anybody wishes to see popular democracy in action, they have only to propose that someone put an incinerator or houses anywhere near. Houses and incinerators have a particular capacity to get the entire population enraged, at least in England. In Denmark people seem to think that both of them are good ideas&#151;one is used to heat the other. In England, however, we seem to take an entirely different view. <span class="italic">[</span><span class="italic">Interruption.</span><span class="italic">]</span> In case my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe had any doubts about the direction of the economic inputs, it is the incinerator that is used to heat the house.</p>
<p>How wide does that assessment go? Does it take in issues such as skills? The real problem in North Yorkshire is not that the education quality is not good; it ought to be good given the sociology of such an area. The level of skills, however, is often not very high. One needs to be able to enhance that, which is why issues such as the future of the further education colleges are crucial in the regeneration programmes of North Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the hon. Lady mentioned an important issue: the correct geometry of the economic report. Regarding North Yorkshire, one could almost say that there is a part of what used to be North Riding that in many ways still looks north for its services. At Masham in my constituency for example, the hospital is at Northallerton, and beyond that the specialist hospitals tend to be those in Middlesbrough, on Teesside. The old West Riding of Yorkshire, which includes Ripon, which is next door to Masham, and Craven, tends to look down towards Leeds. In one of the Government&#146;s projects, the city region&#151;which I support&#151;the Leeds city region includes the district councils of Craven, Harrogate and Selby. We have already seen projects run on a city region basis, and the sensible unit for economic planning is those metropolitan areas, and the travel-to-work areas that depend on them. In many ways that is a more real economic unit than North Yorkshire. One could equally&#151;<span class="italic">[</span><span class="italic">Interruption.</span><span class="italic">]</span> The Minister shrugs her shoulders and says that it is not, but I am a supporter of a city region area, and it is. She will have her turn in a minute. I would defer to her on the affairs of Doncaster and South Yorkshire, which as far as I am concerned is almost on the M25, and I ask her to defer to my knowledge of North Yorkshire on these matters. In the north part of the county, there is a great deal of logic in a unit that is based more towards Teesside, a large part of which used to be regarded as part of Yorkshire.</p>
<p>How do these things fit together? How do we ensure that in producing an assessment on a county-wide basis we are not getting in the way of, multiplying, or having too much overlap with, assessments that might relate to more natural units? At the moment, the travel-to-work area is one of the most classic economic units for assessment right across the industrial world. I would not want to lump together artificially areas that have a natural affinity but in a geographical and sociological sense. In an economic sense, those areas do not look towards each other but towards other parts. If one takes Craven in my constituency, which is essentially&#151;</p>

<p> The right hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point about city regions. The Government&#146;s agenda has been to focus all kinds of policy and activity &nbsp;on a city region and it would make sense if the clause reflected that. However, what the clause could also do, if it were framed in that broader way, would be to allow a more rural alternative to the city regions to develop. At the moment, we have clear policy for city regions and a complete absence of policy for everything outside them.</p>

<p> The real criticism is that the Government have produced the idea of city regions but have not yet intellectually thought it through effectively. Yorkshire Forward, our regional development agency, will be responsible for a large area, and we will have a new body dealing with learning and skills issues, neither of which body is congruent with the city region, which is one of the two trial areas. Manchester and Leeds are the two trial city region areas. The Government need to be more consistent in thinking it through. If they intend to construct city regions and other bodies, perhaps they need to deconstruct, or we will have too many competing authorities and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>It may simply be that, inevitably, all wording in the Bill is a sort of shorthand and that the Minister will be able to explain it, but at the moment, I am concerned that we are doing something that appears on the surface to be eminently sensible but that is not as obviously practical when one looks a bit below the surface. I would like her reassurance on that matter.</p>

<p> I rise briefly because the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has made some interesting points, and I want to give the obverse perspective from London. Before I do so, though, I say to him that I will not be goaded by his reference, which he made knowing full well that I spent four happy days as a tourist in his area between Christmas and the new year, and I do not consider myself low-value tourism, but I will let it pass.</p>
<p>London, the principal authority defined in the legislation, is a London borough council. London has a Greater London authority, which has economic development powers created by the Greater London Authority Acts. Those powers are vested in the Mayor and the GLA. It is not clear from the legislation how far the London boroughs, in framing the individual economic assessment for their area, should take account of the wider perspective set by the London economic development strategy produced by the Mayor and the London Development Agency.</p>
<p>Clearly, that is a different position from that of authorities in other parts of the country who have no regional authorities to relate to, so there is a specific issue with London. I am not clear how the legislation is expected to work and how the potential for conflict will be avoided between the city-wide authority, which has economic development responsibilities, and the strategy developed by the individual London borough. I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend the Minister would respond.</p>

<p> This is one of the most important parts of the Bill. At the moment, particularly in the current economic downturn, all public authorities&#151;particularly local government, which I know as regional Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber&#151;are thinking clearly about their effect as authorities that &nbsp;spend a lot of money in an area, have a key role in employing up to thousands of people and whose policies can make a difference to local businesses. Placing a duty on them to make an economic assessment is vital for not only the present, but the future in terms of thinking about how they consider the particular circumstances of their area. What can they do as local authorities to support local businesses? What can they do to support local people in acquiring skills, getting training and attracting inward investment? At the moment, they occasionally play a vital role in supporting businesses and individuals who might be in particular difficulty. What we are doing in the Bill is an absolute fit with much of the current economic thinking on the role of national, regional and local government.</p>
<p>I will deal first with the points made by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne. I am quite shocked. She is, again, simply going along with Conservative Front-Bench assertions, which boil down to &#147;Let&#146;s not do anything. Let&#146;s just allow the recession to take its course.&#148; They do not believe that there is any role for intervention in the economy. That is why they have opposed what we have done at national and regional levels. Frankly, I am surprised that she is falling for that trick. That exposes the paucity of Liberal Democrat thought when it comes to implementing real policies that will help local people, including in her region.</p>
<p>The Opposition&#146;s policy is to oppose and abolish regional development agencies. The economics suggest that about 5 million people are needed in an area for an effective regional strategy to be implemented. My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich took the Bill that established regional development agencies through the legislative process. That legislation was built on a clear body of evidence on what was needed to stimulate the economy at regional level, and I think that regional development agencies have been extremely effective.</p>

<p> I assure the Minister that my views are based on facts and the experiences related to me by my constituents on the ground, rather than on the legislation before us, which is sometimes used by the Government as a proxy for action. She is about to defend regional development agencies as the drivers of economic change. I will give an example of the reason why I have defended the ability of councils to decide for themselves what is best. This week, the South West of England Regional Development Agency decided to cut back on &#163;50 million-worth of projects, a large proportion of which would have had an impact in my constituency. There is no accountability for that. Regional development agencies are failing to do even what the Government say they are doing.</p>
<p>The Minister should be careful in what she says because everybody in this room is advocating the changes that they think will have the biggest impact on the ground. We all have a duty to consider all the evidence, not just what is put forward selectively in the Bill.</p>

<p> Thank you, Mr. Illsley. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon raised an interesting point about what view the North Yorkshire councils would take of the kind of duty we are discussing. As the Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber, I have had a number of meetings with the leaders of those councils. I think that they would be pretty horrified by the idea that tourism in their area is of a poor quality. I think that those involved in &#147;Welcome to Yorkshire&#148; would be quite upset to hear that tourism in Yorkshire is considered to be substandard, or whatever the words were.</p>

<p> I do not want to again get into a 30 years war, as the French would call it. Yorkshire must ensure that its tourism is more diverse and has a greater range. The problem is that a large volume of the people who come stay in bed and breakfasts and the take is relatively small. That is why we need much better winter facilities and a wider offer: we want to take more money off the individual tourist. That is what I am talking about. If the Minister looks at the regeneration strategy based on Skipton, she will find that I am practically quoting it.</p>

<p> The right hon. Gentleman would, I hope, acknowledge that the &#163;30 million invested by Yorkshire Forward in &#147;Welcome to Yorkshire&#148; is having a huge effect on tourism. It is a good example of how such regional intervention can help to stimulate one of the key industries in our area at a very difficult time.</p>
<p>Tourism is worth something like &#163;6 billion to the Yorkshire and Humber region and employs about 250,000 people. We are trying to stimulate it through regional action. However, council leaders in North Yorkshire have been anxious to ensure that when there is an economic focus, through, for example, the city regions, they can put together an economic case for their area as well. Areas such as Scarborough and Bridlington have been what we call &#147;renaissance towns&#148; in terms of investment from Yorkshire Forward to ensure that we are getting high-quality tourism. The worry for councils is that it is important that they have their &#147;economic stamp&#148; on the plans, as well as the economic plans put forward through the city region pilots.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of support from councils of all political hues in the fight for Leeds city region to become one of the pilots. That has been welcomed. Taking an overview of Yorkshire and the Humber, it is exactly the type of action that councils are supporting. They want to play a role in economic development, but feel that consistency is needed.</p>
<p>The problem with the Conservative amendment is that it actually says. &#147;You can do it if you want to.&#148; The whole point of getting councils together and emphasising &nbsp;economic development is to ensure that they make the assessment needed to get consistency that can be fed into the overall strategy on the regional approach to stimulating the economy. That fit needs to be put together to ensure that councils, which can have a huge effect on their local economies, think clearly about what they need to do to support local businesses, support people to get jobs and help new company start-ups. I am surprised that the Opposition feel that it is better to sit back and think, &#147;Fingers crossed, let&#146;s hope something happens.&#148;</p>

<p> It is a shame that the Minister is having recourse to a tub-thumping political attack. Her argument is predicated on preparing an assessment being the same as taking action, but we have seen over the past six months that they are not the same. In fact, she is cogently making the same argument as my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe. She is giving many examples of the diversity and plurality of local authorities&#146; actions to benefit their local areas economically, socially and demographically. The clause is not needed if those things are already happening.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is missing the point about what local authorities are saying. They want notice to be taken of their local economic assessment. The provision is a way to build it into the everyday business of local authorities. That is hugely important to local people.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman talked about being over-focused on growth, but I do not think that we should deride a focus on growth. It is incredibly important that we focus on how we can stimulate the local authorities and others to help people through these difficult times, but beyond that we should think about the future, when the economic downturn is over. What will local areas look like, what skills will they need, which industries will they want to attract into their area and which will they need to help? Those questions are encompassed by introducing the duty for local authorities. I am certain that if Opposition Members talked a little more to their local councillors, they would get the same message, which is about the role that they feel they can play now to help local people.</p>

<p> I can see that, both at local level and from central Government&#146;s perspective, it is necessary to see how all the different economic experiences fit together to inform Government policy, but does the Minister not understand that if central Government dictate the shape and size of those jigsaw pieces, it undermines their ability to understand what is going on the ground? We need a bottom-up process to give central Government the best understanding of what is going on, rather than a top-down one.</p>

<p> That is exactly why we give local authorities the ability to join together through local area agreements if they wish. Some local authorities may say that in some instances it is right to widen the area covered, but in others, because of the employing &nbsp;power, the businesses in a particular local authority, colleges, schools and so on, there will be a very clear fit within the boundaries of the local authority. However, if there is desire to join together&#151;for example, through local area agreements&#151;we have said that it is for local authorities to come forward. There is flexibility within that, but within the Bill there is obviously a clear duty on the principal local authorities to do that.</p>
<p>In terms of the counties and the relationship between the counties and the districts, when drawing up any economic assessment the counties will have to consult with the districts. If the districts wish to draw up their own economic assessments, they can do so, but again that gives the flexibility to achieve what feels right within individual areas. That is an important caveat that perhaps has not been entirely clear. That perhaps addresses some of the points made by the right hon. Gentleman. Many districts within that North Yorkshire area will want to make their needs clear, especially some of those coastal areas and seaside towns.</p>

<p> I am sure the right hon. Lady understands that nobody is suggesting that local authorities are not enthusiastic about trying to address the economic needs of their areas&#151;of course they need to recognise the different needs. One thing she said is very important: the measure is not intended to be too prescriptive. My concern is not that I do not want people to take action; I simply do not want them to find themselves in a framework in which arrows are pointing in different directions. Given the importance of a sub-regional strategy, if we are now going to produce an over-layer of a county strategy, which is not inconsistent with the provision, I do not want there to be a huge problem in marrying both strategies together. In that sense, I am reassured. I discuss all this with my county councillors all the time, of course, and I will certainly discuss it with the 50-odd Conservative members, the 20-odd Liberal members and the Labour member of North Yorkshire county council.</p>

<p> As have I. I have found quite a lot of support for the idea of involving local authorities in stimulating their economies. On the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich on the GLA strategy, I assure him that the guidance will stress the need for boroughs to take account of mayoral strategies and vice versa.</p>
<p>It is important that the duty is enshrined in local authority duties. The duty is vital, now and for the future, to support local people and businesses, and it has the right amount of flexibility to ensure that, if local authorities want to join together over a wider area, they are entirely free to do so, if that is what is felt to work best locally. I hope that my arguments have absolutely persuaded the Opposition to withdraw their amendment and that they recognise the importance of the action that we are taking.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-06-09_LOCDEM_04-0_2009-06-11a.11.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" time="15:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/locdem/090611/pm/90611s07.htm#0906124000322" colnum="127">
<p> The Committee has had a wide-ranging debate in which we have considered whether the assessment of economic conditions is too narrow and whether such assessments should be more widely drawn. We did not say that it is not important to do that at a time of recession any more than the Minister said that it is not important to assess sustainability. The Committee has also considered whether the economic areas referred to &nbsp;in the clause are too narrowly drawn. We have been given two small tours by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, who raised the point, which my right hon. Friend summed up very well, about arrows pointing in different directions, and how the duty will interact with other local authority duties or assessments that are carried out in other forms.</p>
<p>The Minister&#146;s response seemed to show very little confidence in the Bill&#146;s content. I have not served opposite her for long and I do not know her modus operandi well, but she clearly feels much happier in her comfort zone attacking the Opposition for apparently doing nothing while the Government do everything, which is reflected in their successful results in the current polls. I could reply in a similar vein. We could have a little bit of party political knockabout and consider whether it is the Opposition or the Government who are doing better out of their respective political approaches at present.</p>
<p>That would be an interesting debate, but it is more relevant to state that, owing to her splendid piece of knockabout and her wielding of an enormous cudgel in the direction of Falmouth and Camborne, I am not actually sure whether the Minister has properly read the amendment or the clause. She has painted a picture of the clause as a vital part of a strategy that, to quote her, &#147;feeds into&#148; regional strategies, so that the direction of movement is clearly upwards. We understand her approach, but the clause does not state that at all. As someone pointed out during the debate&#151;I think it was the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne&#151;it only states that they &#147;must prepare an assessment.&#148; It does not say that they have to do anything with it, nor does it say that it must be fed up into the great regional strategy, of which the Minister is so proud. I am not sure that she has read her own legislation&#151;she is just much happier doing the traditional Labour thing of seeing how well it will serve them at the polls.</p>
<p>Finally, we on this side of the Committee do not propose to do nothing. All we are doing is proposing to delete the prescriptive word &#147;must&#148;&#151;it leads nowhere, because all it does is compel the local authority to create a strategy without putting anything else on the face of the Bill&#151;and insert the word &#147;may&#148;, which will allow local authorities the freedom and the flexibility to carry out the assessments for themselves. That is the clear divide in the Committee, and we intend to press our amendment to a vote.</p>

<p> In effect, we have just considered the first part of the clause. We ought, for a moment, to consider further aspects of the economic assessment, which will stand alone as a result of the clause. If members of the Committee turn their eyes to subsection (6), they will see, to their surprise, that</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;A principal local authority must have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State&#151;</p>
<p class="indent">(a) as to what an assessment under this section should contain and how it should be prepared;&#148;.</p>
<p>There is a considerable role for the Secretary of State here, as other paragraphs of the subsection make clear. If Members turn the page, they will see that before giving the guidance</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;the Secretary of State must consult&#151;</p>
<p class="indent">(a) such representatives of local government as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;.</p>
<p>It is an entirely circular process invented in the latter part of the clause, which is why we sensibly propose to leave it out. The first amendment seeks to explore that, and no doubt the Minister will tell us why non-unitary district councils should be excluded&#151;she may well have a persuasive argument to put forward.</p>
<p>Amendment 62 seeks to stress partnership. We have been here many times before. We have heard the approach from the Government side and from those on the Opposition Benches. As I have said, we have this economic assessment, which stands alone, and there are no further means on the statute book of putting the measure into effect, which seems odd&#151;although not as odd as putting it on the statute book without those means in the first place. We look forward to hearing what other members of the Committee have to say.</p>

<p> We have already outlined many of the ways in which this section will work and the need for county councils to consult district councils in drawing up an economic assessment.

However, I find it a bit odd that, to a certain extent, the Opposition are saying, &#147;You&#146;re making everybody do this assessment,&#148; but then say, &#147;Well, actually we want more people to do the assessment than is currently required under the Bill.&#148;</p>

<p> We have already talked about the need for an economic assessment to take place. I addressed that when replying to the remarks of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon about what happens in an area such as North Yorkshire where, to a certain extent, in terms of the economic assessment, there is an anxiety that if all the economic focus is around the Leeds city region, some of the more rural areas in that part of North Yorkshire will not have the same amount of attention focused on them. That is exactly why there is a duty at county council level to do so, which I believe is welcomed by those authorities. However, there is also the ability to consult, first of all, the district councils. If the district councils wish to make their own economic assessment, there is absolutely no problem with their doing so. I am finding it curious that, on the one hand, the Opposition say that they do not think that the duty should exist, but on the other hand, they want to put the duty on more councils. That is why I am a little puzzled.</p>
<p>We are also discussing amendment 63. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Wycombe addressed amendment 63 in his opening remarks.</p>

<p> I understand that amendment 63 takes away the requirement for local authorities to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Again, the issue here is that on the one hand, the Opposition want us to be more specific about exactly what the economic assessment will need to take into account, but on the other hand, they seem to want local authorities not to take any notice of that. I cannot quite marry those two positions up.</p>
<p>We wish to consult local authority bodies and others about the detail of the economic assessment and provide helpful guidance on how to draw it up. However, it is important that there is a certain level of consistency about that, so we wish to issue guidance and oppose the Opposition amendment.</p>

<p> Tomorrow, every member of the Committee will peruse the Hansard report of the debate&#151;we know that no member can get enough of the proceedings&#151;and see that the Minister clearly was not listening to my remarks when I moved the amendment, because I opened by referring to subsections (6) and (7).</p>
<p>On her point about guidance, it is perfectly true that we wish to give local authorities the freedom not to follow the guidance, but as I said in my introductory remarks, we would also remove from the Secretary of State the requirement to consult representatives of local government before the guidance is issued, thus saving everyone the circular process the Minister has invented and put in the Bill. She seems to have given us no reason not to press the amendment.</p>
<p>I heard what the Minister said in relation to amendment 61, which we tabled in a probing spirit. Were it possible for us to withdraw that amendment, but put the other two to the vote, which is at your discretion, Mr. Illsley, that is ideally what we would do.</p>

<p> Can I be clear about what the Minister said? She said that there would be guidance, but if that guidance is to embrace all the circumstances that prevail across England with regard to economic needs, it seems to me that that has to be either prescriptive, in which case it should not be done, or so flexible as to embrace every single circumstance, in which case I cannot see the point of having the guidance at all. Surely the sensible thing to do is let the units producing the guidance determine their priorities. I am sure that she will find that the danger of having some form of framework is that people will feel obliged to tick boxes that might not be relevant in their circumstances, which is bothersome.</p>

<p> I do not accept that. It is important that we can, for example, refer to the need to ensure that a local community&#146;s skills are adequate for getting jobs in local businesses or to look at the requirements with which local businesses themselves come forward. There are some good examples of the work done through skills boards in assessing local economic needs, ensuring local education is geared towards meeting those needs and, looking to the future, determining whether businesses are saying that they feel investment or skills training is needed and how that fits into an overall strategy. That must be done through consultation with organisations by local authorities. It does not have to be overly prescriptive, but it needs to set out some general areas that local authorities might wish to take into account when drawing up an economic assessment. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman knows the type of areas that are likely to be covered, but it is important that we work with local authority organisations to get their views on what will be most helpful in guidance and on what the parameters from central Government and regional government should be, which would also be helpful.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment 64, in clause 66, page 50, line 8, at end insert&#151;</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="1">&#145;( ) When conducting an assessment under this Part, a principal local authority must consider the impact on the social, environmental and economic well-being of the authority&#146;s area, including where applicable (but not limited to) the effect on ports, caused by non-domestic rating revaluations.&#146;.</p>
<p>This takes us back to the start of the debate, so I will be brief. One of the questions that we considered at the start was whether the assessment should go wider than the economy and take into account other factors, which is what this amendment states.</p>

<p> I am sympathetic with what the amendment tries to achieve, but I do not know whether it is necessary, given what the clause already sets out. Clearly, port authorities are a very important aspect of the local economy. However, given what the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has said about any council with half a brain doing certain things, I think that any council that is taking any process such as this seriously, regardless of whether or not it is required to do so, would consider the impact on its port authority, &nbsp;if it had one within its area. I am not entirely sure whether the amendment is necessary or whether the hon. Gentleman will want to press it.</p>

<p> I will match the commendable brevity of the hon. Member for Wycombe by saying that the amendment is not appropriate. Such matters, which should be addressed in local economic assessments, should not be placed in the Bill, because it would unnecessarily constrain local authorities and make it more difficult to us to respond to changing economic priorities in the future. With that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</p>
