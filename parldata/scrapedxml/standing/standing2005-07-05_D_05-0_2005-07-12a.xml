<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">(1) the Committee recommends that the programme order of the House [28th June 2005] should be amended by substituting &#039;&#039;21st July&#039;&#039; for &#039;&#039;19th July&#039;&#039;; </p>

<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown"> &#039;&#039;(3) the proceedings shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion at the time specified in the second column of the following Table. </p>
<data><table> <tr><td>TABLE</td></tr> <tr><td><i>Proceedings</i></td><td><i>Time for conclusion of proceedings</i></td></tr> <tr><td>Clauses 1 to 3,<br /> Schedule 1,<br />Clauses 4 and 5</td><td>4.05 p.m. on Tuesday 12th July</td></tr> <tr><td>Clauses 6 to 10</td><td>9.20 a.m. on Thursday 14th July</td></tr> <tr><td>Clauses 11 to 13</td><td>1.05 p.m. on Thursday 14th July</td></tr> <tr><td>Clauses 14 to 18</td><td>10.35 a.m. on Tuesday 19th July</td></tr> <tr><td>Remaining proceedings</td><td>6.00 p.m. on Thursday 21st July</td></tr> </table></data><p>This motion seeks to revise the original order, because we have somewhat reluctantly accepted that we are not making enough progress on the Bill, and there needs to be more discipline in the timetable for debates. At the start of our proceedings, we said clearly that we did not want to force the pace of debate and that all our deliberations would have to be seen in the context of the debate now being three years old. The consultation paper was issued in 2002. The Bill, or one similar to it, has been &#039;&#039;pre-leg&#039;&#039; scrutinised, if that is the appropriate phrase, and examined through all its Commons stages. We are not discussing new material. The previous Bill was dispatched in eight Committee sittings. If we were to carry on as we are now, having used 40 per cent. of the allotted time in Committee to debate two clauses, we would be here until Christmas if there were no such motion. </p>
<p>The motion will do two things. First, it will introduce two further sittings and amend the out date to 21 July. Even in the context of discussing a similar Bill in only eight sittings, there will be potential for what is essentially the same Bill to be discussed in up to 14 sittings. We are relaxed about that additional time, but we cannot use it at the lamentable pace of our deliberations thus far. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have dealt with barely two out of 45 clauses and two schedules. We have concluded debates on 35 amendments, and even including the group of amendments that we were debating when the Committee adjourned on Thursday, I reckon that we have covered 52 amendments out of a total of 211 amendments that have been tabled, leaving a further 159 amendments to be discussed. That is simply not good enough. We are happy to introduce more time formally in respect of the programme motion, but also, as I said earlier, with additional sittings at the least on Tuesdays and, if we need them, on subsequent Wednesdays. However, we can do that only if sense and discipline are brought into our deliberations. </p>
<p>Secondly, the motion will introduce knives. They will allow us to conclude our sitting this morning, having discussed the remaining elements of clause 3, schedule 1 and clauses 4 and 5. The knives will then be put in when we consider it appropriate in common with the table in the programme motion. </p>
<p>I tabled the motion merely in the interests of the Committee, and no more. The Bill is important, but it has been around the block since 2004. A similar Bill was subject to full Commons proceedings. I remind the Committee that it was dispatched in eight sittings. We are now offering up to 14 sittings for the Bill currently under discussion, but in that context, there must be knives. I commend the motion to the Committee in generous terms and in the hope that it will help to focus our deliberations and bring a bit of discipline into them; the fact that we have spent 40 per cent. of our time on two and a half clauses is not good enough, regardless of one&#039;s views of the Bill. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister for the gentle way in which he introduced the motion, but I do not agree with a word that he said. He asked for discipline. Well, Mr. Hood, I think that you and your co-Chairman, Mr. Gale, would both agree that we have not been ill-disciplined during the proceedings. There has been no interruption from a Minister or the Government Whip to say that the Opposition have been wasting time and prolonging debate for the sake of it. Although the Parliamentary Under-Secretary attempted at one stage to suggest that a wrecking amendment had been tabled, I was able to correct him with the backing of Mr. Gale. No such amendment had been tabled&mdash;and if one had, it certainly would not have been selected.</p>
<p>As far as procedure and what has appeared on the amendment paper are concerned, there can be no criticism from the Government. </p>

<p> With respect, I do not think that anyone who heard the first stage of our proceedings and the very extended discussions of different ways in which people could be dead could possibly have said that time was not being wasted.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-07-05_D_05-0_2005-07-12a.2.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" speakername="Edward Garnier" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st050712/am/50712s01.htm" colnum="151">
<p> I was certainly not dead during our first discussions and I do not remember, alive as I was, an extended discussion of how people could be dead. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s intervention is unworthy. I see that he has tabled some amendments that we will come to later in our proceedings, and I hope that we shall &nbsp; have adequate time to discuss them. I am sure that he would be most disappointed if we did not have that time.</p>
<p>The Minister said that this debate was three years old, but that is hardly the point. Lots of things of interest to the public that affect public policy and how we deal with legislation in this House are not new ideas. Very little that this Government have thought of has been a new idea, and all items of legislation, particularly at the Home Office, take time to gestate. We have to realise that this is a new Bill in a new Parliament and a new Standing Committee. We are perfectly entitled to fulfil our duties as Members of Parliament and members of this Committee to scrutinise this legislation. Although it is not incorrect for the Minister to say that this Bill is a descendant of one that has previously been discussed, that is beside the point. </p>

<p> I am grateful as a Committee member to be given the opportunity to debate this matter with the hon. and learned Gentleman, and I am grateful to him for giving way.</p>
<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman was making a point about the history of this Bill. One would hope that members of a new Committee in a new Parliament could look at both the pre-legislative scrutiny and the previous Committee proceedings, of which I was a part, take something from them and, having built on that experience, expedite proceedings now. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-07-05_D_05-0_2005-07-12a.2.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" speakername="Edward Garnier" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st050712/am/50712s01.htm" colnum="151">
<p> We have done both those things. The hon. Lady reminds me of one of her parliamentary colleagues, who turned to me in the Tea Room after the 1997 election when the Labour Government were returned with a majority of 140 or 145 seats&mdash;I cannot remember the precise figure&mdash;and said, &#039;&#039;I cannot understand why we need to have debates at all. We have just been elected with a massive majority. Our entire manifesto should simply be turned into legislation without debate.&#039;&#039; I am afraid that I nearly choked in my tea, but there we are.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-07-05_D_05-0_2005-07-12a.2.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" speakername="Mark Prisk" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st050712/am/50712s01.htm" colnum="151">
<p> It may sound immodest to say so, but there are two new Conservative Committee members, and colleagues from other parties have not had their chance to debate the issues. Why should those hon. Members simply read what others have said in debates, as the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) suggested? Are they not here to debate these matters for themselves?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-07-05_D_05-0_2005-07-12a.2.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" speakername="Edward Garnier" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st050712/am/50712s01.htm" colnum="152">
<p> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. It is deeply boring to be a Member of the Government party in Committee, because such Members are not encouraged to intervene. The hon. Member for Colne Valley is an exception; she has been a hugely interesting contributor to our debates, as my hon. Friends will agree. No doubt she will wish to intervene on many other occasions, particularly to scrutinise the &nbsp; detail of the legislation and cross-examine the Ministers as they seek to advance the Government&#039;s policy. I look forward to hearing her, knives or no knives.</p>
<p>The Minister said that we had used 40 per cent. of our time dealing with not quite three clauses, and he is right. I am afraid that that is not our fault, however, but that of the Government. They decided the timetable, and we are merely creatures of that; we must operate within the timetable that they set. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-07-05_D_05-0_2005-07-12a.2.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st050712/am/50712s02.htm" colnum="152">
<p> I have a minor correction to make: the timetable has been agreed through the usual channels. It is not a Government-imposed timetable. The usual channels agreed 10 sittings and that is the end of the story.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-07-05_D_05-0_2005-07-12a.2.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" speakername="Edward Garnier" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st050712/am/50712s02.htm" colnum="152">
<p> Far be it for me to suggest that the Minister is misleading himself, but that line was attempted on Second Reading. My right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary made it clear in an intervention on his opposite number&mdash;I cannot remember whether it was made at the Dispatch Box or from a sedentary position, but I was next to him at the time&mdash;that there is no such agreement. We all know what the phrase &#039;&#039;the usual channels&#039;&#039; means. It means that the Government say, &#039;&#039;This is what we are doing. Take it or leave it&#039;&#039;, and we simply have to do what the Government insist.</p>
<p> Let us not be naïve about this: the Government control the agenda of the House of Commons. The Executive sit in, and on, the House of Commons. I do not complain about that. When we are in government we will no doubt do things that are deeply disobliging to the Labour Opposition. Right now, I am in the Opposition and Labour Members are in government. They have to make the case for the extension or restriction of the time that we have to debate this issue&mdash;end of story. We have used 40 per cent. of the time that the Government suggested to Parliament that we should have. That is fair enough. However, that is their problem and they have been hoist by their own petard. </p>
<p> The Government have a choice. They could allow the Bill to be debated properly and to receive the proper scrutiny that it deserves. That may mean that we run beyond the end of the summer term. There is no problem with that, because this is an enabling Bill, which provides for 60 regulations to be made by the Secretary of State, and in practice the consequences of its enactment cannot take effect until 2007&ndash;08. As I understand it, nothing in the Bill will happen for a good many years yet. There is no particular hurry to rush the Bill through its Committee stage by the end of the summer term. </p>
<p>In any event, the Government are hoist by their own petard. They could face up to the fact that the Bill, as knifed and guillotined, will not have received proper debate. We might be out of Committee by 21 July&mdash;I make no complaint about the extra day&mdash;having, in the Government&#039;s words, considered every clause and every schedule. However, we know that the reality is that we shall not have done so. Alternatively, we could stick to the 21 July date and face the reality of getting only halfway through the Bill. The &nbsp; Government can choose between one unsatisfactory outcome and another. They cannot claim on 21 July or when we get back to Report in October that the Bill has been properly scrutinised in Committee. Making such a claim would be presenting an entirely false case. They must realise that that is the fact of the matter. </p>

<p> The hon. Lady might be a new Member, but she does not advance a new argument. I assure her that if she serves on many other Committees, she will find that the Government find debate inconvenient. It is not unusual for Government Members to say, &#039;&#039;Rather than complaining about the knives and the guillotine, wouldn&#039;t it be a better idea just to get on with the debate?&#039;&#039; I assure her that in a Bill with 45 clauses and two schedules, taking half an hour to expose the weakness of the Government&#039;s case on the knifing and guillotining policy is time well spent. It may be inconvenient, and I am sorry about that.</p>
<p>Judging by the hon. Lady&#039;s contribution to the previous few sittings, I expect that she is itching to say just as much over the next few. I apologise to her, but my job is not to please the Government or her; it is to do what I can to improve the legislation, to ensure that it is properly scrutinised and to defend the rights of Parliament against the Executive. </p>
<p>The Minister told us that his motion was in the Committee&#039;s interests. Frankly, that is a secondary point. The question of what is in the interests of good legislation and of the general public whom we represent in this House is a primary point. I am unconvinced that the knives will achieve anything other than butchered scrutiny that produces inept legislation. Although I am delighted that we can sit on 21 July, I fear that the Government have wholly mismanaged the Bill&#039;s programme and that when it leaves Committee we will be dissatisfied because we as parliamentarians will not have done a good job for our constituents. </p>

<p> I wonder whether I am the only Committee member who finds the hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s description of the usual channels so profoundly depressing. If I understood him correctly, he told us that the function of the usual channels was to ensure that the Government got their own way all the time, and that that was all right because if the Conservatives were in government they would do the same. That suggests that our purpose is not to engage in proper argument but merely to rehearse positions determined only by which political side we are on. Although the &nbsp; hon. and learned Gentleman might be right about that, it was depressing to hear.</p>
<p>We have not made dramatic progress with this legislation. That is because the meat of the Bill is in the first three clauses&mdash;in the creation of the database, and the construction of information that will be registrable. The time that we have spent on the consideration of those clauses has not been time wasted. That goes to the heart of my concern about the timetable motion. I am worried about the inclusion of knives. If we had started off with a timetable motion that included knives, we would not have had some of the useful debates that we have had. A good example of that is the debate that was had on rebuttable or conclusive presumptions; it was a classic of the Committee debate genre, and, because of when it occurred, I suspect that it would not have taken place because the knife would have fallen at a much earlier stage. </p>
<p>I am grateful to the Government for making extra time available; that is necessary. However, unfortunately, I will be unable to support the timetable motion because of the inclusion of the knives; as a matter of principle, I believe that they are not helpful or conducive to good debate. </p>

<p> I had no intention of speaking. In common with many Labour Committee members, I wish to speak to other clauses, and if we were to continue in the current way I would be unable to speak to some of them. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) might be picking sides, but I am here to represent my constituents and the people of the country, and to speak for those who cannot speak here today. In my own humble way, I want to look after people who have a disability, or are elderly, or who might not be able to understand what is happening in respect of this Bill today. That is my job. The hon. Gentleman might think that I have chosen a side, but I happen to be a member of the Labour party and I am here to speak for those people. I take great exception to someone saying that I do not do so.</p>
<p>We have discussed this matter before. I sat on the Committee that dealt with the previous Bill, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley. The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) was a victim of his own Front-Bench colleagues in debates on that earlier Bill, when they proceeded in countless sittings to discuss the same clauses that we have spoken on so far in this Committee. I feel sorry for the hon. Gentleman; it appears that his colleagues are doing the same thing to him. </p>
<p>I and other Members wish to speak on other clauses, and I fear that, if we introduce knives, discussion of them might be cut out. However, the Bill should be dealt with in the period that we want; it is important for this country to get the legislation on to the statute book. I blame Opposition members for the waste of time. I want them to go and look at themselves in the mirror and realise what they may have done to people who need our representation today. It is all very well for the Opposition to turn around and blame the Government for everything, and to blame our Front Bench for introducing these &nbsp; measures, but if the Opposition had treated the arguments properly, and had made their points and speeches succinctly, this programme motion would not be before us today. </p>

<p> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments, which clearly come from the heart, and for the sympathy that he expresses; I can see that it is quickly turning into empathy.</p>
<p>I suffered throughout the previous consideration of the Bill, and I take exception to the Minister&#039;s comments about lack of discipline. If he thinks that he sees lack of discipline here, what on earth did he see during the Bill&#039;s previous passage through Committee? Then, there were constant interventions from all parties. Those in the Chair had to make the point very clearly that we were digressing and I seem to remember the Minister&#039;s predecessor making a speech that went on for one hour and forty-something minutes&mdash;a very lengthy speech that was probably not necessary. Certainly, the Minister is speaking very far from the point when he complains about a lack of discipline. </p>
<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) touched on an important point: we are here not necessarily&mdash;and certainly not first of all&mdash;to represent our parties. We are here to represent the people who elected us. The hon. Gentleman feels strongly, as he should do, about people with disabilities and those who will have physical difficulty complying with the Bill, but there are so many other considerations. I feel desperately strongly about clause 8, for instance. The workings of the card itself are something that I wish to debate in detail. </p>
<p>So far, we have talked at length about the register. That is fine, but that is a completely separate and discrete argument from that on the issue of the cards. I have heard so many Members on the Labour Benches tell me how much support the register and cards enjoy among their constituents. The hon. Member for Colne Valley spoke extremely lucidly last week about the expressions of sympathy for the issue in south Yorkshire. However, I am afraid that I cannot reflect such a feeling in north Nottinghamshire. Perhaps we both live in bubbles and are inured to the true feeling of our constituents; I do not know. But I would like the opportunity to discuss what my constituents feel about the subject, and the fact that they do not wish to pay perhaps several hundred pounds&mdash;let us find out the exact amount in debate&mdash;for the cards. </p>
<p>That is why I do not want knives to be introduced, and why I wish to continue using disciplined debate to find out about those things that affect our constituents deeply. I resent the use of knives, and the fact that I and many other hon. Members sat here during the previous Committee sittings hearing flannel and tosh talked by a number of people. That actually prevented us from talking about the important issues. I do not believe that anything that we have said so far is ill disciplined or improper. We may have been able to indulge in a certain amount of light-heartedness&mdash;I think that that is good&mdash;but the fact remains that the events of last week add a new focus to the Bill. Those events give us a duty to remember exactly where that focus lies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I welcome the additional time that the Government have given us, but as for the idea of introducing knives to our proceedings, if parts of the Bill go undebated, we are mis-serving not just our constituents but our country. </p>

<p> I shall try to keep my remarks especially brief if we are to get through the debate on the motion in the time specified.</p>
<p>I take what the hon. Gentleman says at face value, but it is fair to say that although the role of the Opposition is to oppose, it is also to understand the mood of the House. It is very difficult to understand the mood of the House. It is fair to say that I have some misgivings about some parts of the Bill, but Committee members may never hear those; we shall never get through to them unless there is some discipline among the Opposition. </p>
<p>I hope that the Opposition will see the value of the knives so that we can get through this Bill and hear from both sides of the House. I shall try to represent the views and misgivings of Labour Members. So far there has been no chance to do so because we have taken so long to go such a little way along the path of getting through the Bill. I hope that we shall speed up a little bit; then, perhaps, the knives will be unnecessary. However, unless the Opposition hear very clearly what is now being said, I fear that our path will be slow and rocky. There should be a lot more discipline on all sides. </p>

<p> I shall be brief, Mr. Hood. I was not on the last Committee and could not contribute to the debate on the ID card when the issue was initially introduced. I did not have the honour of hearing the hon. Member for Colne Valley during the previous Committee. However, it is important that this time there are three Committee members with counter-terrorism experience; one was on the previous Committee, but two were not. We also have with us a very learned Member who understands the law and how it works in court.</p>
<p>Yes, our discussions have taken time, but some clauses at the beginning of the Bill are more important than some later ones, so why should they not be debated at length as they come up so that their importance is reflected? So far, during all the hours of discussion about which the Government complain, how many points have they conceded? How many points have they listened to and done something about? Not one&mdash;they have dismissed them as if they counted for nothing, although many people have strong feelings about them. </p>
<p>I apologise that I was not here earlier, but I had to wait for a Labour Member to step aside to allow me to attend the Committee in the new Parliament. There are people with experience who have points to contribute, and introducing knives to the Committee will damage that process. Let us remember that the Government could put a programme motion before the House and ask for consideration to span the recess. That is in their power, but I wonder whether Labour Committee members will support that. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that, although we can have discussions and points can be made, there is no point in having five inputs from his side, all saying the same thing but involving a different story?</p>

<p> Given what the hon. Gentleman has said, perhaps we should have just one Conservative Committee member to make our arguments. Would that be more convenient for the Government? We can glance around the Room and see how many Labour Committee members have been eager to contribute with amendments. I cannot see many amendments tabled by them on the amendment paper, although I know that a few would like to make proposals.</p>
<p>We look forward to some of those amendments, including that of the hon. Gentleman, but he should understand that although his amendment comes later, it may be as important as the amendments that we tabled on clauses at the beginning of the Bill. Therefore, I do not think that knives are constructive in this debate, nor, given the impact of ID cards, will it benefit any of us to rush this through. </p>

<p> I was drawing my remarks to a close at the end of the last sitting. It is important that the Committee recognise that amendment No. 34 is intended to tie down the Government on the purpose of the Bill. It was said that the database will be used to verify the identity of an individual presenting an ID card and that it will exist for that purpose alone. It will carry a certain amount of information, as described in clause 1, but it will also hold footprint information on credit reference and so forth. That will show the pattern of people&#039;s lives and behaviour in a way that goes beyond the purpose of the register according to how the Government originally introduced it.</p>
<p>The Minister said that only in limited circumstances will certain organisations or agencies be allowed to look at that extra footprint information. He assured us that they will not be allowed to browse through that information, but nothing in the Bill, or in the other relevant Acts that I have looked at, prescribes that focused purpose of those agencies by telling them, &#039;&#039;You can&#039;t browse through that information, but you must request it only on very specific issues.&#039;&#039; Such a statement does not exist; that is in the gift of the Home Secretary. </p>
<p>Clause 19, which addresses the other allowed uses of the register, says that the </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;provision of information is authorised by this section where it is&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>to &#039;&#039;the Security Service&#039;&#039;, the &#039;&#039;Secret Intelligence Service&#039;&#039;, GCHQ and the &#039;&#039;Serious Organised Crime Agency&#039;&#039;. They will be allowed to look through the information if that is for the purposes of their function. </p>
<p>It is important to cross-reference with the Security Service Act 1989 to discover what is the purpose of the Security Service. Section 1 of that Act was amended in 1996, but subsection (3), which was not amended, states: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;It shall also be the function of the Service to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>That is a very general description. When the Labour party was in opposition, I remember that it accused the security services of using that function so as to listen to and monitor strike leaders during the miners&#039; strike. I say to Members with misgivings that that Act and this Bill authorise the security services to look at information relevant under paragraph 9 of schedule 1. That is one of the functions provided. </p>
<p>Let us consider GCHQ&#039;s functions, as described in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. Section 3(1)(a) states that one of its function is </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;to monitor or interfere with electromagnetic, acoustic and other emissions and any equipment producing such emissions and to &nbsp;obtain and provide information derived from or related to such emissions or equipment and from encrypted material&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>The point I am making is that those functions are widely drawn in these Acts. Therefore, a powerful individual in the guise of the Home Secretary is involved with the security services. He has the ability to authorise people to look at the information. In some cases, he is almost prevented from stopping them looking at it because they are allowed to do so by the very nature of the Acts that put them in place&mdash;the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Security Service Act 1989. </p>
<p> Therefore, if the Minister wants to put safeguards on the information, the best way to do so might be to remove the footprint purpose of the register&mdash;to remove it recording all the questions put to it&mdash;such that it still serves its purpose and still verifies the individual and their card against the database. Alternatively, he could come to this Committee or to the House with more detail on the times when he will allow those agencies or public authorities mentioned in clause 19 access to that information. </p>
<p>When, exactly, can those organisations have the information? I am not talking in terms of each case or just their general function. I am asking for what purpose, and when, can they do that. This should be done to safeguard people&#039;s civil liberties in that environment and to allow them to understand the situation. The Minister could add to the list limited circumstances in which other people will also be able to have access to the information. </p>
<p>This issue is the crux of the matter, which is why it is important to spend time on it. We are moving from the database being used for verification to its holding more than that. It will hold data on people&#039;s behaviour, traits and pattern. The Minister might want to come forward and say, &#039;&#039;No, we need it because it is about counter-terrorism. We make advantage from it.&#039;&#039; However, he should make that case, not hide it behind the central database of a register for verification. It is more than that. This is where the concerns about civil liberties lie. </p>

<p> Let me deal first with the lead amendment. I will then address some of, but not all, the subsequent amendments. Clause 3(4) provides that information</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;may continue to be recorded in the Register for so long as it is consistent with the statutory purposes for it to be so recorded.&#039;&#039; </p>
<p>Amendment No. 22, which we dealt with some time ago, would take out the words &#039;&#039;consistent with&#039;&#039; and replace them with the words &#039;&#039;necessary for&#039;&#039;. Clause 3(6) empowers the Secretary of State to make an order adding to the information that may be recorded on the register where he considers, again, that it will be &#039;&#039;consistent with&#039;&#039; the statutory purposes to do so. Amendment No. 23 would change that test to one of &#039;&#039;necessary for&#039;&#039; statutory purposes. </p>
<p> One can only assume that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) is of the view that the amendments would impose a higher test than the one that is in the Bill for the retention of existing information and the addition of further information. &nbsp; One also assumes that he seeks consistency with the fifth data protection principle, which states: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>The second of the two statutory purposes&mdash;we always return to those&mdash;is in clause 1(3)(b). It is to provide </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;a secure and reliable method for registrable facts about . . . individuals to be ascertained or verified wherever that is necessary in the public interest.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>The test in clause 3 of &#039;&#039;consistent with&#039;&#039; the statutory purposes must therefore be read in the light of the necessity test that is built into the statutory purposes. The net result provides no less protection than would a double necessity test. Furthermore, it is not inconsistent with the fifth data protection principle. </p>
<p> In other words, as I have said on previous occasions, one always has to return to the building blocks that permeate clauses 1, 2 and 3. The necessity test that the hon. and learned Gentleman seeks is in clause 1(3) rather than in clause 3. </p>
<p>Amendment No. 26, tabled by the hon. and learned Gentleman, would require a super-affirmative resolution for any orders amending schedule 1, whether they added or removed information. Amendments Nos. 130, 131 and 132, tabled by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, would require further primary legislation if the schedule ever needed modification, as they would remove the possibility of modifying the schedule by secondary legislation. </p>
<p>Two further amendments, Nos. 24 and 188, would make any orders either adding information to or removing it from the schedule subject to affirmative orders. That would not be an effective use of parliamentary time. There is already suitable scrutiny to safeguard people&#039;s privacy with a balance of negative and affirmative resolution procedures and the requirement that information may be added only if it is consistent with the statutory purposes. </p>
<p>The statutory purposes are not there for fun or just to make the Bill&#039;s first three clauses consistent. They are a real test and everything that flows from them needs to be seen in that regard. We shall resist those initial amendments. Although I understand where they are coming from, we do not agree with them. </p>
<p>As for the footprint&mdash;the tail end of paragraph 9 of schedule 1&mdash;I do not agree with much of what was said by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace). With due apology, he was again using sloppy language. He talked about a credit reference. There will be no record on the database of someone applying for a credit reference. As paragraph 9 states, entries will record when there has been an attempt to verify. The hon. Gentleman talked about identifying people&#039;s traits and other elements. </p>
<p>Mr. Wallace rose&mdash;</p>

<p> I shall not give way for the moment. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument is simply hot air and not sustained by the Bill in its language. His other &nbsp; points about previous legislation are not terribly relevant because the Bill must be seen in the context of the statutory purposes that I have outlined. For all that he said about prior Acts of Parliament that establish security services or otherwise and that bring them into the open, that does not matter other than in the context of the statutory purposes under the Bill.</p>
<p>I am sure that what I am about to say is the wrong interpretation of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument, but it could really be about trying to limit the efficacy and efficiency of those services. I am sure that that is not what he wants to do. Functions are widely drawn deliberately because of the task and functions that we ask those services to undertake, and that is entirely appropriate. </p>

<p> Of course, I concede the credit reference point, but I want to refer to the footprint made each time people present information for a public service, which they are required to produce, and when they are stopped by the police, register with a GP or attend a hospital and have their details verified. Each time a Minister changes which public services require identification to be established before a service is delivered and the remit widens, the footprint will be there.</p>

<p> At the risk of boring the Committee, I must pull the hon. Gentleman up on his language again. Nowhere in the Bill is there a provision to be stopped by the police. So will he please not use language or ascribe provisions to the Bill that simply do not exist? Earlier, the hon. Gentleman said that the security services could look through the register. Again, that is not strictly correct. The Bill does not allow anyone to look through the register. We must get our language right.</p>
<p>The powers under clause 9 will provide information to the security and intelligence services when they request it from the register. It is like any other element in the verification process. There is not licence in the Bill for anyone to browse, fish or go through the register at length or in any way, shape or form. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will desist from using poorly informed examples or sloppy language to ascribe matters to the Bill that are simply not there. </p>

<p> There is. Perhaps the Minister was being sloppy in his language by leaving out &#039;&#039;in line with their functions&#039;&#039;. The Acts that set out functions, to which I have alluded, allow the security services to request the information in line with their functions. The functions are not specific, so the request could be in line with the function, so it will be order for the Secretary of State to request all information on individuals in a certain part of London. That will be in line with the functions. We could argue about whether that was browsing, focusing or whatever, but it is in line with their functions. The Minister left out &#039;&#039;in line with their functions&#039;&#039;.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-07-05_D_05-0_2005-07-12a.4.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" time="11:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st050712/am/50712s04.htm" colnum="163">
<p> That is actually the next line on my bit of paper, but that is by the by. We could not, by any terms, say that the provision allowed browsing. When the hon. Gentleman referred to earlier legislation, I said very clearly that we were putting &nbsp; on a legislative footing that which was not on such a footing before&mdash;that is, the provisions relating to the security services. Everything in the Bill stems from clause 1, so whatever any other legislation says when ascribing functions to the security services&mdash;or any other organisation, state or otherwise&mdash;all that they can do in relation to the register is in the context of the statutory purposes of the Bill. That is the reference point: those statutory purposes, not any legislation that created an organisation in the first place. Everything in the Bill flows from statutory purposes.</p>
<p>As I was saying before I allowed the hon. Gentleman to intervene, the powers in clause 19 are to provide information. They are not a licence to go fishing or browsing; they are to provide information to the security and intelligence services when they request any information from the register that is needed to carry out the agency&#039;s functions&mdash;so, yes, he is right there&mdash;in terms of the statutory purposes of the Bill, and no more. It says that on the face of the Bill, right at the start. Clause 1 says what the Bill is about. All the powers and functions in the other 44 clauses that flow from clause 1 stem from statutory purposes. </p>
<p>Two things can happen in Committee: someone alights on a clause and does not read it in the context of the overall Bill&mdash;an easy mistake for any Member to make, experienced or otherwise&mdash;or someone alights on a reference from another piece of legislation, and looks at the Bill in the context of the old legislation and does not see the wider picture involving the new legislation. There is no facility in the Bill to allow police to stop people and ask for the production of their ID card, and there is certainly no licence for anyone to go fishing or browsing in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman. </p>
<p>To dwell on what was said on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I take the points made about affirmative versus negative procedure, super-affirmative procedure, and using primary legislation rather than anything else to alter schedule 1, but I simply do not agree. </p>

<p> Before the Minister moves on to my amendment, and following on from the point raised by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, the Minister is right that there is no power to browse the register, but he must be aware that it is quite possible that, with a minimum of information, the security services could undertake a fishing expedition. I draw a parallel with the granting of warrants. In order to get a warrant for the security services to search a house, reasonable grounds for seeking the warrant have to be shown. Where is the &#039;&#039;reasonable grounds&#039;&#039; protection in this Bill? Who makes sure that the security services, or indeed any other service, is not using the power to obtain information without proper cause?</p>

<p> In the first instance, the Secretary of State, as I understand it. But if that is not the case, I shall certainly come back on the issue.</p>
<p>I accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s points about process and how to change schedule 1, but I simply do not agree with them. We think that schedule 1 is fairly comprehensive, and do not want to add or take away &nbsp; from it. In light of all the other safeguards in the Bill&mdash;again, it should be seen simply in its own terms&mdash;we think that the procedures in place at secondary level are appropriate. </p>
<p>On the necessity test that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough seeks under amendments Nos. 22 and 23, we argue that that is simply unnecessary, because clause 1 talks about what is necessary for the statutory purposes. That, and the point that we made about &#039;&#039;consistent with&#039;&#039;, is the appropriate double lock that he seeks, rather than pursuing amendments Nos. 22 and 23. In that context, I ask him to withdraw his amendment. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister for his arguments, but he has not wholly satisfied me. I fear that quite a lot needs to be done to reassure Conservative Committee members that what we have argued for is incorrect, mistaken or generally misplaced.</p>
<p>I shall start by paraphrasing a remark made by the Minister just now. He said that there was no power in the Bill to allow the police to stop people and demand their identity cards. That is broadly what he said, although I make it clear that I am not using his exact words. He is entirely right. If you look through the Bill from clause 1 to clause 45, Mr. Hood, you will not find any power given to a police officer to stop someone in the street and demand his identity card. </p>
<p>However, that police officer would not be using the Identity Cards Act to do that, but other Acts of Parliament that this Government have passed during the past few years, and possibly the common law. He will stop someone and ask, &#039;&#039;What are you up to? I have a reasonable belief that you are carrying drugs and that you are a criminal of some sort.&#039;&#039; He will then ask, &#039;&#039;Have you got your identity card on you? If you can show me that, I may be the better satisfied as to your bone fides.&#039;&#039; </p>
<p>Let us not fool ourselves that this Bill provides the police with the power to stop and search; it does not need to. However, what we have been arguing and suggesting is that the Bill provides an excuse&mdash;a pretext&mdash;for the identity card and the information contained in the register that underlies it to become part of a routine process. That is not only access creep, but function creep, and the Government need to understand that we are concerned about that. </p>

<p> Clause 18(1)(b) states that it is unlawful for any person</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;to make it a condition of doing anything in relation to an individual that the individual establishes his identity by the production of an ID card&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>It would therefore be unlawful for an officer to say, &#039;&#039;I will look on your behaviour more favourably if you can show me an ID card.&#039;&#039; </p>

<p>He needs to bear that in mind. He may honestly and genuinely believe in what he says, but if he does, I think him naive. If he thinks that the police will not &nbsp; make use of the identity card system and the data register to help them to be useful to the public&mdash; </p>

<p> I apologise, Mr. Hood, for having made an intervention in that way.</p>
<p>A moment ago, the hon. and learned Gentleman questioned whether we had any interest in making the register and the cards useful to the police. I refer him to clause 1(4)(b), which states that the Bill is </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;for the purposes of the prevention or detection of crime&#039;&#039;.</p>

<p> Of course they will be useful to the police. That is why the police will use the pretext.</p>
<p>The two Ministers need to have a chat outside. On the one hand, the Minister of State says that there is no power in the Bill that allows the police to stop and search to check identity and so forth; that is a paraphrase, not his exact words.

<p> I am afraid that I did not say that. The hon. and learned Gentleman made a general statement about our intention to make these systems useful to the police to help them in their job. I referred him back to clause 1, which says that the scheme is about</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;the prevention or detection of crime&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>That is entirely different from saying that the police will be given powers across the board to stop and search, and to demand production of a person&#039;s identity card. I hope that he understands that distinction. </p>

<p> Perhaps we are having a conversation at cross purposes. I agree with the Minister of State that there is no power in the Bill to allow the police to stop people and say, &#039;&#039;Let&#039;s see your identity card&#039;&#039;. That may yet come; we have not seen what the 60 regulations will say.</p>
<p>The argument I am making to the Committee simply flows from the Under-Secretary&#039;s sedentary &nbsp; intervention, &#039;&#039;Why not? What&#039;s wrong with that?&#039;&#039; This system will create a pretext for the police to stop people who currently are allowed to walk across the street without having to demonstrate who they are and that they have an innocent purpose. Of course, they will not say, &#039;&#039;I am stopping you because I have a power under the Identity Cards Bill.&#039;&#039; They will say, &#039;&#039;I am stopping you because I have the reasonable excuse that you are a criminal.&#039;&#039; That may coincide with one of the statutory purposes, but let us not fool ourselves: the Bill, if enacted, will, by virtue of clause 1 and all the other clauses that we have discussed, lead to function creep and to access creep into the register. </p>
<p>The Minister may have a fond hope that that is simply not true, but I predict that over the next 10 or so years there will be a measurable increase in police activity as a consequence of the Bill. They will rely upon things such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, the common law, the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and the various anti-terrorist legislation that we have passed&mdash;or will pass&mdash;this year.

<p> I would never say that I am having my time wasted by Ministers, because I admire all that they have to do as Ministers of the Crown. If interrupting me is what they wish to do, I am here to be intervened on.</p>
<p>The hon. Members for Orkney and Shetland and for Stroud (Mr. Drew), whose admonition during the earlier debate I accept, were far from convinced in relation to how they anticipated their arguments being dealt with. I believe that the hon. Member for Stroud was correct when he expressed, before we resumed this morning, his concerns about the width of schedule 1. I am not sure that he has received any words of comfort in response to his request for closer definitions in schedule 1. </p>
<p> The hon. Members for Colne Valley and for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) have intervened both today and in the earlier debate. I am grateful to them for doing so, because it has helped us to tease out some &nbsp; points that it was necessary to tease out. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre has made a significant contribution to our debate on this aspect of the Bill. </p>
<p>I want to make it clear that in calling for a Division on amendment No. 22, I am using it simply as a device by which I can express my opinion&mdash;or ask the Committee to express its opinion&mdash;about some subsequent amendments relating to clause 3. I accept that amendment No. 22 is not the be-all and end-all of our debate; it just happens to be the first amendment in the group. So, I want the Government to understand that when I press it to a Division, I will be using it to introduce a Division on some more important subsequent amendments that we have discussed. </p>

<p> Clause 4 deals with the designation of documents for the purposes of registration and other unspecified purposes. Amendments Nos. 206 and 207 &nbsp; would affect subsection (2). At the moment, the clause reads:</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;(1) The Secretary of State may by order designate a description of documents for the purposes of this Act. </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">(2) The only documents that may be the subject of an order designating a description of documents for the purposes of this Act are&mdash; </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown"> (a) documents that a person has a power or duty to issue by virtue of provision made by or under an enactment; or </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown"> (b) documents which a Minister of the Crown or Northern Ireland department is authorised or required to issue otherwise than by virtue of provision so made.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>Subsection (3) deals with the manner in which the orders are to be made. </p>
<p>I wish to register my usual complaint about the powers given to the Secretary of State to make orders that we have not yet seen. I shall bank that argument as one that will recur, which it does with particular force under the clause. What documents under subsection (2) do the Government have in mind? What is their description? What is their category or class? It would be useful to know what the Government are thinking. Short of compulsion, the principal means of creating an incentive to register is through designated documents, so the definition of which documents may be designated needs to be tied down. </p>
<p>At present, the category of documents is so broad or undefined that it could refer to a television licence, a fishing licence or another sort of promissory licence. Which documents will a person have the power or duty to issue by virtue of a provision under an enactment? What Acts will be involved? What earlier provisions define the category of document? </p>
<p>The question that must follow is which parties, be they human beings or institutions of the state, or perhaps not of the state, will have the power or duty to issue the documents? Do the Government intend the statutory order that will come into force at some stage&mdash;we know not when&mdash;to give power to local authorities, quangos or private organisations to introduce themselves to the identity card system by becoming issuers of documents that will then be designated for the purposes of registration? </p>
<p>It follows that amendment No. 207, which would delete the words </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;otherwise than by virtue of provision so made&#039;&#039; </p>
<p>under subsection (2)(b), must go if the Committee accepts my arguments about subsection (2)(a). It is one thing to have a Secretary of State designating through an unknown statutory instrument particular documents as coming within the necessary category, but quite another for unknown people or institutions to have that power over unknown documents. I urge the Minister to help me to understand what he is about. </p>

<p> I wish to follow on from what my hon. and learned Friend has said. I am worried about the width and breadth of the unknown documents under clause 4. I am worried especially about the ability of local authorities to introduce documents, given the provisions of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. It is now more understandable how that the &nbsp; provisions of the Act might be enacted in national emergencies. Given what happened recently, it is much clearer how, in the event of a catastrophe occurring in a discrete part of the world, local authorities might suddenly be given much greater powers and that they might wish to introduce documents to assist them with identity and the general clear-up in the aftermath of a disaster that might then be considered documents to be designated for the purposes of registration. I would be grateful if the Minister cleared that point up for me. I hope that it is not too abstruse; I think it important, given our lengthy deliberations during the passage of the Civil Contingencies Bill, and also given how the subsequent Act might affect those documents.</p>

<p> I seek further clarification from the Minister on the relationship between clauses 3 and 4, and therefore on schedule 1. As I said in the previous debate, schedule 1 is far too widely drawn. What documents that could form a constituent part of the register are we expecting the ordinary person to bring forward?</p>
<p>Without trying to rerun the previous debate, I should say that there is one issue about what is on the register and a second about how people are asked to add to what is on the register. Later, we shall no doubt consider how people might take things off the register. However, I wish to get much greater clarification on the relationship of those different parts of the legislation, and, dare I say it, to chide the Minister. </p>
<p>We are making things terribly and unnecessarily complicated. As I said, I have a problem not with the principle of ID cards, but with the practice. If I read clause 4 correctly, it puts the onus on the individual to provide more and more information that could then go on the register. Will the Minister at least clarify why that is necessary? Why can we not simplify the process so that people can bring forward documents, as they do in banks? Banks, however, are unduly complicated in asking for a number of pieces of information. If we had ID cards, banks might benefit from a simplification of that process. </p>
<p>To me, clause 4 is ladling it on thick and needs to be streamlined. If we had had a vote on schedule 1, we might have been able to do some of that streamlining. Clause 4 is overcomplicated and needs clarification. </p>

<p> May I start by responding to the contribution from my hon. Friend? Absolutely nothing in clause 4 adds any documentation or data to those already predefined in schedule 1. Clause 4 is about the mechanism for individuals to apply for an ID card when applying for a designated document, and no more than that. It is, if I may put it this way, the piggy-back clause that says, as we have said time and again, that we will start implementing this system by adding ID cards as part of a package when people receive biometric passports from 2008 onwards.</p>
<p>We can do that only if, via clause 4, the biometric passport is designated as an appropriate document to hook up with the ID card. This is not about building a system that would introduce an entirely stand-alone ID card system. That might be perfectly appropriate, &nbsp; but we have decided that it is not the way we want to go. However, I repeat that clause 4 bears no relation to adding to, subtracting from or doing anything to what is already predefined in schedule 1. I give my hon. Friend that assurance. </p>

<p> As we have said elsewhere, that is our additional intention. What I was about to say&mdash;at the risk of boring the Committee&mdash;was that this is enabling legislation. There may well be other more appropriate documents that could equally be so designated and form part of the implementation of the scheme. The issue has been debated, and it might well be the case that driving licences are another appropriate designated document that can assist in the implementation of the scheme. We are not simply saying, &#039;&#039;Here is a national register and here are the parameters for an ID card associated with that register; it will be introduced only on the back of the introduction of the second-generation biometric passports from 2008 onwards.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>We have said elsewhere, outwith the legislation, that this is the way in which we are minded to go. We want to draw it as broadly as possible, and that is deliberate because there might well be other routes. When the time comes for substantive implementation of the scheme, there might be provision for the issue of stand-alone ID cards&mdash;for example where, even if both driving licences and passports were designated documents, someone, for perfectly valid reasons, were never in their life to want either of those documents. Therefore, I make no apologies for this being drawn broadly. </p>
<p>Let me put this matter in context. Clause 4(2) is drafted in such a way as to cover two different types of document that we might wish to designate. Subsection (2)(a) covers any document issued under an enactment. That would allow us to include documents such as residents permits issued under immigration powers to foreign nationals, or&mdash;the point we were just debating&mdash;driving licences issued under the Road Traffic Acts. Subsection (2)(b) covers documents issued by a Minister not under any enactment or law, but under royal prerogative. Passports are one such document; they are not issued by any enactment of this place. That explains why we need both elements of this measure. </p>
<p>I entirely understand why Members desire to know more precisely how the designation powers in clause 4 could be used, but the amendments would create an unwelcome limitation on how those powers might be used in future. I repeat that the Government&#039;s intention under clause 4 is to designate British passports issued to UK residents aged 16 or over, so that an ID card would be issued alongside the passport as a package with the implementation of the second generation of biometric passports. It is no secret that we intend to designate residents permits issued to foreign nationals resident in the UK for more than 3 months, so that the residents permit will also become valid as an ID card. We also intend to issue stand-&nbsp; alone ID cards, but that will be done under clause 8 rather than by using the designation power. However, as we have always made clear, this is enabling legislation designed to allow for the possibility of designating other official documents in future, either as documents alongside which an ID card would be issued or as documents which could be treated as an ID card. </p>
<p>Taking out the reference to documents issued &#039;&#039;under an enactment&#039;&#039; would mean that it would not be possible to designate documents not issued by a Minister of the Crown. We have no plans to do that at this stage, but we should leave open the possibility of doing so in future, should it be required to link the registration and issuing of a card to the application for an official document under an Act of Parliament by a public authority other than a Government Department. Let me give an example to illustrate that. The Home Office is responsible for legislation on firearms&mdash;everyone accepts that&mdash;but not for the issue of licences, which is the responsibility of the police. Thus, if we were to decide to designate a firearms or shotgun certificate, which might well be appropriate, so that anyone applying for such a document would have to register and obtain an ID card if they had not already done so, we would need to use the powers outlined in subsection (2)(a). We must take into account all the kinds of document that we might at least consider it appropriate to designate. I think that people would agree that taking the firearms certificate route might well be a way to capture people who are not necessarily captured by the driving licence or passport routes; that might be worth exploring. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that every attempt to designate a document for these purposes comes back via an order, so this is not the be all and end all. I take the points made by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough about Christmas trees, 60 regulations and all those elements; those points are perfectly fair, but this is where we are with the Bill. We will return to such issues. </p>
<p>Each designation order under the clause will need to be approved by both Houses of Parliament under the affirmative procedure, so we are not talking about something that will be done without opportunity for proper debate and scrutiny. In sum, the amendments would remove the possibility of designating any document not issued by a Department, even if there were a strong case for doing so and if it was a document, such as the firearms certificate, which was the responsibility of the Home Office but not issued by that Department. </p>

[Interruption.] Via which Department, I meant. I shall ignore sedentary comments in future, in line with your earlier exhortation, Mr. Hood. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2004 Act has a specific set of purposes and powers for particular circumstances. Some way down the line, when the system is in place, there may well be some link-over between this Bill and the 2004 Act in the case of an emergency involving authorities, whether local, regional or national, for the statutory purposes of the Bill. But in normal circumstances&mdash;for which the Civil Contingencies Act is clearly not designed&mdash;the overlap between the two is minimal.. </p>

<p> I was being inattentive; I hope that the Minister will forgive me.</p>
<p>I am very interested in this point. What I say is not intended to be antagonistic in any way; I merely want to assist. I had the privilege of sitting on the Committee that considered the Civil Contingencies Bill, and there were many vague points in it. I think that the Minister sees what I am driving at. It would be enormously helpful if he could provide some guidance on what would happen if a state of emergency was declared under the 2004 Act; perhaps he could do so later, in writing. I appreciate that there is no precedent for such a situation, but any guidance would be of enormous assistance to me. </p>

<p> If there is anything further to say in writing, then of course I shall write, but the starting position is simply this: in some years, well down the line, in a civil emergency of any description&mdash;local, regional or national&mdash;and within the context of the statutory purposes of the Bill and the equivalent elements in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, there may well be some interplay between the two. Now, in the context of two separate and distinct pieces of legislation, I do not think that there is quite the interplay that the hon. Gentleman suggests. But if the situation is otherwise, I will certainly come back on the subject in writing.</p>

<p> I, too, served on the Committee considering the Civil Contingencies Bill, but privilege is not quite the word that I would use to describe the experience. My recollection is that, in the four schedules to that Act, there is fairly significant provision for information sharing among certain Government agencies. I do not expect the Minister to answer my point now, but perhaps he could consider it and write to Members of the Committee. To what extent is there potential, because of those information-sharing provisions, for a widening of scope in terms of access to the information held on the database?</p>

<p> I shall say again what I said to the hon. Member for Newark: if it is within the context of the statutory purposes of this Bill, which I hope will eventually be an Act, there may well be uses to which this Bill could be put from a civil contingencies perspective. But that will not allow people to browse or fish or so on. All the other arguments that we have already rehearsed would apply, too. Everyone can see how there could be some utilisation of the register and the data therein in the context of a national, regional &nbsp; or local emergency. If there is more to say on the matter, and on the points that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland made about data sharing, I will happily write to the Committee.</p>
<p>I was deeply worried by a comment made earlier by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland. He seemed to take great enjoyment from the debate we had about rebuttable versus conclusive presumption, which I am sure did not last too long but felt like it did. If he enjoyed it as much as he implied, I would urge him to get out more. </p>
<p>I take the points made by a range of hon. Gentlemen. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud that this matter is not about adding to schedule 1 and its breadth and width. We can return to some of the points that he made when we consider clause 5(3), which is about the documentation needed when registering in the first instance. </p>
<p>While I understand what the amendments seek to do, they are far too narrow and far too restrictive on what is enabling legislation. For the interplay and differences that I have suggested between documents under enactment, documents by royal prerogative and documents that another produces in relation to the police and firearms, rather than ultimate responsibility being with the Home Office, we would prefer the degree of flexibility implied by clause 4 as it stands. I ask the hon. and learned Member for Harborough to withdraw the amendment. </p>

<p> I have a great deal of sympathy with the comments made by the hon. Member for Stroud. We need to know more about what is intended by schedule 1 and by the sorts of documents that are to be designated, either under the royal prerogative or under some enactment by virtue of clause 4. My concern is that we are legislating in ignorance. Having heard the Minister, what concerns me even more is that he is bringing forward a Bill without any real idea about the sorts of documents that he will ask us in due course, under the statutory instrument and the order-making powers, to designate.</p>
<p>I will not divide the Committee, but in exchange for not doing so, I urge the Minister to provide us with a public list of the sort of documents involved between now and consideration on Report, although I do not expect him to say social security document A, B, C and D, fishing licence, driving licence and so on. That would give us a general idea of what he thinks he is doing. Knowing the Minister as I do, I suspect that he is not entirely happy with the way in which the clause is crafted. I think he would like to help us a lot more than he is able to do at the moment. The summer recess will intervene. I suspect that by October he will find it within his powers and grace to return to us on Report with a slightly fuller picture of what the Government hope to do under clause 4. I know that he wants to help the House to do its best with this legislation. I will leave things there, in the strong and happy knowledge that come October he will have a little list. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We move on to the more practical applications of the database. We get into the meat of things and how identity cards will impact on the daily lives of our constituents. If the amendment were accepted, subsection (2) would read &#039;&#039;Where an application to be issued with a designated document is made by an individual, the application may, if the applicant so chooses do one of the following&#039;&#039;. At present, the way in which the Government have matters drafted means that when a person applies for a designed document&mdash;the passport, as the Minister has helpfully told us&mdash;he receives the identity card and his details become part of the identity card register as a result of that application. </p>
<p>The obvious effect of my amendment would be to end the element of compulsion. The hon. Gentleman and others have rightly made great play of the fact that the scheme is not yet compulsory. I suggest that the inclusion of &#039;&#039;must&#039;&#039; goes a long way towards the introduction of compulsion by stealth. We now live in an age when many more people have passports than would have been the case previously. Indeed, passports are used for a wide range of purposes other than foreign travel. By necessity, people will become holders of identity cards. They will become part of the identity register. </p>
<p>The Government extol the virtues of choice in the provision of health and education. It is a new orthodoxy that is sometimes difficult to challenge these days. If the identity card scheme is as good as the Minister claims, and if it has all the manifold benefits that he has spoken about, people will wish to have identity cards and compulsion will not be necessary. It is as simple as that. </p>

<p> I support the hon. Gentleman&#039;s amendment because it has far greater implications than we might realise. Subsection (2) does not deal with an application to be registered, but an application to apply for a designated document. We have just discovered that we do not know what the designated documents are; they could well be any document that the Secretary of State lights upon during the next two or three years. That is why it is all the more important that, by October, we have been given a list by the Minister. We are discussing an application to be issued with a designated document.</p>
<p>I hope that I am not exaggerating matters, but my fear is that, under the system that we are allowing blindly to grip us, next time the hon. Gentleman applies at Lerwick post office for a television licence, a fishing licence, a game licence or any other licence, if that is a designated document he will have to &nbsp; undertake all that is required under subsection (2). Can the Committee imagine the increase in bureaucracy that will flow from the provision to go through the simple process of obtaining, let us say, a television licence? I am not sure that the Government intend such a process, but if it is what they intend, perhaps they would be good enough to tell us. The hon. Gentleman has opened up a little oyster and I hope that the Minister can explain what precisely we ought to be seeing or, more to the point, what the Government intend by the provision. </p>

<p> I am not making light of the amendment. It has opened up a fair debate, but at every stage of proceedings in Committee entirely erroneous amendments are tabled that suggest &#039;&#039;must&#039;&#039; should be inserted for &#039;&#039;may&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;may&#039;&#039; should be inserted for &#039;&#039;shall&#039;&#039;, and so on. If I were being uncharitable&mdash;which I never am&mdash;I would suggest that amendment No. 144 was a wrecking amendment. However, it is in order and on the amendment paper. It is not a wrecking amendment, but that would be the import of its acceptance. We made it clear, in the first instance, that we will introduce and implement identity cards along with a range of documents duly designated, which is what clause 4 is all about.</p>
<p>The hon. and learned Member for Harborough was right that this element of clause 5 is not about either the application to go on the register or the application for an ID card; it is about the application for a designated document. First and foremost, we need to ask ourselves why we have designated documents. We have done that to assist in the roll-out&mdash;if I can abuse the Committee by using that term&mdash;and implementation of the scheme. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that we make provision in clause 5 to say, &#039;&#039;On application from such a date for such a designated document, you will have to get an ID card as well.&#039;&#039; That is the premise on which the implementation is based&mdash;it is partial implementation, rather than full and compulsory implementation from day one. That is one of the key building blocks with which we seek to implement the scheme. Therefore, subsection (2) should contain no wild or stunning revelations. </p>

<p> I do not suppose that there are any stunning or wild revelations. I want to know why the Government are being so reticent about telling us what the designated documents are. With regard to the general argument about access and function creep, why do they not come clean at the beginning of our deliberations on the Bill and say, &#039;&#039;Right, the ID card system and register need to compulsory. Let&#039;s get on with it?&#039;&#039; They should just tell us that this is compulsory, rather than do that by a side wind and say, &#039;&#039;It is not really compulsory, but when you go to get your fishing licence, or whatever, you will have to do what is said in clause 4.&#039;&#039;</p>

<p> That is entirely wrong. While I ruminate over the summer&mdash;happily, for at least three weeks in France, although, unhappily, probably next to an empty swimming pool, given the droughts&mdash;about whether to produce this list, I can say with a &nbsp; high degree of certainty that fishing licences will not be on it.</p>

<p> Yes, make a note of that.</p>
<p>I can say that the biometric passports of 2008 will certainly be included, and that Criminal Records Bureau letters might be&mdash;there are discussions to be had on that&mdash;and that a variety of other documents will also be considered. I will seriously consider this matter, and I may well return to the Committee with a little list&mdash;as it has been described. </p>
<p>Let us nail the other canard. It comes in one of two forms. The one that is easier to dispose of is that it will be compulsory to carry an ID card. We have been there; nothing in any part of the Bill suggests that, but it is still hawked around by those who wish to detract from the Bill. That is fine; they have the right to do that. The other form that it comes in is that somehow the Government have tried to bring in compulsion on the register by the back door. As the Bill clearly illustrates, that will be introduced by the front door; we have made no attempt to disguise that compulsion, in terms of registering on the national register, is the end game for the Bill. That must be the case. We have also said that partial and steady implementation building up to compulsion&mdash;to be on the register, not to carry the card&mdash;is the most appropriate route to take, especially given everything that people have said about the great size and complexity of the scheme. We have clearly stated that we should build up to that by utilising designated documents. That is all that clause 5(2) provides for. </p>
<p>The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland is right that the distinction between &#039;&#039;must&#039;&#039; versus &#039;&#039;may&#039;&#039; is important in this instance&mdash;although, sometimes, and invariably when the argument about it is introduced by the Liberal Democrats, it is not important. Designating the document means that, for that document, from a subsequent date the individual concerned will get a package of that designated document and the ID card. That makes sense to me. </p>
<p>We have said&mdash;the Financial Times carried the story a couple of weeks ago as if it were a shock, horror revelation&mdash;that from next year, with phase one of the introduction of biometric passports, some 4 million people will have to be interviewed and have their biometrics taken by the UK Passport Service. Everybody knew that about a year earlier, but somehow that was news to the Financial Times. Given that the processes and a lot of the data involved are exactly the same for passports and for ID card registration, it makes perfect sense for that to be the first designated document, and part of the partial implementation of the scheme. However, it does not make a great deal of sense if it becomes &#039;&#039;may&#039;&#039; rather than &#039;&#039;must&#039;&#039;. The amendment is entirely fair, and I can understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled it, but it causes a very slight hole in the implementation plan outlined in earlier consultation documents about the partial, and eventual universal, roll-out of the scheme. </p>

<p> Could it be that a lack of specificity is needed in clause 4 because, while the biometric &nbsp; passport is useful for the Government&#039;s purposes in that it brings people into the identity card system register, not everybody wants a passport. I think that some 30 per cent. of the UK population&mdash;or perhaps it is 3 million; the figure 3 is involved&mdash;does not currently have a passport. Perhaps the Government will have to fill the gap with the unspecified designated documents.</p>

<p> That is an entirely fair point. It is 20 per cent. of the population who never have had and never will have a passport&mdash;where the &#039;&#039;3&#039;&#039; comes from I do not know, but I am sure that, as the hon. and learned Gentleman suggests, it is in there somewhere. That is why there will have to be further debates about what to do with that 20 per cent. Perhaps we will designate other documents. If we designate driving licences as well, we might bump it up a bit&mdash;a Venn diagram showing those who have both and those who do not will cover about 90 per cent. of the population. We have made no secret of the fact that registration on the database will ultimately be compulsory&mdash;we want universal coverage. That means two things: it might be appropriate to designate other documents, and it might be that the designation of such documents means a faster coverage of the entire population.</p>

<p> Absolutely not. The hon. Gentleman should not imitate the Financial Times. This is not revelatory. It might be&mdash;although I should be astonished if it were the case&mdash;that the hon. Gentleman has only just noticed that; it was discussed in the previous Bill Committee. There is provision throughout the Bill for what might prevail when registration is compulsory. That is not there in idle speculation because the parliamentary counsel ran out of time and decided to add a few more references in case we went down that route. The ultimate goal has never been anything other than that.</p>
<p>However, the hon. and learned Gentleman is right that one document&mdash;whether a passport or anything else&mdash;will not be suitable to cover everybody. That is why the drafting is broad, but with the caveat that any document required to be designated will come back to this House and will be so designated subject to affirmative resolution by both Houses. It is not for us to invent whatever we want&mdash;dog licences, TV licences or anything else that the hon. and learned Gentleman might suggest&mdash;and process it through the Home Office meat grinder. Anything that we say should be designated for the purposes of the Act will come back to this House to be designated. In that context, I would ask the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland to withdraw his amendment. </p>

<p> With your permission, Mr. Hood, might I make a brief second contribution? I am &nbsp; fascinated by what the Minister said and, rather than having my concerns allayed, I am increasingly concerned by the way in which he is responding to the amendment. I know that the Minister is boxed in; he has been presented with a Bill that is not his. He arrived as the new Minister of State at the Home Office and was told, &#039;&#039;Right, your No. 1 duty is to get this Bill through.&#039;&#039; That is fair enough and I do not attach any personal blame to the Minister. However, he is the representative of the Government and it is right that we should express our alarm at how this is coming forward. I am very concerned&mdash;I hope that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland shares my concern&mdash;that the more we probe into this issue with these innocent sounding amendments, the more we discover the total lack of preparedness at the Home Office.</p>
<p>The Home Office says that this Bill has been round the houses once before, that it had pre-legislative scrutiny and that it has been through a Standing Committee. Why, then, have these issues not been dealt with? Why have answers not been provided, given the number of times that this issue must have been thought about? </p>
<p>I do not know what official has responsibility for driving this area of policy in the Department. However, surely he or she must have been appointed by virtue of their expertise in identity card systems and of their experience of being seconded to other countries where identity cards and registers have been prepared. Surely someone heading up this process is advising the Minister that such problems are to be anticipated. </p>
<p>I am concerned that, although the Minister is doing his level best as the political head of this Committee, we are not getting the sorts of answers that we would expect about this Bill and that process. Both should have received further thought. I look forward to hearing whether the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland&#039;s reaction is the same as or similar to mine. </p>

<p> Yes, I share many of the concerns expressed by the hon. and learned Gentleman. Like him, I have found precious little that is reassuring in this debate. As a former civil servant, albeit only briefly, I suspect that there may be an element of naivety in the hon. and learned Gentleman&#039;s view of how people get jobs in the civil service and what expertise they bring. However, I do not know the background of the team that has been advising the Minister, so I shall not pursue that point.</p>
<p>As one who instinctively dislikes this whole project, I hope and pray that driving licences become designated documents. Everything that I have learned about the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency during my working life&mdash;before I entered Parliament and subsequently&mdash;leads me to think that, given its efficiency, if it got its sticky little mitts on this scheme, it would take 48 hours before the whole thing was turned into reverse. That would be the most effective way of undermining the implementation of the ID card scheme that I could possibly hope for. </p>
<p>The Minister said that there were no wild or stunning revelations; he has rarely spoken a truer &nbsp; word, and the lack of such revelations concerns me most. We do not know what documents other than passports will be designated, nor what the implications will be for everyday application. The hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the next time I went to Lerwick post office to get my television licence. As I said at the start, that gets to the heart of how the Bill will impact on the daily lives of our constituents. </p>
<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman picked a very good example. I shall also come on to this point when we discuss the next group of amendments, if we get there. What would be the situation if we made television licences, for example, designated documents? Such documents are widely available at post offices. Will Lerwick post office have all the equipment necessary for the acquisition of biometric information? </p>

<p> I can help the hon. Gentleman on that question. A few days ago, I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to various Departments of State asking about the cost of installing scanners or readers, and what preparatory work had been done. Invariably, the answer was &#039;&#039;None&#039;&#039;. They had absolutely no idea what they would have to pay, nor whether they would have to install the readers in all their various offices. The Treasury has not done that work either.</p>

<p> That lack of preparation strikes at the heart of the matter.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on a good point, if the Committee will excuse the pun. Clearly, the point that he makes is about going into a post office. Unless there will be a piece of equipment that can recognise the person who is applying for the driving licence or whatever, this particular aspect of the Bill will be nonsensical. Is it not staggering that no preparation has gone into that, and that there is no understanding of the costs involved?</p>

<p> It is staggering, and it is all the more staggering when one considers, as others have observed, that we are second time around the course on this matter. If the House of Lords had acquiesced before the general election, the Government had got their way and the Bill were now an Act, we would not be discussing it, but how many unanswered questions would there still be?</p>

<p> I might be able to help the hon. Gentleman. There is a project under way, which the Home Office has called Project Iris. It is trialling iris readers at 10 locations throughout the country. The running costs for the 10 points are £27.8 million, so while it is of course a pilot, that is some allusion to the cost.</p>

<p> I am aware of Project Iris, and of other projects that have been undertaken and other reports that the Home Office has conducted. It all brings us back to the point that the Government are asking us to buy a pig in a poke. That is not a canard. The Minister is clearly practising for his holidays already. A pig in a poke is the one important aspect of the Bill that impacts directly on our constituents, and that is why at this stage we are entitled to more information than the Minister has given us. &nbsp;</p>

<p> I take the latter point about more information at this stage, but I should say, while mixing contributions, that it is a pig in a poke with at least 60 regulatory power-making elements that will return in some form or other for due parliamentary scrutiny. The hon. Gentleman said that, had the Lords acquiesced and had we had time before the general election, the Bill would be off and away; however, that is not entirely accurate. Those order-making powers are important, and they are a key element of the process.</p>

<p> With respect to the Minister, my point was entirely accurate, though we would now be seeing something of the size and nature of the pig that was emerging from the poke. That has worked that metaphor as far as we can reasonably expect it to go.</p>
<p>Given that we are discussing the Bill second time around; given that we are still not getting any of the detail; given that the provision involves the practical application of the Bill, as it will impact on the lives of our constituents; and given that we have still had no proper answers, I seek to insist on this amendment, and to test the Committee&#039;s opinion of it. </p>

<p> Amendments Nos. 133 and 134 should be read together, as should amendments Nos. 165 and 166 and Nos. 174 and 175, as the same principle is read across different parts of the Bill. For the convenience of the Committee, I shall refer &nbsp; principally to amendments Nos. 133 and 134, and I ask hon. Members to accept that the same effect would be read across from the rest of the group. Amendment No. 46 stands in the names of Conservative Members, and I shall leave them to deal with it.</p>
<p>The purpose of the amendment is to explore in some detail the use, as intended by the Government, of the biometric data that will be gathered for the purposes of the Bill. From a practical point of view, that use is quite important because both the way in which data are used and the complexity of that use will have significant cost implications. As we all know, the cost of implementing the scheme causes significant concern to an increasing number of people. </p>
<p>Amendment No. 133 would delete paragraph (b) of subsection (5), while amendment No. 134 would leave the reference to fingerprints in that paragraph but remove the reference to biometric information. The two amendments are obviously not compatible, but as they are probing in nature, they can be considered together. </p>
<p>The expression </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;other biometric information about himself&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>causes me some concern. We know from the schedules that that will include iris and face recognition biometric information. The Minister has continued to defend the argument that schedule 1 should be amendable by statutory instrument only, so we also know that it would be possible to add other biometric information, presumably including such things as DNA. It would be fairly straightforward for him to add such definitions, as it would merely involve introducing a statutory instrument. I find that quite concerning. </p>
<p>There are substantial considerations about practical application. How many places will be made available for the recording of such information? I declare my constituency interest in that regard. How will the process be made to work for people in the remoter parts of the country, by which I mean those that are remote from London? Does the Minister intend that we should have an office in Orkney and one in Shetland? I should hope so. Otherwise a significant cost for my constituents will be attached to obtaining a designated document. There was talk at one point of a mobile unit travelling to parts of the country that are more difficult to reach. I think that that would also be unacceptable. One does not always know when one may want to obtain a designated document such as a passport, if that is what we are considering. If it so happens that one of my constituents in Shetland needs a passport at short notice when the mobile unit happens to be in the Western Isles, it will be of no use to them. </p>
<p>What criteria will the Government use in establishing the areas that will be served in that way? Will there be a general rule? I think I heard a suggestion about those living within 45 minutes&#039; journey of a centre. On a good day, with a following wind, 45 minutes might take some of my constituents to Bergen. Will we have facilities in the consulate &nbsp; there? This issue seems to strike at the heart of the Bill. There are cost implications, and I have a particular concern, as a constituency MP, that when the question of cutting costs arises, provision will diminish in areas such as the one that I represent, simply for the convenience of the Government, who will want to maintain costs for the scheme at a lower level. </p>
<p>I am raising an important practical question to which there has so far been no answer. There may be other points to be raised, but I want to keep the debate tightly focused at this stage. </p>

<p> Much of what the hon. Gentleman has just said makes a huge amount of sense to Conservative Members. In particular, those of us with rural constituencies where people are more widely spread out may feel the need to question the Government, especially about mobile units and the specified time and place at which people would attend, as well as about the practical provisions in clause 5, such as when and where to be photographed and have fingerprints taken or</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;otherwise to provide such information as may be required by the Secretary of State.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>My principal aim, however, is to speak to amendment No. 46, which falls sensibly and conveniently under clause 9, which is entitled: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;Renewal of ID cards for those compulsorily registered&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>The amendment would ensure that clause 9(4)(b) required the relevant person to allow &#039;&#039;all of&#039;&#039; </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;his fingerprints, and other biometric information about himself, to be taken and recorded&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>I want to talk first about fingerprinting and secondly about biometric information. </p>
<p>There has been criticism on all sides, but particularly from the Government, of the London School of Economics document, &#039;&#039;The Identity Project&#039;&#039;. I do not want to quote matters of principle involved, however; they may come up later. I will focus on the specific examples that the document discusses concerning fingerprints and their reliability in the context initially of the register, and later of the card. Some good points are made. For instance, the document states: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;The GAO report concluded that the fingerprints of about 2 to 5 percent of people cannot be captured &#039;because the fingerprints are dirty or have become dry or worn from age, extensive manual labour, or exposure to corrosive chemicals&#039;.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>Later on, there were suggestions that refuseniks as far as the register and the card are concerned could willingly damage their fingerprints by taking up a pumice stone and setting to work. That is not an agreeable prospect, as I am sure hon. Members would agree, but it can be done. Anybody who has sanded a piece of oak or hardwood knows that at the end their hands feel agreeably smooth. They will run them over the hands of their spouse and he or she will say, &#039;&#039;What smooth hands you&#039;ve got&#039;&#039;. I will go no further, Mr. Hood, but that is what I am told by colleagues. </p>
<p>The point is that it might seem that a fingerprint is not only unique, which clearly it is, but indestructible, which it is not. It can be worn off. In the same way in which one can file a nail, one can pumice away one&#039;s fingerprints. On top of that, if people are skilled &nbsp; enough, they can fit false fingerprints. I gather that that has been pioneered&mdash;if that is putting my finger on the right phrase&mdash;in Russia and Ukraine by some of the serious and organised crime agencies there. </p>
<p>Much more worryingly, the report that I mentioned went on to say: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;People who had recently used hand cream created serious problems for the fingerprint readers&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>A number of the people currently in this Room will have used hand cream this morning. Perhaps they have popped out for a quick comfort break to stick on a bit of hand cream&mdash;I do not know. I do not wish to be silly about this issue, but it is possible that innocent activities will create great difficulties for fingerprinting. Similarly, there could be a problem involving those with </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;particularly hard or calloused skin, such as chefs, gardeners and labourers.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>It is interesting that the error rates in fingerprinting are both significant and poorly understood. The report said that, according to the fingerprint verification competition 2004&mdash;a recent review of available systems&mdash; </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;only a handful of products achieved an equal error rate of under 3 per cent., and most were much worse. Furthermore, it would be hazardous and risky for governments to lock their core infrastructure into a single proprietary product while both attack and defence are evolving rapidly.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>I will move on from there and illustrate the point. Following the Madrid bombings on 11 March 2004, the Spanish national police managed to lift a fingerprint from an unexploded bomb. Three highly skilled FBI fingerprint experts declared that Oregon lawyer Brandon Mayfield&#039;s prints were a match to the crime scene sample. American officials described the match as &#039;&#039;absolutely incontrovertible&#039;&#039; and as a &#039;&#039;bingo match&#039;&#039;. As a former US soldier, Mayfield&#039;s fingerprints were on the national fingerprint system. He was imprisoned for two weeks. However, the fingerprint was not his. According to one law professor: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;The Mayfield misidentification also reveals the danger that extraneous knowledge might influence experts&#039; evaluations. If any of those FBI fingerprint examiners who confidently declared the match already knew that Mayfield was himself a convert to Islam who had once represented a convicted Taliban sympathizer in a child custody dispute, this knowledge may have subconsciously primed them to &#039;&#039;see&#039;&#039; the match.&#039;&#039;</p>

<p> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that a fingerprint check would normally be made to verify whether he or someone else is who they claim to be? Although, as we know, it is always possible that a fingerprint will match someone somewhere else in the world, the probability that it will be the particular person whom someone is attempting to impersonate is negligible.</p>

<p> That is exactly the point that I have talked about with the Mayfield example. People may &#039;&#039;see the match&#039;&#039;. The situation that the hon. Gentleman refers to is extremely unlikely. The point of the amendment is that if indeed we are to use fingerprints, we should use all of them, rather than one. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman, who is another Nottinghamshire Member, I might add. I am not an expert and I would have to be &nbsp; convinced, but I think that that would clear up any possibility of misidentification.</p>
<p>I talk about fingerprints at some length simply because I want to ask the Minister whether he is content that this is a properly tested system. I repeat that both the defence and the attack on fingerprints as a means of identification are still developing. The more that we intend to use fingerprints as a means of identification, an anti-crime measure or whatever, the more criminals and ne&#039;er-do-wells will try to improve their ability to erase or counterfeit them. So the first question for the Minister is whether he is content that we know enough about fingerprint technology, and the technology of faking or eradicating, to use it at the moment. </p>
<p>Secondly, if the Minister is content that we do know enough, or if he says, &#039;&#039;Who knows, but it is the best thing that we have at the moment in conjunction with other biometric knowledge&#039;&#039;, then I would probably accept that. However, in that case, would it not be sensible to amend the Bill so that all fingerprints&mdash;all 10 dabs&mdash;are used, rather than the customary one on the left hand and one on the right hand? As someone who has had his fingerprints taken many times, I think that that is clearly something on which we need to concentrate, because the old system, under which one print was taken on each hand, has changed dramatically. Attack and defence is evolving, and I hope that he will make it very clear how that piece of biometric information would function. </p>

<p> I want briefly to follow on from where the hon. Gentleman left off, and to take up the other part of the issue: the</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;other biometric information about himself, to be taken and recorded&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>mentioned in clause 5(5)(b). Why can we not specify what the other biometric information is? Quite simply, this is enabling legislation, and we either know what that other biometric information is, and so should be able to specify it, or do not know, and so should not have reference to it in the Bill. </p>
<p>The issue is partly about cost, but it is also about the logistics of how we use the new technology. To my mind, we are talking about fingerprints and facial and iris recognition. If we are serious about the Bill and how we are to cost the implications of ID cards, we should either spell that out in the Bill or accept that we cannot legislate on it as yet and not spell it out. I look to my hon. Friend the Minister to give me clarification on whether that information can be captured at this time, made meaningful in the legislation and made distinct. </p>

<p> I agree with the hon. Gentleman, who makes a telling point, just as I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Newark. I remind the Committee that Leicester, which is the nearest big city to my constituency of Harborough, was one of the five cities that trialled the Home Office testing that was carried out in relation to the ID scheme. I am afraid that the results of the fingerprint tests in that city were not very happy for the Government. Of the 772 people who submitted their fingerprints in Leicester, 642, or 83.16 per cent., were identified correctly, and that is &nbsp; the lowest rate of any test centre in the United Kingdom. That is a failure rate of almost 17 per cent. in matching the individual to the fingerprint. The test centre also threw up problems with eye identification, with the second poorest verification rates of the five centres throughout the country.</p>
<p>Leicester has an ethnic minority population, predominantly of Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani extraction, of about 30 to 35 per cent. One of the points that was made forcefully, not least by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), was that the system would create problems for ethnic minorities, not only because of the process, but because of the recognition failures that will follow. We can understand that in respect of those who are less experienced in fingerprints. Other biometric information shows that those who have a cataract operation cannot properly use the iris scan system. Those who have an eye disease cannot necessarily use it. The biometric system will throw up plenty of built-in faults. </p>
<p>I return to schedule 1 and a point about which the hon. Member for Stroud reminds us from time to time. The photograph will simply be of the head and shoulders. I referred to that at our previous sitting. For facial recognition, the Government must be fairly clear that they want a picture of someone&#039;s face, not the back of his head. </p>

<p> Like the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, I have certain worries about people and access when being called to give their fingerprints or to attend a retina test. During our proceedings on the previous Bill, we had some help from the Minister. He allayed some of my fears when he said that he was discussing with the Royal National Institute of the Blind and disability rights groups the accessibility of such facilities to people with disabilities. We must think of the aged and consider how they will deal with such requirements. Can the Minister again allay my fears about such matters?</p>

<p> The impact of subsection (5)(b) will be huge. It is requesting a database of more than 60 million entries. That is large, and, at our previous sitting, I asked the Minister about the size of the individual file that would be held on it. I look forward to his providing that information. I hope that he will use the opportunity today to let us know exactly how much information will be placed on the database, from fingerprints and other biometric information, that will have an impact on the file size and say how large a database we shall have.</p>
<p>Let us consider some of the other databases for which the Government have been responsible. The latest, the NHS database, as well as the air traffic control system database have suffered because of their size and the difficulties in providing information to the people who are supposed to being using it. The more information that we place on the identification card or on the register, the more people we will require to &nbsp; gather the information. Will the Minister explain the size of the staff that would be required nationally to make the system work? </p>
<p>There are also cost implications. I challenge the Minister to come up with an upper figure and say how much is the maximum projected cost that the Government would be willing to spend on the project? I ask because the original cost of the NHS database was £6.2 billion, and it has spiralled to £20.3 billion. The probation service database started at £85 billion, then increased to £120 billion before it was scrapped. The air traffic control system database increased from £35 billion to £630 billion. Those are huge jumps from starting costs to the final package. </p>
<p>When we debated such matters for the first time in the Chamber, we learned that there are several gaps in the information provided by the Government about how matters will work in practice. Without all the information, it is difficult for us to place a figure on matters. The sum of £5 billion has been suggested, but all sorts of figures have been mentioned. I would be grateful if the Minister could say whether there is a maximum figure. </p>
<p>We are clearly not the first country to go down the road of considering ID cards and biometric data. Will the Minister let us know what research there has been and what lessons he has learned from considering other systems? I understand, for example, that China has thrown out the use of some of the biometric information-gathering processes because of cost and accuracy. It would be useful to know whether a yardstick, precedent or system already exists that we can point to and say, &#039;&#039;Yes, this is what we would like and what we would like to work in the United Kingdom.&#039;&#039; </p>

<p> I rise not to question the idea that biometrics should be part of the ID card system, because I am aware of the Government&#039;s commitment to the European passport and the agreement to include biometrics. I was reassured by the Minister&#039;s comments&mdash;in the previous sitting, I think&mdash;that DNA could not be included unless that was specifically part of the Bill. He said that there would have to be separate legislation. He will probably repeat that point later.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should declare an interest. Until recently, I was part of the Government&#039;s Qinetiq and was involved in the e-borders initiative and in some of the evidence on biometrics given to the Select Committee before the election. Knowing the Minister&#039;s dislike of the LSE report, perhaps it is best if I take my references from the report of the Home Affairs Committee. </p>
<p>The real question reflects the views of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland about rural issues and about people travelling from far away. Before I came to the House, I represented part of north-east Scotland in the Scottish Parliament. There were very large rural areas to cover. When people go to register or to become involved in the system, there may be an awful lot of mileage to cover. </p>
<p>I question the maturity of the biometrics being proposed and, therefore, the viability of the Bill, for &nbsp; now. I understand, in part, why the Government do not want to tie down specific biometrics in a prescriptive form, because the reading of biometrics is not particularly mature. It is changing all the time. We may find in a year&#039;s time that another type of biometric can come to the fore. The Government do not want to be hemmed in, but that in itself raises the question why there is so much urgency to have the Bill now. </p>
<p>Iris recognition is currently a very expensive method of determining identification. Although I know that Project Iris has a lot more to it than just 10 units around the country, it is still a £28 million project and even if a fraction of that was the cost of a reader, that could be £28,000. That is a lot of money per reader. That is not because the Minister has gone out and bought the most expensive readers; it is because the technology is not mature. </p>
<p>In the past, I often took initial technologies and tried to make them mature for the marketplace. It is an expensive and volatile process. My hon. Friend the Member for Newark pointed out the problems with fingerprints and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough pointed out the problems with iris recognition. I question whether we are doing this too early. I know that the Minister will say that this is enabling legislation and that we can keep it in our back pocket and then start using it. However, the nature of these things is that it will not happen that way. We will start by going down the path of one of biometric; we are already committed to a number of them for passports. </p>
<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) has pointed out, the cost implications every time we change a system in any Government project&mdash;every time we decide, for example, that we are not going to have a signature, but are going to have a fingerprint&mdash;are such that costs are massively magnified. The changing of the spec is a problem. I have only to quote from the report, which stated that the delay in the pilot run by the UK Passport Service was because it was subject to </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;a series of hardware, software and ergonomic problems&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>Imagine the ergonomic problems if one had to go to a post office in Lerwick or somewhere else to take part in that process. </p>
<p>I am not saying the biometrics should be cut, because we shall need them if we are to have ID cards. However, I am not sure that we are at the right stage to have them, because they have not been tried and tested and the cost has not been properly assessed. I hope that the Minister can reassure us about the DNA, as he has done before. </p>

<p> Amendments Nos. 133 and 165 seek to remove the power to require individuals to provide biometric information. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland raised some valid points about access for his constituents, which I shall deal with in a moment. I shall start with the principle, and why we believe it right to link the scheme to the capture of biometric information. Amendments Nos. 134 and 166 would limit the power so that only fingerprint biometrics are required. Amendments Nos. 174 and &nbsp; 175 would prevent biometric information from being verified using the register, even when it is done with the consent of the individual&mdash;for example, when opening a bank account.</p>
<p>The amendments go to the heart of our scheme. As the Committee knows, the scheme is based on the premise of using a biometric identifier. The reason for going down that path&mdash;this links to points raised by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre&mdash;is that it will prevent the use of multiple identities. One of the core values of the biometric system is that it will prevent the same person from registering and acquiring multiple documents in different names. The use of a biometric will prevent that; it means that one person will be able to register for one passport or other document. </p>

<p> The Minister makes a valid point. If things were as simple as that, it would make sense. Unfortunately, the biometrics are not up to such a technical strength as to guarantee that the details on the card are those of the person whose biometrics have been captured. We sense that when the card is used, the information may have changed or that there might be a discrepancy between the person being checked and the information originally captured some months or even years ago. If the system was foolproof, it would be a different ballgame, but it is not and we cannot rely on it.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman has to understand that we propose a highly secure enrolment process to ensure that people applying for documents such as passports or identity cards are who they say they are and that they are the holder of a unique biometric. People talk about the complications that will be caused by the Bill, but the material difference, bearing in mind that large databases already exist, is that the Bill links the personal data held on the system and the biometric. We believe that the creation of that linkage between the data&mdash;facts and figures such as an address and a date of birth&mdash;and the personal biometric will provide the high standard of identity verification that will bring many benefits.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre said that the technology is in its infancy, but I refute that. The FBI automatic fingerprint identification system has some 47 million fingerprint records. Hon. Members will know that, as a matter of course, the US immigration authorities take biometric fingerprint scans of people entering the country. That is a huge database. The US Department of Defence has a biometric database of about 22 million records. Those systems are already in use, and we think it right and prudent to take advantage of them. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland questioned the phrase &#039;&#039;other biometric information&#039;&#039;, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud. A clear explanation of the terminology used in the Bill can be found in clause 43. Biometric information is defined as </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;data about . . . external characteristics, including, in particular, the features of an iris or any other part of the eye&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>Our intention is to have flexibility, so that a range of external biometrics can be used. &nbsp;</p>
