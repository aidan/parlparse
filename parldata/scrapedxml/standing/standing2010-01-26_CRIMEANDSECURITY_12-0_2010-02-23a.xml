<p> I was responding to the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham who was, unusually, promoting the notion of a ban-albeit a delayed one-that would be introduced, ironically, through a statutory instrument. Therefore, I assume that this is a rather academic discussion.</p>

<p> Amendable, but a statutory instrument nevertheless. That will not be necessary because the short history of the issue shows that the Government have moved from the licensing of individuals involved in wheel-clamping to the current proposals on the licensing of companies. We have demonstrated our intent, and we would not have got to this stage-a major part of a major Bill-were we not determined to take the correct action that will have the desired effect. I do not accept that we should have a ban, albeit one that hangs like the sword of Damocles.</p>
<p>I shall respond quickly to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, who suggested that we could avoid the problems if the owners of private land simply fenced it off. We had a short discussion about whether that was mainly a rural issue. It is an urban issue, too, because there are many areas, including old people's homes, hospitals and a variety of private land, that require some form of parking control. There is a host of areas for which it would be impractical to insist that if owners did not want people to park there, they should fence them off. That is why we are making our current suggestions.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Romford highlighted the need for the action we are taking, because he gave a number of examples of the type of unacceptable behaviour that we are trying to get rid of. These include release fees, signage and so on, which will be an important part of the code of practice.</p>
<p>I want to concentrate slightly longer on the comments made by the hon. Member for Winchester, who set out a range of objections to the route we are taking. I shall try to persuade his colleagues and others that ours is the right route. He advocated that local authorities should take control of the situation. Like the hon. Member for Romford, I cannot recall from the evidence session that the representative of local authorities showed a great deal of enthusiasm for the idea of them taking this on. We kept coming back to the perennial cost question and an acknowledgment that, were we to go down that route with an entirely different model, there would be a cost involved. I am not sure that the local taxpayer should pick up the cost. The way in which we are proceeding represents a fairer and more proportionate system.</p>

<p> I wonder whether the Minister can recall any enthusiasm from the witnesses for the Government's solution.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.2.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" speakername="Alan Campbell" time="16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s01.htm#100223109000059" colnum="415">
<p> The hon. Gentleman says that but, in fact, we have been consulting on a range of proposals for some time. I accept that nobody came out in complete support of everything that we were doing. However, by and large, we have managed to satisfy a majority on most of the issues raised in those sessions and during the consultation process, such as what a code of practice would look like, or crucially whether there should be an independent appeals mechanism. I admit that at one point it was not clear that that was what we were proposing-but we are. People often have their own views and put forward alternatives. However, in the absence of a clearly more acceptable alternative, I think that we have broad support for our suggestions.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Winchester mentioned incentivisation, which we have discussed before, with regard to whether there will be a great incentive to carry out wheel-clamping to maximise profits. Incentivisation might have an attraction now, because there is a fairly open-ended and loose system through which people can make extortionate profits, but part of what we are doing is to put limits on things such as release fees and to address issues regarding what happens if vehicles are impounded overnight and whether people have to pay for that. Many incentives that might have been in place will not exist under the scheme that we are advocating. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the need for an appeals procedure. As we will discuss later, there will be not only such a procedure, but an independent one.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman also spoke about some entirely unacceptable examples of people who were forced to abandon their cars during the bad weather coming back to find that they were wheel-clamped. I cannot give a complete undertaking that that will not be possible in the future, but if we address issues such as signage and release fees, many of those problems could be resolved. If Members of Parliament and others are thinking about going to the companies and saying, "Surely this is unfair," please remember that companies will need to have an appeals procedure and, under the code of practice, they will also need to have a complaints procedure. Beyond that, there will also be an independent complaints procedure, through which I am sure some such complaints could be not only heard, but upheld.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.2.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" speakername="Douglas Hogg" time="16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s01.htm#100223109000062" colnum="415">
<p> With regard to the appeals procedure and its independence, who will determine the criteria that the independent appellate body will have to apply?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.2.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" speakername="Alan Campbell" time="16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s01.htm#100223109000063" colnum="416">
<p> The code of practice will set out clearly what companies will be allowed and not allowed to do. It will deal with issues such as how much had been charged, whether the signage was adequate, whether there was information about whom one could complain to, which company was responsible in the first instance, and how one could get in touch with the appeals procedure. All that will be dealt with in the code of practice. Therefore, in a sense, the independent adjudicators will not only be addressing the code of practice because, as we will get on to later, legal minds will be brought to bear, so I am sure that they will be able to bring some reasonableness and common sense to the issue.</p>

<p> The hon. Member for Winchester also raised the question of self-regulation. We are not going down that route. He talked about some of the problems that have arisen with ticket parking. We are determined not to go down that route because we want to ensure that our proposals have teeth. He also asked, as his defence of using local authorities as the best route on this matter, whether the proposal amounted to a licence to print money. I remind the Committee that we intend to cap fees and, through that, to change business behaviour.</p>
<p>Let me say-I do not think that this has been raised, but it is pertinent to the whole of our deliberations-that while the proposal is about changing the behaviour of the businesses currently involved in vehicle immobilisation, it is also about changing motorists' behaviour. The reality is that quite a number of people who are clamped are clamped for valid reasons-they should not be parking where they have parked. Therefore, we must have a system that is proportionate.</p>
<p>Finally, the hon. Gentleman expressed concern that if it was left to the companies, and not the local authorities, the companies would simply disappear, and rebrand and relaunch themselves. I have two points to make about that: first, they would still need a licence if they attempted to do that; and, secondly, the Security Industry Authority is very experienced in dealing with such practice, because it has been attempted in other areas of its activity. It is very good at holding to account people who try to evade the rules and directors who think they are being clever by setting up a different company. I am confident that we are taking the right route.</p>
<p>By restricting wheel-clamping activities to local authorities, new clause 3 would effectively ban wheel-clamping on private land, because of course local authorities have no power to control parking on private land. We &nbsp;would be taking quite a big step if we went down that route. Some people have advocated that as a way forward, but we believe that a system of licensing businesses will deal with the matter more effectively.</p>
<p>Let me briefly turn to new clause 27(1), which would ban wheel-clamping and related activities, restriction and removal against a release fee. Subsection (2) of the new clause would mean that an occupier of the premises would be committing an offence automatically if anyone else carried out wheel-clamping and related activities on his premises with his permission. It would only require the occupier to have given permission for the activity to take place, or for those activities to be carried out under a contract for the supply of services to him. That would not be the right approach. It is appropriate to allow wheel-clamping on private land in England and Wales to continue. I know that that is not a universal view, but that is our belief, subject to the new controls on the wheel-clamping businesses. We want to strike the right balance between the rights of motorists and the rights of landowners, who are entitled to control or prevent parking on their land. For example, businesses in a town centre or near a railway station will quite reasonably want to keep their parking space free for customers. We do not believe that we should limit their choice of how they do that, provided that they comply with the law. We want to ensure that the sector is regulated properly and that we get rid of exploitation and excess, which is what our measures will do.</p>
<p>New clause 27(3) would restrict the penalties available to a fine without the option of imprisonment. As we discussed that matter earlier today in relation to amendments 90 to 93, I will not go into any more detail.</p>
<p>New clause 30 would create a statutory requirement to make regulations that would provide for a code of practice for the business licensing scheme. The provision is unnecessary because the Private Security Industry Act 2001 already provides for regulations to be made whereby the Secretary of State can specify the conditions to be attached to any licence that the Security Industry Authority issues. We have made it very clear-and I am happy to repeat it again-that we plan to make regulations that will be the basis for a code of practice. We expect that they will cover warning signs, release fees and a range of other matters. We will put it in secondary legislation because, having listened to a fairly lengthy debate both inside and outside the House, we want to decide on the contents, and consult publicly on the details. I hope that I have explained sufficiently why new clauses 3, 27 and 30 are not necessary, and I hope that clause 39 will stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p> Order. In view of what has just been put on the record, and given my 27 years of experience in the House, may I offer the hon. Lady a small word of advice? In future, when choosing a seat, make sure you are in full view of the Chair.</p>

<p> I have already taken that advice on board, Mr. Cook, which is why I have moved from where I was sitting this morning. I will now be able to catch your eye whenever I wish this afternoon.</p>
<p>I have sympathy with some of the new clauses about wheel-clampers. During the evidence sittings, it became apparent to me that we do not really need wheel-clamping firms. Whatever the Minister says about people who park illegally, surely we do not need clamping firms to enforce regulations. We should have a properly regulated ticketing system, which I will talk about later.</p>
<p>I agree that we need good signage, limits on release fees and a code of practice, but, as we heard in the evidence sittings, the fear of the RAC and others is that the firms currently making a lot of money through practices that extort money from people will move to ticketing. I am sorry to say that the types of restrictions that we are introducing for wheel-clamping firms will not read across to ticketing. The same firms often carry out such practices. As we heard, they will put up a closed circuit television camera and small, insignificant notices, and if people overstay an hour's parking, they will end up getting a parking charge disguised as a penalty charge notice.</p>
<p>In my area-part of my constituency is a seaside resort-many visitors, as well as residents, keep getting caught out, because private firms operate alongside local authority car parks. We have to do something to prevent that leaching to ticketing. Those firms make their money through excessive charges. The right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham may correct me, but I believe that there is absolutely nothing in criminal law that says that such firms can issue excessive charges. There is no way that they can take somebody to court or put points on a licence.</p>

<p> I think that is correct. The only way in which that could technically be done would be for the owner to lodge a civil suit for trespass. The unauthorised parking of a vehicle on private property is a trespass for which, in theory at least, one could claim damages, which would represent some form of rental charge. I think that is the only legal process that would ever be available to an occupier of private land in the circumstances under discussion.</p>

<p> I appreciate that clarification. It is, therefore, correct that the firms rely on ignorance of the law by issuing things that look, to all intents and purposes, like a penalty charge notice. They have the same lay-out and use the same typefaces, and they threaten to take one to court, even though they cannot do so. I am worried that the unintended consequence of what we are doing for the wheel-clamping firms-or vehicle immobilisation firms-is that they are simply going to make their money in an unregulated way.</p>
<p>I realise that there are limitations in the Bill, because we are dealing with the security industry. However, I understand that it is the Department for Transport that would have to do something to deal with ticketing if the firms choose to go down that road to make their money. What discussions has my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary had with the Department for Transport about those issues? Is there any chance that we can address those worries on Report?</p>

<p> I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester, who cannot be here to listen to the Minister's detailed and considered response to the points made by my hon. Friend on new clause 3.</p>
<p>I listened carefully, but the bottom line is that the Minister is not in a position to give any assurances. The Minister cannot assure the Committee that someone who is clamped-whether legally parked or otherwise-on a cold and windy night and not sure who owns the land will not be fleeced by a wheel-clamper. New clause 3 makes the matter clear; it is very simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>The Minister may be right that local authorities would not be keen on the responsibility if they were required to pick up the operating cost themselves, but I am sure that there are ways and means of ensuring that that would not be the case, and that those seeking support for wheel-clamping, rather than the council tax payer, would pay the fee. We would support making sure that there was no linkage between the number of clamps applied and the fee that any company, local authority or private contractor employed by a local authority could obtain from the clamping.</p>
<p>Again, the bottom line has to be whether the measure will work to protect drivers in all circumstances. The Minister cannot assure the Committee that what he is proposing, for which there was no great enthusiasm among the witnesses, will do the job. When there is an opportunity to vote against the clause, I shall certainly do so.</p>

<p> May I make this point to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington? The problem about voting against the new clause is that, in theory, we are left with nothing, which is bad news. I would prefer the total ban, but I do not think that I shall be allowed to vote for that and, in any case, I do not suppose I have the big battalions. If we vote against clause stand part, we are left without any form of regulatory regime, which would be bad news. Although, personally, I am uncomfortable with the way forward and would prefer the course of action that I advocated to the Committee, I shall not be supporting the hon. Gentleman and I rather hope that my colleagues will not.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.2.24" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" speakername="Alan Campbell" time="16:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s02.htm#100223109000090" colnum="419">
<p> We have been looking at the issue for some time and I understand that there are different views about the best way forward. Should local authorities be responsible? Should we ban wheel-clamping in the first place? In reality, in many cases, private landowners need some way of regulating parking on their land and, in some cases, of preventing parking on their land. In the Bill, we are cleaning up an industry which, as it currently operates, has many examples of unacceptable practice.</p>
<p>That does not, however, necessarily lead to the conclusion that there is no room for wheel-clamping at all, which to some extent is a matter of choice for landowners. If they go down that route, then by licensing the businesses with a strict code of conduct, we expect the excesses to disappear and the industry to be as responsible as it can be in the circumstances.</p>
<p>On the issue of ticketing, clamping is dealt with because we are doing it through the SIA-clamping is dealt with through the Private Security Industry Act 2001, but ticketing is not. I have had discussions with colleagues from the Department for Transport, in particular when we were looking to secure an independent appeals &nbsp;procedure and looking for models that we could either piggyback or replicate somewhere else, but the issue of ticketing is for them to deal with. In the Bill, we are dealing with wheel-clamping.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington claims that I am not in a position to reassure people that their circumstances will be better on a cold and windy night, when they risk being fleeced. However cold and windy it happens to be, unless there is adequate signage that is informative about what can and cannot take place in that area, the code of practice will be being breached.</p>
<p>If by "being fleeced" the hon. Gentleman means that people will be given excessive charges for release, I should say that that will not be allowed under the code either. If they are not happy and cannot come to some agreement with the company if wheel-clamping is taking place, there will be an independent appeals procedure which will have the final say. Ultimately, if a company acts in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman, it risks losing its licence. If it loses its licence it cannot take part in the industry in future. I am not as pessimistic as the hon. Gentleman about the outcome of the Bill.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister for giving way. How will he ensure that drivers have a clear understanding of what they are supposed to be seeing on the notices on this hypothetical cold, windy and perhaps wet night? He cannot give those assurances. He cannot give an assurance that they will know what is required to be on display and therefore the risk of people being clamped in unacceptable circumstances remains, because they will not be in a position to challenge it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.2.26" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" speakername="Alan Campbell" time="16:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s02.htm#100223109000096" colnum="420">
<p> That is precisely why we are consulting widely and thoroughly on not only the question of signage, but what would be on the signs. I take the point that if it is dark the signage needs to be lit. Many people in all of our constituencies use car parks on cold, windy and wet nights, but that is not an excuse to say, "I'm not going to pay that fine because I could not understand the sign". Those signs will have been worked out; the lighting will be adequate. The machines will be clear, so there will be no prospect of people's not knowing what their responsibility is if they park their vehicles.</p>

<p> The fact is that however a new law on vehicle clamping is implemented, there will be problems to be resolved. There is some consensus between the Government and the Opposition on the fact that if we do nothing, we leave a problem without a solution. Does signage need to be explained to every driver? Everywhere we go on every highway there is signage. Surely it is common sense that, if we park our cars somewhere, just as we do when we park in a public car park, we check the signs to see whether there is a fee to pay and what the rules are. If the Liberal Democrats oppose the measure, a lot of people out there will wonder why. A lot of people are very angry about the current law and they want it to be tightened. The clause may not go as far as we would like, but it is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p> I am grateful for that support. It would not be the first time that the Liberals were on the wrong side of the public, and I suspect it will not be the last. The public are not fools, particularly when there is &nbsp;publicity for such issues, and they know what their responsibilities are. I am sure that where there are anomalies or disagreements, if the two parties cannot agree, there will be an opportunity to resolve those matters once the complaints and independent appeals procedure is in place. There are many views about how the problems can be resolved, but we have produced a set of proposals that commands general support. I hope that the Committee will support them.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment 173, in clause 41, page 83, line 24, after 'telephone', insert</p>
<p class="indent">'or any device capable of sending or receiving electronic data'.</p>
<p>The amendment would tighten up the sensible policy of removing mobile devices from prisoners serving custodial sentences and not allowing them to communicate with the outside world. There is, however, little point in doing that unless we ensure that other devices are also unavailable to the prisoner. In the modern world, all sorts of devices, particularly those that access the internet, allow people to communicate with the outside world, so there is little point in singling out the mobile phone, although we support that prohibition wholeheartedly. With the amendment, we are asking the Government to consider other devices that may be used.</p>
<p>We have seen examples recently of how other devices have been used and we urge the Government to look at that before deciding what to do. Devices nowadays can do a lot more than make or receive calls; many can access the internet. There have been several incidents involving their use, which we need to consider carefully. Murderers have boasted about their life behind bars, which is something that no one in prison should be allowed to do. Imagine the victim or their relatives knowing that the murderer is boasting via the internet. We need to tighten up the law.</p>
<p>The law should stop such people flaunting their crimes and taunting the justice system. Only a couple of weeks ago, the murderer of Ben Kinsella updated his Facebook page, writing that he wanted a remote control to "mute or delete people" when he needed to. That is another example of how an electronic device can be used in prison to intimidate people outside. Less than two weeks ago, an arsonist serving an indefinite life sentence updated his Facebook page to describe a life of playing computer games, getting drunk on home-brew and enjoying sleep-ins-mocking the innocent victims of the crimes for which he was jailed. The Government should tighten up the provisions and extend the principle, so that not just mobile phones but other devices are covered. Recently, Ashley Graham in HMP Lindholme updated his Facebook page with:</p>
<p class="indent">"HMP Holiday's a place where men can come for a nice relaxin break from their moanin women and crying kids. No stress just rest."</p>
<p>Mark Elliot, who as part of a group savagely beat a father of three to death, also had access to Facebook via a phone, and updated comments and posted pictures. The problem is widespread.</p>
<p>People are put in prison to lose their freedom and be punished for the crime they have committed against society. It cannot be right to allow any prisoner easy access to people in the outside world, to communicate with them and perhaps work with them to commit other crimes or intimidate people. Prisoners should not be allowed the same freedoms that law-abiding people enjoy. That is a simple principle. I hope that the Government will take that into account, reconsider, and accept our amendment.</p>

<p> I rise to speak in support of what I think may be a probing amendment to flush out the Government's thinking. If the Government seek to ensure that it is an offence to use telephones in prison because they are used to pursue criminal activities, thereby discouraging that use, they need to bear in mind that there are many other things that prisoners can and do use in prison for that purpose that can be just as harmful, as the hon. Member for Romford set out. A considered response is therefore required.</p>
<p>This may be another opportunity to briefly raise the fact that the most effective way of tackling the problem of telephone calls in prisons is a technical blocking device that can stop calls coming through, which is being investigated. I will listen with interest to why the Minister of State does not feel it necessary to extend the legislation to things such as Facebook, which are clearly used by criminals to pursue their criminal activities.</p>

<p> I rise to support the amendment in its terms, but I am bound to say that I do not entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Romford. I hope he will forgive me if I explain why.</p>
<p>So far as the terms of the amendment are concerned, my hon. Friend is right. If the definition of the mobile telephone in some other piece of legislation is not sufficiently wide to encompass BlackBerrys, for example-one of which I hold in my hand and on which I have been busily communicating with various people during the Committee sittings-it should be wide enough in the Bill. We all use BlackBerrys and know that they can be used to communicate with the outside world. They are not, on the face of it, mobile telephones, unless &nbsp;there is a definition of which I am unaware. My hon. Friend is right to try to extend the definition to include BlackBerrys, laptops and other equipment that is capable of communication with the outside world.</p>
<p>Where I differ with my hon. Friend is as follows. I have a certain amount of experience here, as many years ago I was Prisons Minister for two years and I represent clients in prison, so I see a lot of prisoners. Over the past five years I have seen 50 or so prisoners, usually in prison, and I am familiar with prisons. One has to ask oneself an important question: what is the purpose of prison? The purpose is to punish, but the punishment lies in the deprivation of liberty. I do not believe that that extends to all the ordinary facilities of life. We are certainly not in the business of humiliating prisoners or depriving them of education and work more than need be, and it is terribly important that they retain contact with their families.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree with the proposition that prisoners must be prevented from running criminal activity from inside-that is clearly essential, and often requires the confiscation of all mobile telephones, so that prisoners cannot communicate with people outside. It is at least arguable that they should be prevented from using mobile communications to insult or humiliate people who have been affected by their crimes. That is an interesting proposition, which my hon. Friend made, in part, and I understand that some things that go on Facebook are abusive and might upset victims. However, we need to keep in mind that prisoners must be able to communicate with their families, and there are lots of activities on the internet-accessing information and learning-that I would want to encourage.</p>
<p>The secret lies in the phrase "without authorisation". New section 40D(3A) of the Prison Act 1952, inserted by the clause, refers to</p>
<p class="indent">"A person who, without authorisation, is in possession"</p>
<p>of such a device. It is a matter for the prison governor. He or she should have the ability to see what the prisoner is using the communication device for. If the prisoner is using it for any of the purposes that we have identified as being profoundly wrong, such as organising crime outside, he should be stopped. If he is using it for the sorts of purpose that the prison governor deems to be offensive to the victim or whoever, he should be stopped. However, I do not accept the proposition that we should stop all possession, because that will lead to a greater punishment than I favour.</p>

<p> I respect entirely my right hon. and learned Friend's views. My concern is how such a situation could be monitored. When we have hundreds of prisoners in a jail, how is the prison governor expected to monitor the use of electronic devices? That question has to be answered. Although I agree wholeheartedly that prison should not be used to humiliate people and take away their dignity-they are entitled to a certain standard, as is every human being-I am not convinced about the use of Facebook and free access to the internet for non-educational purposes. Many people cannot use modern electronic devices because they cannot afford to do so. I think that many members of the public would be rather concerned if free access were to be allowed in prison.</p>

<p> I do not twitter and I am not familiar with Facebook. I use e-mails, but I do not have a clue about Facebook and I do not know what one has to pay to &nbsp;twitter. Those things are slightly outside the scope of my knowledge, and I have not the faintest intention of acquiring such knowledge. However, I go back to the broad propositions. It is wrong that people should be able to organise crime from within; that clearly requires them, in certain circumstances, not to have access to electronic communications. I do not want them to say things on their electronic media that distress the victim; I agree with that. But I do not go much further than that. I do not want to restrict their ability to obtain information about prospective jobs or deprive them of the ability to learn about things that might be useful in later life. I certainly do not want to prevent them from maintaining contact with their families.</p>
<p>My hon. Friend made a perfectly fair point about monitoring. I accept that, and it is not easy, but we have to decide where the balance lies. My judgment is that it lies with the prison authorities. The prison governors and officers in charge of the prisoners have to form a view of the sort of characters they are dealing with, and generally speaking, they do. When a prisoner has been in prison a long time and has been reported on by officers over a period of time, they form a fairly clear view of what they are dealing with. It is less easy when people are being moved from prison to prison. I would leave it to the good sense of the governor, without adopting-I hope my hon. Friend will forgive me-the widespread objection that he has raised. I would try to confine my prohibition pretty narrowly.</p>

<p> I thank colleagues for their contributions to the debate. I have some sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Romford and I will certainly consider the amendment. Essentially, we need to provide sufficient scope to ensure that mobile phones and other electronic devices are not used by prisoners in prison. That is why, when I was the Minister responsible for prisons, like the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham was, I took through the Offender Management Act 2007, which banned mobile phones being imported into prison. We do not want a situation wherein prisoners, as well as maintaining contact with their families, which is a noble cause, can undertake communication with the outside world that is intimidatory and threatening, and where murders have been commissioned from prison by prisoners using mobile phones. That is not acceptable, so we need to close that loophole.</p>
<p>That is why this is not only a question of mobile phones being imported into prison and the Offender Management Act 2007; it is about closing the loophole so that individuals caught in possession of a mobile phone in prison face an additional sentence, which is very severe, whether it involves custody and/or other potential measures.</p>
<p>There is great sympathy on that issue. If the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment, I shall consider the issue so that we can draft an amendment on Report that will catch up with a growing technology. When I was first elected to this place 18 years ago, my mobile phone was this big, and now it is that big-probably far too large; for the purposes of <span class="italic">Hansard</span>, I should say that it is 6 or 8 cm wide.</p>

<p> I was going to talk in inches, but I thought that I would show myself as very old if I did that, so I resisted the temptation.</p>
<p>The key thing is the need to future-proof the situation to cover all the electronic technology that will undoubtedly develop in the next few years, which will affect mobile phone use. I shall happily look into the issue if the hon. Member for Romford withdraws the amendment.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington rehearsed an argument that we have wrestled with for years in the prison system: how do we block mobile phones as a whole? We have considered blockers, and have introduced body orifice security scanner, or BOSS, chairs. If we can, we shall, through the Ministry of Justice, consider the idea of telephone blockers, but the difficulty is that prisons are often in urban areas where, just over the wall, live people who have every right to use their phones, which could be blocked. We have been looking at the issue for some time. If the technology is appropriate, my colleagues in the Ministry of Justice will certainly consider it. We have even considered, through a range of activities, increased security and checks, and a range of measures in relation to imports, through the Offender Management Act 2007 and the Bill. We take the issue extremely seriously.</p>
<p>There are occasions when electronic equipment can be used for rehabilitation purposes. The right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham is right: we want people to be able to use computers, think about rehabilitation and look at job opportunities. In prisons, that is undertaken in a controlled environment, under the auspices of the governor. There are controlled circumstances in which such access can happen. The provisions are essentially about stopping individuals from making contact from their cells, through mobile phones, to commission drugs, murder and intimidation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.3.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" speakername="Douglas Hogg" time="16:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s03.htm#100223109000145" colnum="425">
<p> I agree with what the Minister of State and my hon. Friend the Member for Romford say about the undesirable use of mobiles or BlackBerrys, but can I pose a question on a matter of principle? The Minister said that he did not want such devices used in a cell. I understand that. However, if the mobile phone were being used exclusively to speak to the family-and this raises many difficult questions-would that be objectionable?</p>
<p>The answer may be that we cannot so confine it, or that we could not be so sure of the bona fides of the prisoner that we could permit that activity. However, what if those practical arguments-which are real and substantial-were stripped aside, to enable us to ask a narrow question? If we could confine the use just to calling the family, would that be wrong?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.3.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" time="16:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s03.htm#100223109000147" colnum="425">
<p> That poses enormous difficulties for security and the prison, and for the contact. Even if the right hon. and learned Gentleman were to suggest a list of five phone numbers for the family, there is no way in which we could assume that the person at the other end would be the one who should be contacted by the prisoner. It is very difficult to control the use of mobile phones in prison, and for security purposes it would in my view be pernicious to allow their use.</p>
<p>There are methods for contact with families, through personal visits, and there are regular numbers that can be put through normal phones that are available on wings in prisons. It would be very difficult to give sensible consideration to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's proposal given the security issues in a place that is, as the hon. Member for Romford said, ultimately about punishment as well as reform and rehabilitation. It would be very difficult to undertake.</p>

<p> To return briefly to the issue of blocking, will the Minister confirm whether there are time scales during which the blocking technology is being reviewed, and whether there is an implementation programme? He might need to write to members of the Committee about that.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with someone who, until recently, was a prison governor at one of the large London prisons. His view was that the technology worked and that it was more a question of cost than of whether the technology was effective.</p>

<p> I left the Ministry of Justice about nine months ago when it was trialling the position on potential mobile phone blockers. It is an expensive business, but the principle is that if we can do it, we should. For me and for the Ministry of Justice, the question was whether we could make the blockers effective so that they worked in prisons. We need that element of security to know, first, that the technology works in prisons, and secondly whether it would have an impact outside prison. Both points are genuine issues that were being looked at in the trial.</p>

<p> I have a lot of sympathy with the context of the blocker. However, let me say to the Minister of State that when I go into prisons, which I frequently do, I surrender my mobile, which is put into a secure box before I go into the secure area. However, the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington might wish to bear in mind that outside the secure area, but within the prison, we do use our mobiles to contact solicitors or families, or to call a taxi and those sorts of things. That might be an obstacle to the use of the blockers. Once someone is inside the secure area, that is one thing, but they could be just outside it, where hitherto we have all used our mobiles.</p>

<p> The key point is ensuring that the technology works. If it works, it will be looked at. The trialling has been ongoing. We are looking, and have been looking, for a solution, and if we can block signals in a defined area we should do so. However, I do not need to remind hon. Members that Wandsworth prison, Wormwood Scrubs, Liverpool prison in my neck of the woods, and Manchester prison are all next door to residential areas. So is Wakefield prison.</p>

<p> Indeed-so is Chelmsford prison in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I had the pleasure of visiting about 50 prisons during my time as Minister, and I rarely went to a rural location. Most prisons are in neighbourhoods and sometimes have people living close by them in flats. The issue is difficult; we need to find a technological solution that works.</p>
<p>The solutions that we have brought forward have introduced scanners for when people enter prison and increased security measures, training for staff and severe penalties for when, occasionally, mobile phones are brought into prison. Two years ago, a provision was introduced under the Offender Management Act 2007. It means that if someone does manage to smuggle a phone into the prison, through whatever means, or if they are caught with a mobile phone in prison-and I could widen that to include the amendment that looks at electronic communication devices-they will face an additional custodial sentence. That has to be a deterrent.</p>
<p>If I am honest, even with that measure there will be occasions when people will try to get mobile phones. Once this legislation is passed, there will still be those who think that doing so is worth the risk in order to run their businesses from prison or to continue intimidation from prison. We must be continually vigilant.</p>
<p>I cannot guarantee that this clause will stop every mobile phone from getting into prison. However, I can say that we are stopping mobile phones from getting into prisons and that if individuals are found in prison with such a device, they will face a custodial sentence. They will go before the courts; ultimately, people will find themselves facing penalties if they are caught.</p>
<p>We must do what we can to reduce the use of mobile phones in prison, not because we want to deny people family contact, but because mobile phones in prison are by and large used for purposes that are not supported by the state and the Government. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister of State and I hope that the Committee has been reassured by his comments. He has accepted that it is possible for other modern electronic devices to be used to communicate for illegitimate purposes outside prison, and I am pleased that he has said that the loophole should be closed. On the basis that the matter will be looked at closely and considered in the way that has been outlined, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment 174, in clause 42, page 83, line 33, leave out 'take reasonable precautions to'.</p>
<p>We have moved swiftly to the subject of air weapons. Once again, it is an area where I am sure there will be a degree of consensus. It is absolutely right that no young person, whether they are 18 or 14, should have access to an air gun or a weapon of any kind. An adult or older person must ensure the protection of that child in respect of the use of that air gun, and that it is properly monitored.</p>
<p>Sadly, we have seen many accidents in which a young person's managing to obtain an air gun or weapon of some sort has led to the deaths of either themselves or &nbsp;somebody else. There will be no argument from this side of the House about the need to stop young people from using such weapons.</p>
<p>I would like to give one or two examples. Last March, a teenage boy died after being shot with an air rifle in a tragic accident while doing target practice in his back garden. In 2007, Mitchel Picken, who was only 12, was shot dead when his friends were playing with the family air rifle. One has to ask oneself what a family rifle was doing in the garden where very young people were playing games. No responsible adult should ever allow that situation to come about. Another example is from the same year. Danny Marsh, aged 17-slightly older-was supposedly larking around with two friends when their air gun went off accidentally and killed him. That is where any right-minded person would want to see a tightening up of the law.</p>
<p>However, if we are to tighten the law, we must ensure that we do it in a practical and enforceable way. My concern about the clause is with the words "take reasonable precautions"; that is why I tabled the amendment. How is that to be done? I fear that putting those words in the Bill weakens the position. It is better to make it absolutely clear that it is the duty of the adult to prevent such an incident from happening, rather than to take precautions.</p>
<p>An adult may claim that he has taken precautions when he may not have taken nearly enough. Who is to judge what that phrase means? Unfortunately, although the principle of the clause is, I think, supported by everyone in the room, the fact that the words "take reasonable precautions" are in the Bill weakens the clause and will not lead to what we want to see-the end of accidents of this nature. I hope the Minister will consider my point. The amendment would strengthen the legislation, rather than allow it to be weaker, which is what it is as it stands.</p>

<p> I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Romford will not take it personally when I say again that I disagree with him. It is becoming a pattern of mine, and I apologise to him. I hope that he will forgive me if I explain my reasons.</p>
<p>I hold a .22 rifle and several shotguns, and I am duly certificated in respect of all of them. They are held in a steel cabinet. Within the cabinet are a couple of airguns, which I have had since I was a boy. The steel cabinet is locked. We have to dispose of the keys somewhere, but let us assume that a young person finds them, opens up the steel cabinet and takes out the airgun. Is it right that I should be liable under criminal law, having locked the cabinet and put away the keys securely? The answer is manifestly no; I would have taken reasonable precautions as required by the police. The fact that my precautions were undone by a devious juvenile should not make me liable for a criminal offence.</p>
<p>If we accept the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Romford, we would be adopting the principle of what is known as either strict or absolute liability. As a general proposition, I am against strict or absolute liability and I would confine it to the most particular and special of circumstances. I hope that he will reflect that, while some of his examples are perfectly sound, most people-like myself-actually lock up their airguns, &nbsp;although it is not a strict requirement.

<p> My right hon. and learned Friend makes a good point, but my examples are not relevant to it. The guns were not locked away. If the matter ever went to court, any reasonable judgment would be that, if the owner of the gun had locked it in a cabinet and the keys had been stolen, the act would not be considered irresponsible if the owner had taken such precautions.</p>

<p> Forgive me, but my hon. Friend is misunderstanding the nature of his amendment. If it were accepted, the Bill would state that</p>
<p class="indent">"It is an offence for a person in possession of an air weapon"-</p>
<p>such a gun, when in a steel cabinet, is probably in my possession-</p>
<p class="indent">"to fail to prevent any person under the age of eighteen from having the weapon with him."</p>
<p>My hon. Friend would be removing the "reasonable precautions" requirement to say that any failure amounts to an offence. In the circumstances that he clearly outlined to the Committee, the owner of the gun failed to take reasonable precautions. If we leave a gun lying around in our room, but someone takes it and shoots a duck or, much worse, a person, there has been a failure to take reasonable precautions. All such people are caught under what is proposed. I am worried about the person whose reasonable precautions were got round by the young person, but who is still made liable. That cannot be right.</p>

<p> The clause is all about prevention. I am heartened to hear the reassurance from the hon. Member for Romford, who is leading for the Opposition, that he shares our ambition to ensure that weapons that can on occasion cause harm do not get into the wrong hands. I am grateful for his offer of consensus with our aim.</p>
<p>I have two points to make about the effect of amendment 174. Clause 42 requires people to take reasonable precautions to prevent young people from gaining unauthorised access to weapons. The amendment would remove the requirement for reasonable precautions to be taken. That would shift the effect of the offence because it would apply only after a young person had gained access to an air weapon, and that could mean that the damage, including a fatality, had taken place. That is not acceptable.</p>
<p>We want to prevent the damage from being done in the first place, an ambition that I am sure the hon. Gentleman shares. I am in favour of using the law as a deterrent. The offence as he would like to amend it could provide some kind of deterrent, but we want the police to be able to take preventive action where they encounter an unsecured air weapon, rather than wait for a young person to pick it up and risk a tragic accident. I am sure that that would be an unintended consequence of his amendment, but we do not want to wait for the accident or the damage before action is taken.</p>
<p>On the second point, I agree entirely with the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham and he argued very well from personal example. The &nbsp;amendment would mean that an offence would be committed irrespective of any safekeeping measures taken by the owner. We could end up with an injustice whereby someone takes every reasonable step possible, including locking up the weapon in a cabinet, and then somebody gains access to the keys, opens the cabinet, takes the weapon out and causes damage. Therefore, it is our view that the offence ought to be based on the failure to take reasonable precautions. We believe that that would be both a fairer and more proportionate response to the dangers we have mentioned, and would not put such people, whom the right hon. and learned Gentleman made a very responsible plea for, in that position.</p>
<p>On the basis that the amendment would have unintended consequences and could penalise those whom we do not seek to penalise, I hope the hon. Member for Romford will withdraw it.</p>

<p> I thank the Under-Secretary for responding to what was a probing amendment. I felt it necessary to raise the issues and have a debate, albeit brief, and it has been a valuable discussion.

<p> I beg to move amendment 142, in clause 42, page 83, line 34, leave out 'eighteen' and insert 'fourteen'.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that my hon. Friend the Member for Romford is not going to agree with me on this amendment. I might sound a bit old-fashioned about all this, but I think I had my first gun-a single-barrel shotgun, 16. bore-when I was 10. My father was a lawyer and well acquainted with the need to maintain public safety, but he had not the slightest inhibition about giving me that gun for my 10th birthday. I had an airgun, certainly access to an airgun, at about the same age. It is important to keep in mind that at the age of 18 young people can be serving in Afghanistan with modern weaponry on the front line, yet we are saying that, in effect, a person of 18 should not have access to an airgun.</p>
<p>Let us be clear about this. I accept that there are powerful airguns, especially those that are pump operated; I also accept that some are capable of a high penetrative power. Most airguns are not capable of that, although they can cause serious injury-I do not dissent from that view. They are the first weapon people have when they learn to use guns. In the end it is a matter of judgment. I think that 18 is far too old. I made the point that 18-year-olds are serving in Her Majesty's forces in Afghanistan using the most modern weaponry. To then say that that is the age necessary to justify possession of an airgun is, frankly, disproportionate. Whether I am right in saying that 14 is the right age when I had an airgun at 10 is a matter of debate, but I am quite clear that 18 sets the age barrier far too high.</p>

<p> We established in the previous debate that the point of the measures we are introducing is to safeguard people from accidents involving air weapons; &nbsp;we are in common agreement about the need for that. I felt from the right hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks that we were in danger of rerunning earlier debates about the age at which it would be appropriate for someone to have unsupervised possession of an air weapon. Parliament has decided that. The age of 18 was set in the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, which was implemented in October 2007. I remember our long debates then, but Parliament decided that the age limit should be 18. That is notwithstanding the arguments about those who can use other weapons in theatres of war. That is why we have chosen 18. It is the age the law sets out for unsupervised possession of an air weapon.</p>
<p>However, we have stipulated certain circumstances in which people can use air weapons, but under controlled conditions. Someone under 18 can have access to an air weapon and use it when they are supervised by someone aged 21 or over; when they are engaged as a member of an appropriate, approved target-shooting club or in a shooting gallery; or, aged 14 or over, if they are on private premises with the consent of the occupier. Clause 42 will not affect those arrangements. Indeed, subsection (2) makes it clear that the new offence will not apply when the young person is authorised to have an air weapon with him in those circumstances.</p>
<p>The amendment would take away that precautionary element for people aged 15, 16 and 17. Our argument is quite simple: it is as appropriate to secure against improper use by a 15-year-old as by a 14-year-old. The potential for accident or misuse is the same, and that is why we resist the amendment. It is both logical and necessary to have an age limit of 18, and the safeguards should apply. Our proposal does not change the current arrangements for use by young people. Although he may not agree, I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p> I do not disagree and I will withdraw the amendment, if only because I do not wish to suggest for a moment that there is any dissension on the Conservative Benches. I have a feeling that my hon.

As the Conservative party is entirely united on all major issues, this is not a moment to suggest otherwise.

<p> We return to wheel-clamping and the important matter of an independent appeals procedure. The Committee is well aware of our intentions in relation to wheel-clamping. The Security Industry Authority will issue licences to businesses and there will be a code of practice covering issues such as fees for clamp release, towing and impounding, rules on signage warning motorists that they risk being clamped, time limits for towing vehicles, and other conditions governing the circumstances in which a fee can be charged. It will also cover things such as methods of payment, record keeping and the proper consideration of complaints, which is a crucial part of our deliberations.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear that we would expect, as part of the code of practice, that individual businesses, as part of getting their licence, would have a complaints procedure. Therefore, if an individual was clamped and wanted to protest, their first port of call would be the company. However, as is the case with tickets, people sometimes want to go beyond the first level of complaint and seek an independent view of whether they have been clamped properly. We intend to establish an independent complaints procedure with adjudicators who are legally qualified. We have been looking, as I alluded to earlier when talking about my discussions with the Department for Transport, at whether we can piggyback on to an existing tribunal-there is one that deals with ticketing that has legally qualified adjudicators -or whether we can replicate one in a separate form. We accept the need for independent adjudicators. They will be legally qualified, but we have not exactly decided whether they will use the existing system or a new one.</p>

<p> Now is the appropriate time to tax the Minister on the scope of the appeal-I am grateful, Mr. Cook, for your previous guidance.</p>
<p>Proposed new subsection (4) in new clause 10 deals with the grounds that may be relied upon. The Minister will note that they extend to the contravention of a code of practice together with the contravention of any requirement. What I do not see in that subsection is any &nbsp;general discretion given to the adjudicator-if that is the appropriate word-to determine whether it would be right in general terms to waive the charge. Is the adjudicator being given a general discretion to do what is fair, even when the act complained of does not necessarily constitute a breach of the code?</p>

<p> That is certainly our intention. The right hon. and learned Gentleman was not impressed when I suggested earlier that I would look at the issue, but I will look at it. We are absolutely determined that the system gives the rights and protection that motorists seek. There will be a series of things to which the adjudicator will be able to refer in the code of practice, but it would be perfectly reasonable if they were given some discretion, because every case that comes before them will be different in some way. It will not be a cheap system, and if we bring in legally qualified people, we should trust their discretion on such matters. I give the right hon. and learned Gentleman an undertaking that we will look at the issue in the continuing deliberations.</p>
<p>On funding, an independent appeals procedure will cost money. We propose that the scheme will be funded partly by the fees paid by the businesses themselves. When they get a licence, part of that will go towards the set-up costs of the appeals procedure. We also think it is right that, where the businesses lose an appeal, they should be responsible for its cost. They should not get away with the fact that someone has had to go through the appeals procedure to get back money that they should not have lost in the first instance.</p>
<p>I am quite open about this, so let me say to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we are also looking at whether there should be a small-a very small-administrative fee for people who take their case to appeal. We have to protect against vexatious appeals. If we have a system that is entirely open from the moment a vehicle is clamped to the end of the appeal, we have to ensure that people do not automatically decide to go through the appeals procedure. Because there will be an administration cost, we are looking at the possibility of a small fee, bearing in mind that if people win the appeal, they will get back a great deal more than that would cost.</p>

<p> We have looked at this in detail. The main reason is scale. Around one in 10 of people who get parking tickets appeals first to the local authority and then, of that number, one in 10 takes it to the independent appeal. The extent of the ticketing system means that the local authorities can pay for the appeals procedure. We believe that the cost of the appeals procedure for wheel-clamping should be largely-perhaps entirely-met by the businesses themselves through the licensing system. The scale of the local authority set-up means there is a great deal more money compared with the wheel-clamping sector. That is why we were looking to piggyback on that system. We are looking to make the process as affordable as possible, even though we &nbsp;recognise that there could be some money involved. I want to reassure people that most of the cost of the appeal will fall on the businesses themselves. We are bringing the proposal forward in this way because it is a matter for continued discussion and consultation. Having an independent appeals system is very important and gives people confidence.</p>
<p>Amendment 110 ensures that the amendments made to the Private Security Industry Act 2001 providing for appeals against charges for vehicle release extend, like the rest of that Act, to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. As many people will know, however, Scotland bans wheel-clamping, so we are caught in a slight dilemma with regards to extension to other parts of the country. However, the existing wording of the Act means that Scotland will not be caught. It does not need to be, as it does not have wheel-clamping in such a way. However, as we heard in our earlier deliberations, clause 39 is not confined in its potential scope to that sector of the private security industry, since it allows for business licensing to be extended to other sectors. We want to leave the door open for the extension of other sectors, but we appreciate that measures on wheel-clamping will not be necessary for Scotland.

<p> I welcome what the Minister has said and I accept his undertaking to think further about the point I made. One has to ask what criteria the adjudicator-the appellate authority-will have to consider at the appeal. At the moment, proposed new section 22A(4) of the 2001 Act is pretty narrow. It states that the grounds of appeal</p>
<p class="indent">"may include in particular...contravention of a code of practice"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p class="indent">"contravention of any requirement imposed by...this Act".</p>
<p>I would like to another provision to cover any other matter that, in the opinion of the adjudicator, makes it unfair to levy the charge.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Winchester spoke this morning about his constituents who had their vehicles clamped as a result of the snowstorms. If, for example, we left our car in a private place because of the snow-because we could not move it-and it was clamped, we would probably be in breach of the requirements of the clamping authority or the owner, but it would be unfair to require us to pay. I can think of lots of other examples: we might leave our car in a pub car park and fall ill or something so that we could not remove the car immediately; or someone might nick our handbag that had the keys in it, so again we could not move the car. In such circumstances, we would be in breach of the requirements imposed by the occupier, but none the less it would be unfair-if we could justify and prove the facts-to require us to pay the charge.</p>
<p>It is probably important that the Under-Secretary reflects on the matter so that when the provisions are made by regulation, the adjudicator will have sufficient discretion to waive the charge when in her or his opinion levying that charge would be unfair.</p>

<p> Proposed new section 22A(4) states:</p>
<p>However, I take on board what the right hon. and learned Gentleman says. The list is not exhaustive by any means and I shall see what we can do to reassure him.</p>

<p> I understand that point, which is why I have given the right hon. and learned Gentleman such reassurance. However, we have to be careful, because the companies need to know where they are too. If they are carrying things out, they need to know that, while there might be some discretion, they would not be put in the position of genuinely thinking that they were acting within the scope of the code of practice only for someone else to come along later and rule that they were acting outwith what would be, if not the code of practice, a test of reasonableness. I am sure that we can deliberate and see if we can come up with better wording, especially as the matter will be dealt with in regulations.</p>

<p> The inclusion of an independent adjudicator appeals process is something that the Opposition have argued for and supported from day one. We are pleased that it has now been included in the Bill. However, I want to make one or two points.</p>
<p>First, from studying new clause 10, I notice that on numerous occasions the word "may" is used in proposed new section 22A. For example, proposed new subsection (3) states that "appeal may be made", while proposed new subsection (4) states that "grounds may include". Is that word strong enough? If the legislation is to be effective-we all hope it is, because we have debated at length how much of an issue it is to our constituents-is the word "may" as strong as it needs to be? Should not the word "shall" be substituted for it in certain cases, when appropriate?</p>
<p>I also wish to respond to some of the points made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. I agree with him about the situation if people are unable to access their vehicle through no fault of their own, such as because of bad weather. The hon. Member for Winchester made an important point earlier about people's vehicles being immobilised because of snow, and yet being clamped. Any code of practice ought to take such circumstances into account. However, I slightly disagreed with my right hon. and learned Friend when he mentioned people falling ill. If they park in a pub, as he mentioned, and then are ill, we may wonder why they have become ill, so perhaps the legislation should not be quite so lenient in such circumstances.</p>

<p> That would be a matter for the adjudicator.</p>

<p> Indeed, and that is why it is important that the adjudicator has flexibility and is able to judge fairly and take into account all the circumstances while not letting people get away with parking illegally and ensuring that clampers do not use the power they have via the licence to clobber people and extort money unfairly. On that basis, I have no doubt that Members &nbsp;of the House, local authorities and all those engaged in this aspect of legislation will be consulted to ensure that the provisions are effective. Hopefully, MPs' case loads will then be much smaller, as our constituents will not have to complain so regularly.</p>

<p> If the Government go down that route, an independent adjudicator will be required, and I hope that he or she will be as effective as the parking adjudicator, whose role is widely recognised as positive and independent. The Under-Secretary raised the issue of a small charge being levied, and the only word of caution that I have for him is that the charge should not be at such a level as to discourage people from pursuing an appeal if they feel that they have been wrongly clamped.</p>

<p> In response to the hon. Member for Romford's point about the use of the word "may" in proposed new subsection 22A(3), we say that the regulations shall specify the grounds on which an appeal may be made because we hope that people will not need to make an appeal. We leave the door open for that, but we hope that there will be no need to appeal when the regulations are in operation.</p>
<p>The use of the word "may" in proposed new subsection 22A(4) goes back to what I told the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham: the list is not prescriptive. We need to make regulations, which is why "may" is there, but there will be requirements and the regulations will be clearly set out. I shall certainly take on board what he has said.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has no great enthusiasm for the system that we are introducing, but he is right that an independent appeals procedure is needed. Although we are considering the possibility of the appellant paying, I am conscious of the hon. Gentleman's point, and we would not want to put people off appealing. However, if there was a clear way to proceed without any real thought about the cost, there would be a danger of the system being swamped, and we must be careful to prevent that from happening. I acknowledge what he said about the parking adjudicator, which is why we are trying to get as close as possible to that model.</p>

<p> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a figure. I am talking first about the principle of whether we have a charge and then about the general commitment to the bulk of the cost falling throughout the system on the businesses themselves, which, after all, are making the profits. I give the hon. Gentleman the undertaking that if we were to go down that route, the charge would be as small as possible, while nevertheless having the effect of sending out a message about vexatious claims.</p>

<p> There is a lot to be said for the proposition that the unsuccessful party should pay the charges. If private motorists fail, will there be a charge on them? There is a justification for that: it would prevent vexatious appeals.</p>

<p> We considered that, but not for long. In having one's car released and going through the appeals procedure, there is still the risk of facing a hefty bill that would be disproportionate. The process will not come without a cost. We therefore accepted the principle that the businesses should pay. I understand what the right hon. and learned Gentleman is saying, and there is some logic to his suggested system. To avoid the kind of situations that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington hopes that we can avoid, we alighted on the notion of an administrative fee and people should not be expected to pay the full cost of the appeal. We have to get the balance and the proportion right, which is where we are heading.</p>

<p> The amendments and proposed new clauses and schedule provide the framework for a compensation scheme for the victims of overseas terrorist attacks, as announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on Second Reading. Self-evidently, we are introducing the provisions because we wish to ensure that the British victims of overseas terrorist attacks have support from the Government on similar terms to victims of terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Hon. Members will be aware that we have had a criminal injuries compensation scheme for some years. However, it covers only the victims of violent crime, including terrorism, in Great Britain, while a separate scheme operates in Northern Ireland. That has led to a great deal of unfairness, which we seek to address today. We hope never to have to use the provisions, because we hope to prevent further terrorist attacks. A victim of a terrorist attack in this country will be compensated, whereas a British citizen who is the victim of a terrorist attack overseas may have no realistic prospect of securing comparable compensation in the country concerned.</p>

<p> I ought to know the answer to this, but I have not checked the new clause. If the British citizen secures compensation abroad, either from a comparable scheme or, I suppose, through civil litigation, is credit given to the British compensatory authority, so that there is no double recovery?</p>

<p> Yes, and I am grateful to be able to clarify that for the right hon. and learned Gentleman.</p>
<p>Sadly, there have been some serious terrorist attacks overseas that have impacted on British citizens: the Bali attack in 2002, the Sharm el-Sheikh attack in Egypt in 2005, and the latest attack, which we can recall vividly, took place in Mumbai in 2008, when British citizens were, or could have been, killed or injured. The people involved in such attacks are often targeted simply because they are British citizens or western, and we need to bring the compensation scheme in line to reflect that, whether or not they are indiscriminate terrorist activities.</p>
<p>The new victims of overseas terrorism compensation scheme will broadly mirror the domestic criminal injuries compensation scheme. In particular, I envisage that the compensation awarded under the overseas scheme will be calculated on the same basis as the compensation payable under the domestic scheme in force at the time of an overseas terrorist attack. As with the domestic scheme, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, based in Glasgow, will administer the victims of overseas terrorism compensation scheme. Under the existing domestic scheme, adopted in 2008, awards are calculated according to the seriousness of the injury or injuries sustained and, where appropriate, loss of earnings and special expenses.</p>
<p>The trigger for the new scheme will be the designation, by the Foreign Secretary, of an overseas terrorist attack. Such designations will be only for the purposes of the scheme. In deciding whether to designate an attack, the Foreign Secretary will take into account all relevant factors, including-this is an important factor-whether the Foreign Office had advised against travel to the area where the attack took place.</p>
<p>As we are dealing with overseas terrorist attacks, we believe that the focus of the scheme should be on compensating British citizens. In addition to British citizens, we will also cover, in fulfilment of our European treaty obligations, EU and EEA nationals with sufficient connections to the United Kingdom. We are currently considering what the eligibility criteria should be.</p>
<p>The proposed national statutory scheme will take effect, in the event of Royal Assent, from 18 January 2010, which was the date of the Bill's Second Reading, when my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced the new scheme. I hope that it will be a positive development from 18 January. Many British citizens have been victims of terrorist attacks in recent years, some of which I referred to earlier, such as those in Sharm el-Sheikh and Bali. They continue to face hardship as a result of the ongoing consequences of a disability arising from injuries that they sustained in those terrorist attacks. Such victims will not be able to claim compensation under the statutory scheme provided for in the new clauses. We have concluded that if the scheme is enacted, we should also provide some financial recompense to those victims who continue to live with the consequences of the injuries that they sustained. It is important that we recognise that, although we cannot make clauses retrospective.</p>
<p>Accordingly, my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary has established a time-limited scheme open to those eligible who were injured in designated terrorist attacks abroad since 1 January 2002. He will develop and establish a scheme following Royal Assent. I should stress that that will be a wholly separate arrangement from the new statutory scheme. We will not be retrospectively legislating on these matters, but we feel that awards payable under the time-limited scheme should be made. In these circumstances, the awards payable will be put in place by my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary. There will be no awards to those who were bereaved in past attacks or to those who were injured and have now recovered. I accept that that will be a difficult situation for many individuals, but we will ensure that for those with an ongoing disability, one-off payments will be made, calculated by reference to the tariff based on the seriousness of the injury or injuries that we have indicated in previous discussions today. No payment will be made for the loss of earnings or special expenses. That will be a disappointment-I accept that it will be difficult-but I hope that the Committee will accept that we are legislating for a new scheme from January and that we are making strenuous efforts to ensure that we can help individuals who have ongoing difficulties.</p>

<p> May I make one point, which, I am sure, the Minister already has in mind? It is important that the sums payable under the scheme should not exceed the sums available to members of the armed services who are injured in conflict. If that were to happen, there would be a terrible row. People are rightly very sensitive about compensation payable to servicemen, and there would be the most appalling row if servicemen received less compensation than other British citizens who are injured overseas.</p>

<p> As I have said, any payment made will be on par with a tariff, which is a well-established practice to date. My understanding is that that will not be higher than individual service awards. I will certainly take those points on board and reflect upon them in due course. I am advised that the armed forces scheme is even more generous than the criminal injuries compensation scheme. There is no opportunity for an overlap, which would be detrimental to those brave individuals who serve in our armed forces. We aim to establish the time-limited scheme for victims of attacks since 2002 as quickly as possible once we have enacted the statutory scheme. I hope that that will be helpful.</p>
<p>I hope that the Committee will agree to the new clauses and amendments. I hope that we never have to implement the provisions, for the simple reason that we do not wish terrorist attacks to occur. None the less, I hope that the Committee will recognise that the Government have made an effort to ensure fairness for those who may be injured in terrorist attacks, and to offer some help to those who have ongoing difficulties as a result of terrorist attacks.</p>

<p> I share the Minister's sentiment when he said that we hope that the provisions outlined in the new clause will not be necessary; if they are, it will mean that some form of terrorist &nbsp;action will have taken place overseas and that British people will have been caught up in it. However, the sad reality is that it may happen, and I note the sensitive way in which the Minister approaches the matter.</p>
<p>For me, the Second Reading debate was marked by the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), whose brother was caught up in one such terrorism atrocity. That highlighted the personal issues that can result from those appalling actions, and the impact they can have. We obviously support the work of our security services, our armed forces and the other law enforcement agencies in seeking to ensure that our fellow countrymen and women are protected against such appalling actions.</p>
<p>We recognise the call for support made by those who fall victim to appalling acts of violence abroad who would have received a financial contribution if those acts had occurred in this country. I hear what the Minister said about the new provisions and, as I said on Second Reading, we will reflect closely on them.</p>
<p>I note that the Government have considered the matter and have moved from their previous approach of suggesting that a statutory compensation scheme for British victims of overseas terrorism was not necessary because European legislation required member states to apply compensation to any victims of terrorist acts within their territories. That goes only so far. A number of incidents have occurred outside the bounds of the European Union and the European economic area, and it is in that context that the Government have reflected on the representations made to them and have proposed the scheme outlined in the new clauses.</p>
<p>The provisions were initially announced in a Ministry of Justice press release, and the Home Secretary noted on Second Reading that the Government would be bringing forward proposals. As the Minister said, the scheme is intended to apply not only to UK nationals but to nationals of other EU member states and other countries in the EEA that have sufficient connection with the United Kingdom. I assume that will be based on shared arrangements in meeting treaty obligations, and that we will almost have reciprocity-the arrangements possibly being utilised by other member states.</p>

<p> Could one not be more robust? We could say something to the effect that citizens of an EU state should not be entitled to make a claim under the scheme unless the state to which the claimant belonged had a reciprocal arrangement that would enable UK citizens to make a claim.</p>

<p> As always, my right hon. and learned Friend makes an important point. If individual schemes operate in other EU member states, is there some ability to share in any payments that are made? Should there be some sort of credit? How would individual schemes operate across the EU? If a resident of another EU state is entitled to claim under the UK scheme, should there be an arrangement to seek recompense from that other member state, so that there is a level playing field across the EU? It would be interesting to hear from the Minister on that point about the application of the scheme.</p>
<p>Clearly, the proposal is intended as a fall-back or safety net for when the country where the incident has occurred does not fulfil its European or international &nbsp;obligations. We seek assurances that all steps will be taken to ensure that countries do not ignore their responsibilities under their own schemes. It is interesting to note, for example, that in 2008-09 awards to the value of &#163;539,491 were made under the criminal injuries compensation scheme to overseas residents who were victims of terrorism in the UK. The UK is clearly meeting its responsibilities in that regard, and it is important to ensure that other countries step up to the plate and similarly respect their liabilities and responsibilities. I will listen carefully to how the Minister envisages the operation of the scheme in that context, and to what discussions he has had with colleagues about the international application of the relevant procedures.</p>
<p>It would also be interesting to hear whether the Minister has had any discussions with the insurance market about terrorism exemptions in insurance policies, and about the interrelationship of the proposed scheme with other insurance that may or may not be available. From what he has said to my right hon. and learned Friend, I imagine that the Minister envisages that if payment is received from other sources, it would act as a credit against sums or payments that might be due under the scheme. It is important to understand that better. Equally, if payment is made under the scheme, and further subsequent payment is made either by the host country or other sources, how is it envisaged that that would operate in practice?</p>
<p>As we understand from statements in the Ministry of Justice press release, and from what the Minister has said, it is intended that the scheme be administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, based in Glasgow. The Minister may be aware that in the recent past, that organisation has come in for scrutiny and some criticism by the Public Accounts Committee. A PAC report made 14 recommendations relating to the performance of the criminal injuries compensation scheme. For example, the PAC highlighted issues such as the fact that some of the forms needed to use plain English, that some applicants felt that they needed to be legally represented in order to make an application and receive compensation from the CICA, and that there were performance issues regarding the answering of telephones. Obviously, if we now add the new requirements for victims of overseas terrorism to the obligations, responsibilities and administration of the criminal injuries compensation scheme and the authority, it would be helpful to know how the CICA has responded to previous criticisms.</p>
<p>I know that the Ministry of Justice had been seeking to set up action plans to respond to the criticisms made by the PAC and, through the Committee, the National Audit Office. We are trying to ensure that should the scheme come into effect, and compensation is due to those who suffer horrendously from incidents abroad, the process should be clear and understood, and that no obstacles should be put in the way by the operation or administration of the CICA. Therefore, it will be helpful to hear from the Minister how the authority is responding. How does he anticipate that the CICA will operate under the scheme to ensure that claims are made as painlessly as possible in terms of paperwork, and that claimants can contact the CICA for advice, guidance and assistance getting through the process, without feeling that recourse to legal advice is necessary?</p>
<p>The Minister said that the levels of compensation will, in broad measure, reflect the existing criminal injuries compensation scheme. Will certain exclusions apply to the operation of the new scheme, similar to those that apply in the existing scheme? New clause 13 states:</p>
<p class="indent">"The Scheme may make provision about a person's eligibility for a payment under it by reference to any or all of the following factors",</p>
<p>including</p>
<p class="indent">"any other factors that the Secretary of State considers appropriate".</p>
<p>My understanding is that under the criminal injuries compensation scheme, there could, for example, be a question about whether a previous conviction was relevant in deciding about the award of a payment. It would be helpful to understand what is meant by the detail of the proposed scheme-whether it will reflect principles similar to those in the existing one.</p>

<p> That is an important point. It would help us if the Minister could amplify on it. I do not want to disqualify someone simply because they have a criminal conviction in the past, but if a person happened to be, for example, running drugs when he was caught up in an explosion, I would not be sympathetic to his claim for compensation. That is the sort of issue that has to be spelt out.</p>

<p> My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right. The Minister has set out the broad mapping of how he envisages the operation of the scheme. He said that it would broadly follow the existing criminal injuries compensation scheme. That is helpful, but it would be even more helpful if it was set out in further detail.</p>
<p>My right hon. and learned Friend made an important point that I was intending to raise-the issue of service personnel. I understand that there was originally some delay in proposing the scheme regarding the interrelationship with the armed forces compensation scheme for the appalling incidents that we have seen in Afghanistan, such as roadside bombings, which could be considered terrorist insurgent action. How does the Minister see the interrelationship between the scheme for compensation for service personnel and this scheme? As I understand it, the proposed scheme is separate and would not apply to service personnel-they would be excluded because they are already entitled to apply to another scheme. There would thus be no overlap between the two schemes. It would be helpful to have it set on the record that that is the intention of the proposals.</p>

<p> My hon. Friend is clearly right, but individuals such as journalists may be embedded with UK forces. Under which scheme will they make a claim? It is important that they do not receive more than service people.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.42" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000275" colnum="443">
<p> The Minister says that he anticipates that the payments under the scheme would be less than those that go to service personnel. Obviously, there would be a need to spell out in the detail of the regulations and the scheme what exclusions would apply and, if someone were in a theatre of conflict, whether &nbsp;there would be application under one scheme or the other. It is just a matter of ensuring for definitional purposes that the details are made clear.</p>
<p>It is open to the Secretary of State, as stated under new clause 11, to make the requirements to designate whether a particular incident is to be covered under the scheme. We can debate if the provision is too loosely worded about whether the Secretary of State may or may not designate, although I appreciate that certain facts and circumstances might need to be established if something is to be regarded as a terrorist incident. That is why defining the scheme and the application of new clause 11 will become important.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.43" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" speakername="Douglas Hogg" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000277" colnum="443">
<p> May I try something out on my hon. Friend? There will be several situations in which people-journalists or whoever-are working in conflict or danger zones as part of their job. There would be a case for saying that such persons should be required to take insurance so that the scheme can get the credit for the insurance payment. For example, it could be said that a journalist embedded with the forces should be insured against the damages that they suffer, otherwise the whole cost would fall on the scheme.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.44" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000278" colnum="443">
<p> Hence the reason for my earlier comment to the Minister about what consideration he had given to the availability of insurance. In certain circumstances, people might not be able to obtain cover in the insurance market and, in that context, perhaps the Government would consider the scheme as the safety net. The point about credits or recompense through other routes is relevant and one that we have touched on in the debate, so it will be interesting to hear from the Minister about how that will operate in practice.</p>
<p>The Government have determined that they accept their moral obligation to recompense people caught up in acts of terrorism abroad, but they are not seeking to recompense victims of serious crime that is not terrorist action or atrocity. Will the right hon. Gentleman explain why the Government have sought to take the approach of looking at the criminal injuries compensation scheme and saying that they are prepared to accept it to a certain extent, but not in relation to other circumstances? It would be genuinely interesting to hear the Minister's thoughts about the logic and the process and how, in the terms of definition, an action could be a terrorist action or violent crime. Perhaps the Secretary of State will contemplate such matters by virtue of the provision embedded in new clause 11 that gives him discretion to decide whether something is caught by the scheme. It would be helpful to understand the limits and scope of what is intended, and the approach that has been taken.</p>
<p>I turn now to a couple of more detailed points about the new clauses. I understand that the provisions would not prevent ex gratia payments from being made, should the Government determine that appropriate. Subsection (3) of new clause 11 states that</p>
<p class="indent">"Nothing in this section affects any power of the Secretary of State to make payments to, or in respect of, persons who are injured as a result of terrorism outside the United Kingdom."</p>
<p>Does that still allow discretion for some element of ex gratia payment over and above the compensation scheme, or has that provision been included for another reason? I want to understand the logic that is being applied.</p>
<p>Going back to the point about the Secretary of State having discretion to decide whether it would be appropriate to designate the particular act to ensure that compensation would be payable under the scheme, what sort of factors does the Minister anticipate, because obviously the provision has been drafted with some thought? What sorts of exclusions are anticipated regarding reserving that right of the Secretary of State to determine that something should not be covered?</p>
<p>New clause 18 makes it clear that any scheme under these provisions would need to be laid before Parliament. What thought has been given to the pre-consultation that should be carried out in relation to the scheme? Once it is laid before Parliament, we would not be able to amend it under the anticipated procedures, so does the Minister plan to have a formal consultation procedure on the scheme to ensure that relevant points can be incorporated before it is finalised?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.45" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" speakername="Douglas Hogg" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000284" colnum="444">
<p> May I make a further suggestion that my hon. Friend proposes to the Minister that it would be a good idea if the scheme could be debated in draft before it was laid in its final form before the House?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.46" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000285" colnum="444">
<p> The Minister might be able to clarify this, but new clause 18 states that the scheme cannot be made unless a draft has been approved by a resolution of each House. Therefore, it seems that a draft would need to be laid and approved by both Houses before it could come into effect. The point that I was making was that the draft would be laid, but it could not be amended, so it would have to be accepted or rejected.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.47" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1821" speakername="Douglas Hogg" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000286" colnum="444">
<p> I think that new clause 18 refers to the draft that becomes the final resolution. What sometimes happens, as my hon. Friend will know, is that Governments come forward with a draft that is debated, but not necessarily voted upon. The Government then take it away and incorporate into the final draft such changes as they deem appropriate as a consequence of the debate-that was what I had in mind.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.48" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000287" colnum="444">
<p> Equally, my right hon. and learned Friend will be aware of the process whereby a Select Committee can consider a draft Bill or draft orders. I am trying to make the point that there should be an opportunity for debate to facilitate the best operation of the scheme and to ensure that relevant points can be fed into the process. The Minister might be planning a formal consultation period that would facilitate that and there might be some parliamentary involvement. Given the interest that many right hon. and hon. Members have in the subject, they may want to have such engagement. At the very least, there should be a process to facilitate such input to ensure that the scheme will be more effective and will take those issues into account.</p>
<p>I will listen carefully to what the Minister says in response to this debate because this is an important issue. We must reflect carefully on those people who have suffered in terrorist incidents overseas. There is an issue of fairness. If such an incident had occurred in the UK, they would be entitled to compensation, but because it took place overseas in a territory that does not have a scheme to provide compensation directly, there is a &nbsp;clear gap. I recognise the moral issue here, which I am sure is part of the reason why the Government have brought forward these proposals.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.49" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000289" colnum="445">
<p> I welcome the proposals, although I note the restrictions applying to retrospective compensation. When considering what compensation to provide, going back to 2002, were any estimates made of the number of people anticipating being included, but who are not included?</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Hornchurch raised a large number of interesting points about the way in which the proposals interlink with existing schemes-EU schemes, insurance schemes, and the interface with the service personnel scheme-and whether the principle of non-payment to people with previous convictions that applies in relation to criminal compensation is to be extended to this scheme. He raised a number of valid points to which I am sure that the Minister will want to respond.</p>
<p>I would like to echo another issue raised by the hon. Gentleman that is slightly outwith what we are debating, although I hope that you will allow me one or two sentences on it, Mr. Cook. The Government have established the principle of compensating British citizens who are victims of a heinous crime abroad-terrorism. The hon. Gentleman made a strong point about the deliberations the Government went through to arrive at the restriction to victims of terrorism abroad. The Minister might be aware of a case involving the son of one of my constituents who was attacked and seriously injured when he was on holiday in Malia in Crete. We had a meeting in Westminster a couple of weeks ago to look at the issue of victims of crime abroad. A regrettably large number of British citizens have been affected by crime in Greece. I would like to know whether the Government have considered taking the remit beyond victims of terrorism into other areas of serious crime. The Minister has a number of challenging points to respond to, but the principle he has set before us is one that I think all Members will support.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.50" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" time="18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s07.htm#100223109000292" colnum="445">
<p> I am grateful for the broad level of support from the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Carshalton and Wallington. They raised a range of points and I will try to respond in due course.</p>
<p>The compensation scheme is first and foremost designed for British victims and their families. I recognise that we have obligations under European Union treaties. Article 18 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union expressly states that we may not discriminate against citizens of other member states on the grounds of their nationality, and there is case law on that. Through the proposals I have brought before the Committee, we are trying to ensure that individuals from abroad who are eligible for this scheme should have strong links with the United Kingdom, and those strong links are defined by case law.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Hornchurch mentioned the important point of travel insurance. Travel insurance is not designed to provide compensation in the way in which the scheme is designed to do. If I am asked the straightforward question of whether individuals should take out travel insurance, the answer is yes, they should. They should also check that it covers terrorist activity, &nbsp;which around a third of travel insurance schemes currently do. As I have already indicated, if alternative methods of finance are provided, the scheme will take that into account when determining the awards.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Hornchurch asked whether the eligibility for criminal convictions would be similar. The existing UK criminal injuries compensation scheme will be the basis for the scheme operating abroad, which will have similar provisions.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman commented on the ability of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority to deal with the claims. I have every confidence that it will be able to do so. It aims to provide compensation as quickly as possible, not just as a matter of course but because it is important that the compensation goes to individuals who require it. Last year, the average time for the authority to decide an application was about nine months and 57 per cent. of applications were decided within eight months. To put that into context, last year 36,461 compensation awards were made in the UK, and since 2002 about 300 of our people have been killed or injured abroad because of terrorist activity. I hope that it never happens but, looking at past form, the increase in the authority's work load would be relatively minor and within its ability to cope.</p>
<p>A number of Members mentioned the armed forces compensation scheme, which is entirely separate from the victims of overseas terrorism compensation scheme. A member of the armed forces injured while on active service would expect to apply to the armed forces scheme and not to the victims of overseas terrorism compensation scheme. We had an interesting discussion about people who might be embedded within the armed forces, working for them as journalists or civilian contractors. We would expect contractors and journalists to be covered by private employer insurance schemes, and in the unlikely event that they were not, the Foreign Secretary would have to consider whether to include them in his designation of terrorist activity. To clarify, the Foreign Secretary, when determining a designation, will consider the identity of the attacker, the design and purpose of the attack, the nature and circumstances of the attack, and the broad thrust of why the attack took place.</p>
<p>The provision will allow ex gratia payments-payments to be made outside the scheme-which were again mentioned by the hon. Member for Hornchurch. An existing Ministry of Defence scheme and Foreign and Commonwealth Office exceptional assistance are both covered, and the Secretary of State for Justice will be able to introduce the arrangements that I mentioned on Second Reading for some of those injured since 2002.</p>
<p>Consultation was mentioned by both the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham and the hon. Member for Hornchurch. As I have said on numerous occasions, we are modelling the system on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority scheme, which is a natural scheme in practice, and on which we do not need further consultation. We will lay draft orders before the House for approval or otherwise, and I do not want at this stage to commit to full-blown consultation. The principles are established and we do not consult on the current CICA scheme. Furthermore, I do not want to delay the introduction of the scheme. I want it to be operational for anybody who is a victim of a terrorist attack in the near future.</p>
<p>I am trying to think as quickly as I can to cover the points that have been mentioned. Overall, the scheme should be welcomed, and I commend it to the Committee.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman pins me down on an issue that I was not trying to avoid, but was not keen to explore in great detail. We have had to make some considerations on all the matters. Resources are always limited and we have to consider the issues in the round. We have determined that there is a difference between terrorist attacks at home and terrorist attacks abroad, and we have therefore decided to support the scheme. It is right that we should make provisions for British victims of terrorist attacks abroad.</p>
<p>There is a tangible expression of outrage when a terrorist attack occurs, and I recognise that such injuries need to be considered in detail. We have to consider the wider picture, however. I cannot give a commitment to extending the CICA scheme to victims of ordinary crime abroad. We have tried to make terrorism a special circumstance. I hope that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington will accept that that is progress, even if he wishes us to pursue the matter further. I commend the new clauses to the Committee.</p>

<p> Government amendment 175 ensures that Government new clause 10 will extend only to England and Wales. Government amendment 176 is merely consequential. I hope that the Committee will forgive me for spending a little time speaking to these measures, as we did not have the opportunity to discuss the matter on Second Reading.</p>
<p>Government new clause 31 would amend the Licensing Act 2003 by inserting five new sections. New section 172A will provide licensing authorities, almost all of which are local authorities, with the power to ban sales or supplies of alcohol between 3 am and 6 am, either in the whole of its area or in a smaller, more confined part of it. The provisions require that such an order may not be made unless certain preconditions are met; I shall return to those shortly.</p>
<p>The effect of an order would be to override the effect of any premises licence, club premises certificate or temporary event notice otherwise authorising sales or supplies at that time in the early morning. We have &nbsp;chosen to restrict such bans to the period between 3 am and 6 am as a result of the findings of an evaluation of the 2003 Act that was published in March 2008. In a written statement to Parliament, the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), said of the 2003 Act:</p>
<p class="indent">"Its introduction has not led to the widespread problems some feared. Overall, crime and alcohol consumption are down. But alcohol-related violence has increased in the early hours of the morning and some communities have seen a rise in disorder."-[<span class="italic">Official Report</span>, 4 March 2008; Vol. 472, c. 102W.]</p>
<p>The evaluation reported an increase in the number of offences committed between 3 am and 6 am that was small in absolute terms, at 236 incidents, but large in proportionate terms at about 25 per cent. Our intention is not unnecessarily to restrict or inhibit the night-time economy, which is often important to local economies, but to focus sharply on the problem that has been identified.</p>
<p>Returning briefly to the preconditions, first, the order must be necessary for the promotion of one or more of the four statutory licensing objectives. I remind the Committee that they are: the prevention of crime and disorder; public safety; the prevention of public nuisance; and the protection of children from harm.</p>
<p>Secondly, new section 172B requires the licensing authority to advertise the proposed order and to consider at a hearing any relevant representations made to it by any of three different groups. The Secretary of State is empowered under the new section to prescribe the detailed procedure governing how and when relevant representations should be made and how they will be processed. Under the provisions, representations are relevant if they concern the likely effect of the order on the statutory licensing objectives, and are made in the prescribed form and within the prescribed time.</p>
<p>Of the three groups that may make representations, the first includes any persons affected by the order, which means the licence and club certificate holders, people who give temporary event notices, and the holders of provisional statements. The second group includes responsible authorities-for example, the police and environmental health officers. The third group comprises interested parties, including residents or other businesses in the vicinity of the affected premises. It also includes local councillors who are members of the licensing authority. Where no relevant representations are received, the licensing authority will be free to make the order it had proposed and advertised, but, where representations have been received, the licensing authority must hold a hearing before finalising its decision. The arrangement for such a hearing will be set out in the regulations.</p>
<p>The legislation was passed in 2003 and came into force in November 2005, so it has been in force for more than four years. At the time it was enacted, the Government promised to keep its impact under close scrutiny. The new measure is designed, in the light of our evaluation, to extend the powers that we originally gave to licensing authorities. The question has been asked whether we expect the power to be widely used. The answer is no, we do not. The 2003 Act has been a considerable success in many areas and we believe that the existing powers in the Act are sufficient in those areas. In other areas, however, we need to go further.</p>
<p>There are 378 licensing authority areas. In the case of public bars, pubs and nightclubs, some 73 per cent. of those licensing areas have either one or no premises licensed for 24 hours. Nationally, we believe that no more than 3 per cent. of licensed premises trade between 3 am and 6 am. That suggests that no more than 6,000 premises would be affected if every area made such an order, which is highly unlikely. Our approach, therefore, is targeted and proportionate.</p>
<p>Some local authorities, however, have more demanding night-time economies, and they tell us that they would welcome the power to manage crime and antisocial behaviour better, in the interests of their residents. There is a general principle that we wish to empower local people to have an even stronger say in what their towns and cities are like, particularly in the early hours of the morning. It is fair to ask, in anticipation, why we are not giving licensing authorities a free hand to set their own hours of closure when making orders. We believe that the measures are reasonable and proportionate. We do not want to create unjustified problems for businesses that are emerging from recession, or provoke job losses, unless there is a good, evidence-based reason.</p>
<p>As for why we are centring on the hours between 3 am and 6 am, a fixed closing time of 3 am minimises the disruption to businesses, with only those trading between 3 am and 6 am potentially affected. We believe that 3 am is late enough to allow closing times and departures from licensed premises to be staggered, which the police continue to value as a support for dispersing large numbers of people from city and town centres. Moreover, 3 am should be sufficiently late not to interfere with plans for wedding receptions and other special celebrations that may continue later than a normal evening's pleasure. At the other end of the closure period, 6 am allows people to sell alcohol with breakfast. It may come as a surprise to some that that is a habit, but I am told that champagne breakfasts sometimes have an appeal for tourists. People celebrating Christmas might also decide that they want a particularly early start, so 6 am offers that flexibility and allows the period for closure.</p>
<p>New section 172E will allow the Secretary of State to make an order exempting certain cases and circumstances from the effects of an order made under new section 172A. Those cases and circumstances will be defined in particular by reference to certain types of premises and certain days. On certain premises, hotels have always been free to supply alcohol to their residential guests, so we think that they should be exempt from the arrangements. Moreover, we would not want to exempt sales made to the general public at certain other premises. Warehouses to which the public have no access for purchasing alcohol, for example, hold 24-hour licenses and operate after 3 am. Such premises may be distribution centres for wine purchased over the internet or by mail order, with the goods sometimes starting their journeys in the small hours. We would expect such premises to be exempt because they do not present any obvious danger to the licensing objectives.</p>
<p>As for particular days, we would consider appropriate for exemption new year's eve every year and specific days such as the diamond jubilee weekend of 2012, for &nbsp;which occasion it might be suitable to exempt days, but-I stress this point-the effect would not be that all licensed premises can trade between 3 am and 6 am on the exempted days. The effect of an exemption would be that the normal permission for such licences and certificates would be in force. Thus, premises whose hours have always been restricted by their licences and certificates would continue to be restricted despite the existence of an exemption on the day or days.</p>

<p> I am gratified that the Minister had the good grace to accept that the provisions in the new clause are likely to have limited effect. I hope, for his sake, that they will not have the same limited effect as the new alcohol disorder zone provisions, none of which has been used at all.</p>
<p>I appreciate and recognise that the Government, by virtue of the provisions, accept that they got 24-hour licensing wrong. The Minister rightly identified the increase in violent crime between 3 am and 6 am-from the DCMS report-which is tantamount to admitting why the Government are introducing the new clause. They are right to take action. We have seen not just the rise in crime but the rise in hospital admissions of patients with an alcohol-related diagnosis-between 2004-05 and 2008-09 such admissions went up by 47 per cent. Similarly, the number of children admitted has risen, and death rates from alcohol have increased by 47 per cent. since 1997.</p>
<p>The provisions are an admission and recognition of the problems caused by the Government's approach. I appreciate what the Minister said about keeping things under review, but the situation is not one they have woken up to overnight, because the problems relating to the small hours of the morning were first identified in July 2007. Why have the Government taken so long to act? Furthermore, incidents that occur at that time are likely to be the result of drinking much earlier in the evening-the whole concept of pre-loading and the consumption of alcohol in the home. Although the problems might be exhibited in the hours between 3 am and 6 am, it does not mean that the alcohol was consumed then. When we understand that, we see a much wider problem than the Minister alluded to.</p>
<p>I have a few comments on the specifics of the new proposals, but I do not intend to use this afternoon's sitting for that wider debate, because it would not necessarily be appropriate or in order. However, proposed new section 172A in new clause 31, states:</p>
<p class="indent">"If the licensing authority considers it necessary for the promotion of the licensing objectives, it may"</p>
<p>take the relevant action. From what the Minister said, that appears to be tied to the four licensing objectives, but I want to understand that a little better. The DCMS press release of 4 February 2010 stated:</p>
<p class="indent">"Councils would need to show that the restriction was necessary to prevent crime and disorder or public nuisance or to promote public safety."</p>
<p>What obligation does that place on councils? Can they make a restriction if they consider it necessary, or must the necessity be demonstrated with objective evidence? In other words, is the provision likely to be fettered by guidance that would sit alongside it, which would make it very difficult for a council to show that evidence and to rely on the provisions set out in the new clause.</p>
<p>We have heard, in the review from the DCMS, that there were just 470 pubs, bars and nightclubs with 24-hour licences, but there was no evidence that more than a handful operate on that basis. If there were so few licensees trading or operating during that time, how would a council be able to demonstrate that the four criteria-the licensing objectives-would meet the hurdle that the Government appear to be setting up? Would it create a restriction on the utilisation of the powers, even if a council wished to do so? It is all very well putting down in legislation that new powers exist, but if the bar is set so high for councils to satisfy the relevant criteria-to go through the procedures that the Minister has alluded to-the likelihood is that they will not bother, even if they feel that it might be useful or helpful for them to do so.</p>
<p>The whole of that fettering-all the other arrangements that sit alongside the provisions-is germane. We have seen guidance fetter local councils in their ability to utilise the staggered arrangements alluded to by the Minister. In essence, the council always has to prove why a licence should not be granted, rather than a licensee having to prove why they should be granted the licence in the first place. It is about balance and discretion. Therefore, although I welcome and appreciate the fact that the Government recognise that a change needs to be made, the question is what impact it will have and whether the provisions will actually be used at all.</p>

<p> The proposal is recognition that we are not yet ready for continental-style 24-hour licensing. The measures needed before that change were not in position. It is not entirely clear to me whether this change-the restriction that will now apply between 3 am and 6 am-will actually achieve what the Government intend. They have previously stated that the provision was to try to address peaks of violence associated with drinking. It is clear from evidence supplied from Guildford that the peaks of violence happen earlier than the 3 am to 6 am slot, so it will not address the problem in that city, or presumably in others.</p>
<p>Underlying the change is the need to deal with other fundamental problems of alcohol consumption that have not been addressed-pricing, promotions, advertising, the strength of alcohol and under-age drinking. Those are matters that I am sure we would all like to debate, Mr. Cook, but you would not allow us to do so. It is possible that the change will make a slight dent in the problems associated with irresponsible drinking, but I think it will be a slight dent only and there are still many major issues that we need to address.</p>

<p> I anticipated to some extent the points that the hon. Member for Hornchurch made. We had a fairly substantial rehearsal on the Floor of the House when we debated the programme motion. He cites alcohol disorder zones as evidence of the worthlessness of such actions, but he knows as well as I do that they are a very useful stick with which to prod, if not to beat, local licensing committees and agencies involved in making town and city centres safer. They are to some extent, the ultimate weapon to have at one's disposal, because they bring with them a certain stigma about what a town or city centre might be like. Quite often, partners will go to almost any length-in other words, make the improvements they have been offering to make but never quite got round to-to manage a problem &nbsp;in a town and city centre and fall short of becoming an alcohol disorder zone. I will not, therefore, dismiss alcohol disorder zones, as clearly I would not want anybody to dismiss the measures either.</p>
<p>I refute the suggestion that the Government got all of it wrong; that denies the change in behaviour for the better in many towns and cities throughout the country. It is not the case that every town and city centre is an alcohol-fuelled wild west. That would be unfair to the police and those in local authorities who take the matter seriously. A lot of people need to take it more seriously, but many do a good job. If further measures are necessary, they need to be targeted and proportionate, which includes referring to times when there are specific problems.</p>
<p>We have not just woken up to the issue. As I explained to the hon. Member for Hornchurch on the Floor of the House, he must accept that the development of policy in such an important area as tackling alcohol-related disorder is a never-ending continuum. We want to get it absolutely right, often with the advice of the police and others on how best we can do so. Pre-loading is a worry. However, if we decided to close bars and clubs at the point when people were arriving in a pre-loaded state, we would be moving the measures to much earlier- 10 or 11 o'clock at night. That would not be proportionate or necessary.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman asked why we needed an evidence base to support such an order. That is how the licensing system works. It is an evidence-based system. Police and others need to bring forward evidence that there is a problem. Sometimes in my area there is a difference between the views of the trade, as we would expect, and how bad the situation is for residents and how bad it is for the police. Nevertheless, it is important that such matters are based on evidence and not the whim of a party. We do not expect the measure to be used hugely, because a lot of things can be used to deal with single premises or a few premises in an area, but only when the perception of a general problem in a city or town centre is such that those responsible for making the decision at local level believe that it would be helpful. That is why we want the provision in the Bill.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is absolutely right to put the provision in the context of all the other things we need to discuss and act on to tackle alcohol in our society, including pricing. However, the matter is not about pricing, but what happens in town and city centres between 3 am and 6 am. Evidence suggests that one of the down effects of the changes to licensing was an uplift in the statistics on alcohol-fuelled violence. It is therefore right to introduce the measure.</p>

<p> I do not dispute the effect to which the Minister refers, but presumably he is not disputing the fact that in some of our towns and cities, the uplift in violence happens at an earlier stage so the hours between 3 am to 6 am miss the peak in violence.</p>
</speech>

<p> That time does not miss the peak in violence because, in reality, there was also an uplift during the hours that we are addressing. I am not disputing the fact that in the early morning there are problems in some towns and cities. Measures can be brought into play at such times but, because of the uplift at a particular time of the early morning and &nbsp;because we want a proportionate response, we believe that between 3 am and 6 am is the right time for the measure. If the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is arguing that the police and local authorities will be knocking on our door asking whether the timing is right and will we be considering extending the measure to other times, I cannot read into that. All I am saying is that we believe that there is an evidential base for the measure. It will help locally both those whose job it is to organise the night-time and early morning economy, and residents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_12-0_2010-02-23a.5.67" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" time="18:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100223/pm/100223s09.htm#100223109000343" colnum="453">
<p> New clause 32 and the consequential amendments will introduce a power for police officers to search the person of a controlled individual in specified circumstances, and allow them to seize articles of concern as appropriate. The clause fills a gap, which has been identified by ourselves and-dare I say it?-the courts in relation to how we deal with controlled individuals who are on control orders in the community at the moment. The important power of personal search of a controlled individual is on the face of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. We have recently had two court judgments, the latest of which was in November last year. Members may be aware that Lord Carlile, in his fifth report on control orders published on 1 February earlier this month, indicated that we need to rectify the situation and bring it into an appropriate legal framework.</p>
<p>The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 provides that the Secretary of State may impose "any obligations" on an individual, which are considered</p>
<p class="indent">"necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting involvement by that individual in terrorism-related activity".</p>
<p>The Act provides a number of obligations for the individual that the control order "may include", but does not expressly include an obligation for the individual to allow him or herself to be searched. Given that the wording of the Act makes it clear that the list of obligations that may be imposed is indicative rather than definitive, we considered that the general power was available, but sadly-or otherwise-the courts have taken a different view. In July last year, the Court of Appeal held that the 2005 Act was insufficient to authorise the imposition by a control order of an obligation to submit to a personal search.</p>
<p>In November last year, as I have already indicated, the High Court handed down a further ruling, which indicated that we could not enforce a requirement for a controlled person to submit to a personal search prior to being escorted by the police outside their boundary. Those two judgements, whatever our views of them, are causing operational difficulties on the ground. Both the Security Service and the police have assessed that our lack of ability to search a controlled individual under the 2005 Act is a loophole that causes difficulties for us. For example, individuals could have mobile phones, which are not permitted outside the controlled area, and if we cannot search the individual, would proceed with them to alternative places.</p>
<p>Most controlled individuals have geographical boundaries to restrict or disrupt their ability to engage in terrorism-related activities. The judgments make it very difficult for us to manage the risk when those individuals need to make trips outside their geographical boundaries. For those reasons, I have brought forward proposals that would allow for a search of controlled individuals, which I hope will be welcomed by the Committee. It is important, for the small number of people who have a control order, that we have the ability for the police to undertake searches. The numbers are extremely small-currently about 15 individuals. We need this power and I hope the Committee will support it.</p>

<p> The amendment and the new clause underline the practical problems with control orders and why we believe they should be reviewed-a view consistent with the security situation-to examine ways in which a suspect could be tried through the normal courts system. As the Minister has said, in essence, the provisions address points that have been brought forward as a consequence of the Court of Appeal decision in the case of GG and the High Court decision in BH. The Court of Appeal judgment found unanimously that section 1(3) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 could not be read as allowing the inclusion of a personal search obligation and control order, and that its omission from the list of example obligations in section 1(4) meant that there was no statutory basis for the power to include an obligation to submit to a personal search.</p>
<p>The Minister has alluded to the provisions in the separate High Court case concerning BH, which involved the requirement to submit to a personal search so as to enable someone subject to a control order to be escorted outside a controlled zone. I would like to understand whether that is a question of drafting. Was the court case, and the issue that the Minister seeks to address, simply a point of drafting needed to correct a legal lacuna in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, or do more underlying concerns under the European convention on human rights drive the amendment to permit the search in this way? What consideration has been given to it?</p>
<p>As the Minister said, in his report published earlier this month Lord Carlile recommended that this issue be addressed. Obviously, in the short term, we recognise that this is a case for the management of control orders, and therefore we will not object to or vote against the new clause and the amendment that the Government have tabled. However, that does not show any inconsistency in our broad approach regarding how we believe it is essential to bring people to justice before the court &nbsp;wherever possible. It is a question of getting that review done and of examining ways in which that can be achieved. The Minister has made various points about the short-term necessity of this provision, and we understand that. However, it would be helpful to know whether this is a point of drafting, or whether he seeks to address a more fundamental issue.</p>

<p> I, too, have heard the Minister's explanation. Our starting point is that we do not think that control orders are appropriate, so we would perhaps not be in the position that the Government are in.

<p> First and foremost, this is a point of drafting, which I hope helps the hon. Member for Hornchurch. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that when we search individuals on control orders, we do so in recognition of the legal responsibilities that the Court has indicated we need. We can have a wider debate in the future about the necessity of control orders. I believe that they are necessary. They are not taken lightly but they provide protection for the British public against potential terrorist activity. They are small in number, strictly controlled and have external scrutiny through Lord Carlile. I would commend them to the Committee in any debate, but today I restrict my comments to the new clauses, which are a valuable addition to help protect the British public and ensure that individuals on control orders can be searched under legal cover.</p>

<p> Along with, I suspect, most if not all other hon. Members of the House, since being elected not a week goes by without my casework-be it letters, e-mails or callers at my surgery-involving issues associated with antisocial or criminal behaviour. Frequently, such behaviour is alcohol-related and causes a huge range of problems. Such behaviour might occur in the local park down in Fenton, or in the back alleys of Fenpark. It might occur in the shopping centres in and around Longton, up on Sandford Hill or Meir Hay, across at Meir where the shops are, or in some other area such as Meir Park or Trentham. Across the constituency, time and again alcohol-related problems are arising because people are engaging in antisocial behaviour or criminal activity in the street due to drink.</p>
<p>Over the past few years I have held a number of public meetings at which I have brought together the police, the local authority and different agencies to &nbsp;tackle these issues with the community. At some of the meetings, hundreds of people have come together to address the problems arising in their area. Time and again those problems have the common theme of being alcohol-related.</p>
<p>Residents ask me at those meetings why people are allowed to sit or stand drinking outside an off-licence, perhaps down on the Meir, almost from when it opens. They open the cans, drink and act in an intimidating way, blocking the pavements where parents with pushchairs or prams are trying to get past. They do not always engage in direct antisocial behaviour or criminal activity, but they are often threatening or intimidating. Residents ask me why it seems okay for people to sit on the bandstand in our shopping area with bottles of cider all day, every day, drinking and causing a nuisance, being intimidating through their antisocial behaviour. They also ask me why it is okay at 9.30 in the morning for a couple of guys to be walking through a residential area with cans in their hands. As a can is finished, it is discarded and the next one opened. Time and again residents ask why this is permitted.</p>
<p>Where it can be shown that there is a direct link between alcohol consumption and crime or antisocial behaviour, alcohol restriction zones can be considered, but they, of course, relate to a specific place. There are tough tests to get the ARZs, and there is a perception issue. A particular community-Newstead, for example-might not want an ARZ because it does not want people to have that perception of its area. ARZs are time limited and often, a problem is solved in one area because it has moved somewhere else. When that somewhere else gets fed up with the problem and an ARZ is considered for that area, the drinkers are moved on. Where do they move to? They move back to the first area that was the problem and had the ARZ to start with. There are cost implications in constantly having to go through the process of applying for an ARZ, putting up signage and doing all the associated things.</p>
<p>Following those questions about why such things are permitted, I asked agencies, individuals and residents' associations across my constituency for their views on imposing a blanket ban across a local authority area by simply saying, "You are not allowed to drink in a public place unless it is a designated picnic area or a licensed premises within the curtilage." The unanimous view of individual residents, residents' groups and police officers was that it was a darned good idea. People should not be routinely able to sit in a busy shopping area or walk down residential streets from dawn to dusk drinking, discarding cans and causing a nuisance through intimidating behaviour, which often leads to other issues.</p>
<p>In my part of Stoke-on-Trent there are lots of back alleyways. People say they get fed up with the local idiots who have filled themselves with beer standing on the street corner on a Friday night, going past a fence or house and giving it a good kicking, throwing over bottles and worse. There are all the problems that come with that, and criminal and antisocial behaviour arises.</p>
<p>With the new clauses I am trying to do two things: prohibit the drinking of alcohol in public places and-through new clause 23-allow residents to override the normal requirements of an ARZ. It would not just be about disorder or nuisance and annoyance to members &nbsp;of the public; people in a local authority area could say, "No, we do not want this in our area." For example, in the city of Stoke-on-Trent, we do not want people to be able to walk down the street drinking alcohol, causing a nuisance, and generating the criminal and antisocial activity that goes with it, irrespective of the wishes of everyone else.</p>
<p>The clauses propose an authority-wide ban on drinking in public as a way of restoring confidence and giving people ownership over their area, so they do not have to be intimidated by groups of drinkers or constantly have to clear up the bottles, cans and associated damage that goes with people thinking it is acceptable to stand on the street corner and drink for however many hours they want. If people want to drink, great; there are plenty of pubs that we want to promote to ensure that people go back to them. It is fine if people want to drink, but they should do it at home or on licensed premises. Communities-our high streets, shopping areas and parks-are not places to drink. The clauses send out that message and would allow ordinary, hard-working, decent people to get their cities back.</p>

<p> First, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South not only for raising an important matter but for doing so in that thoughtful way, demonstrating his knowledge of the subject and his constituency. I do not feel that I need to visit it, as I know it so well after his description. [Interruption.] We can bring politics and majorities into it but, when my hon. Friend's constituents read Hansard-as I am sure they will-his majority will go up.</p>
<p>We broadly support my hon. Friend's proposals, but many of the powers he proposes are already available to local authorities and the police through designated public place orders in the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. There are 766 DPPOs in existence, and that high take-up demonstrates the popularity of the policy in its current form and the lack of too high an evidential barrier.</p>
<p>I want to point out one or two problems we have with my hon. Friend's proposals and to compare them with the current legislation on drinking in public place orders; for example, the proposed exemption for private property, or any place to which the public do not normally have access, from being part of a restricted area. I am not sure what the scope of that exemption would be, but it could prevent the police from confiscating alcohol in a supermarket car park late at night, thereby reducing their ability to tackle some cases of alcohol-related antisocial behaviour.</p>
<p>My hon. Friend raised an interesting and innovative idea about petitions. If 20 per cent. of local electors petition for the entire borough to be made a restricted public place, the local authority can create a restricted public place without first gathering evidence of the need for one. The petitions duty in the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009, will require local authorities to respond to petitions on all matters of local concern, including alcohol-related crime and disorder. The proposed statutory guidance, which will underpin that duty, will say that local authorities are expected to consider the creation of a DPPO if they are petitioned on alcohol-related crime and disorder.</p>
<p>The petitions duty is more accessible and less prescriptive than the provisions suggested in new clause 23. For example, it would require 20 per cent. of local electors &nbsp;to sign a petition to trigger a response. We estimate that in Birmingham the figure would be in the region of 150,000 signatures. The new clause would remove the current requirement to gather evidence before creating a borough-wide DPPO if the local authority received a petition from 20 per cent. of local electors, yet-we keep coming back to this issue-an evidential base is important and a crucial step in ensuring that action is both appropriate and proportionate.</p>
<p>As the amendment would replicate existing powers, and the proposed policy would, we believe, face difficulties that the existing policy avoids, I am sorry to say that I cannot accept the amendment and the new clauses and I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw them. None the less, I pay tribute to his valuable work in drawing the matter to the attention of the Committee.</p>

<p> I would like to return to a couple of points. First, on the electorate having their say, although an evidential basis is crucial, it is down to the electorate to make their views known and be listened to on some things-for example, public drinking. With respect to supermarket car parks, I suspect that it is probably not beyond the wit of most people to address the issue. However, I take on board the Minister's comments. I ask him to reconsider in the weeks ahead whether there is scope for widening the DPPO route and making it more accessible.</p>
