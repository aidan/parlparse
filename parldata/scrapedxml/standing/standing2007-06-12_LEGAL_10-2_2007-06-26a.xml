<p> The list of amendments is daunting, but they have been drafted in response to amendments tabled in the other place on behalf of the Law Society. They create new powers over sole practitioners similar to existing powers over regulated recognised bodies. They require solicitors who want to run a sole practice to apply for endorsement to do so and to be subject to specific regulatory requirements. They also ensure effective powers over sole solicitors&rsquo; employees.</p>
<p>The purpose of the amendments is to provide the Law Society with enhanced powers to regulate sole practitioners and their employees. They bring many of the Law Society&rsquo;s powers in relation to sole practitioner firms into line with its powers over partnerships and LLPs, and sole practitioner firms are often as large and as complex as recognised bodies. Overall, the amendments will ensure that all legal services practices are regulated according to the same principles. The consumers of such services will receive the same level &nbsp;of regulatory protection, regardless of whether they obtain legal services from a sole solicitor or a recognised body.</p>

<p> Schedule 16 rewrites the Solicitors Act 1974. It contains a great deal, including measures about practising certificates and the registration of holders. The issues include fees payable for practising certificates, measures about the roll or register as evidence and unqualified persons acting as solicitors. In fact, the schedule is a complete rewrite of the 1974 Act. When it comes to such large schedules, we have to take the Government at their word and give them the benefit of the doubt. We must also consult outside organisations, which is exactly what we have done.</p>
<p>The Government have responded satisfactorily to all the probing amendments tabled in the other place. Sarah Rivers of the Solicitors Regulation Authority has said:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;The SRA is broadly pleased with the substantial number of amendments that have been made to modernise our regulatory powers throughout the course of the Legal Services Bill&rsquo;s passage in Parliament. We are especially grateful to the Conservative Front Bench, in tabling these technical amendments, for their help to achieve this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SRA is particularly grateful to Lord Kingsland and Lord Hunt. There is only one outstanding issue. I am grateful that the Government have listened, because these are very technical and complicated amendments. As I have mentioned, we are effectively rewriting an earlier piece of legislation&mdash;I would not recommend doing that on a regular basis. We could almost have had a completely new solicitors Bill, but the Government decided to do it a different way by virtue of this schedule.</p>
<p>Amendment No. 307 seeks to provide for a longer period in which a solicitor can be suspended pending referral to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. The Government have made it clear that there are problems with the amendment. It is the only amendment that we have tabled that the Government have not been able to act on positively. Will the Minister tell us why that is?</p>
<p>This is really a congratulatory effort on my part. I would like to thank the Minister for listening to organisations such as the Law Society, the SRA and other bodies, which have had a constructive and imaginative input into the debate. As a consequence, we have a better and more effective schedule.</p>
<p>Having said that I was only going to talk for four minutes, I have now spoken for three minutes and 45 seconds. I will sit down, but once again, I want to thank the Minister and her team for listening very carefully and responding in a positive and helpful way&mdash;I wish that Ministers would do that the whole time. Fortunately, they do it from time to time, and when they do, we must congratulate and thank them.</p>

<p> I would like to reassure the hon. Gentleman about amendment No. 307. We felt that it was not appropriate to extend the suspension from 12 to 18 months. Obviously, the SRA needs to be equipped to protect consumers from solicitors who have been convicted of fraud or serious crime. The amendment, however, might have had the undesirable effect of reducing incentives for the Law Society and the tribunal to deal with disciplinary cases swiftly. The SRA accepts that our concerns about long delays are important, and it has asked that the amendment is not pressed.</p>

<p> As the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has said, this group and later groups of amendments concern the substantive law that governs the professions. The Law Society has promoted some of the changes, which the Minister picked up on. Have other people who might have an interest been consulted? We must be satisfied that there is broader confirmation that the Government are going in the right direction and that there are not any objections. I have understood the main objections, but I do not pretend to have my head round every single implication of all the changes to all the other Acts.</p>
<p>The Department has consulted people other than just the Law Society; it is satisfied this group of amendments and the other groups contain nothing that will cause anybody difficulty; and the amendments are all improvements to put the relevant houses in good order.</p>

<p> Again, I hope to speak briefly to the amendments, which are technical. They would provide the scope of the Law Society&rsquo;s powers, so that they were properly applied to the correct persons. The power to rebuke and to fine is an important one, and the approved regulators must be able to take appropriate action against those whom they regulate. The powers in the amendments would allow the society to act quickly and effectively when its rules are breached and when there is a finding of professional misconduct against a solicitor.</p>
<p class="indent">The intention is that more minor rule breaches and professional misconduct would be dealt with by the Law Society, while the solicitors disciplinary tribunal would determine the more serious cases. The SDT would have an unlimited power to fine, but the maximum penalty for the Law Society would be &#163;2,000.</p>

<p> I shall speak to them separately, as they are quite different.</p>
<p>Amendment (a) would make a technical change to Government amendment No. 78. It would change the obligation to publish from one that would need a positive step to be taken to an obligation to consider that it would not be in the public interest to publish. It is a subtle but important change and would result in an automatic presumption that things would be put in the public domain rather than it having to be proven in each case. It would assist good working to ensure that, unless there was good reason not to do so, everything would be put in the public domain. I am sure that the Minister will be fully convinced by the logic of my argument.</p>
<p>Amendment (b) would allow the variation by a tribunal of decisions of the Law Society. That is important, because if the tribunal has to decide yea or nay&mdash;all or nothing&mdash;there would be more danger of a clever solicitor making a defence that was partially convincing. There would thus be more likelihood of the tribunal saying no, even on a technicality, because it would have no option. In such instances, the tribunal ought to be able to make a halfway determination. It strikes me that the balance would otherwise always be with the clever or technical argument, which could dominate tribunal decisions, whereas allowing a variation would mean that the tribunal could determine whatever it chose, based on all the facts.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-06-12_LEGAL_10-2_2007-06-26a.2.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" speakername="Bridget Prentice" time="20:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/legal/070626/pm/partii/70626s01.htm#07062765000117" colnum="448">
<p> I imagine that we agree that there ought to be transparency in the Law Society&rsquo;s decision making process. In many circumstances, it will clearly be in the public interest to publish once a fine or rebuke has been issued. However, I am not sure that it should be the default position for disciplinary action of that type to be published automatically. As it happens, I am not convinced that amendment (a) would achieve automatic publication unless it was not in the public interest, because it states that the Law Society &ldquo;may&rdquo; publish.</p>
<p>Given the intention behind my hon. Friend&rsquo;s amendment, I shall explain our view. We believe that due consideration should be given in each case. However, it is more appropriate and probably more proportionate to take action as set out in Government amendments Nos. 78 and 94, in which it is anticipated that the Law Society would at the time of the determination consider whether or not it was in the public interest to publish. That leads to the idea that it may not necessarily be appropriate to publish determinations.</p>
<p>My hon. Friend&rsquo;s other amendment would allow the tribunal to</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;vary the decision of the Society&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I entirely agree with that position, but Government amendments Nos. 78 and 94 already provide the tribunal with a large number of powers, which can be exercised on appeal. They amount to the ability to vary or replace every aspect of a decision that has been appealed. That includes the power to vary the penalty and to make such an order as it sees fit. That gives the tribunal the scope to</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;vary the decision of the society&rdquo;</p>
<p>that my hon. Friend seeks.</p>
<p>Government amendment No. 94 also contains a range of powers that is sufficient to consider an appeal, including the power to vary the amount of the penalty. I hope that those amendments, which give the tribunal wide scope, cover the proper concerns that my hon. Friend raised. I therefore ask him not to press his amendments to a vote.</p>

<p> The amendments ensure that the provisions in the Bill and in five other statutory provisions are consistent with the common law on legal professional privilege. The Bill already provides that the clients of ABS firms should have the same degree of LPP protection as the clients of any other type of legal service provider. That was set out in what used to be subsections (3) to (7) of clause 182.</p>
<p> However, both the Bar Council and the Law Society raised the possibility that certain terms in that provision might not reflect fully the current state of the common law of LPP. The wording reflected similar wording used in other statutory provisions that ensure LPP protection for clients of certain legal services providers, such as recognised bodies and licensed conveyancers. We have looked carefully at that and have decided to modify what is now clause 191, as well as the other relevant provisions.</p>
<p>The amendments essentially do two things. First, they remove the reference to legal proceedings in the relevant provisions, because the law provides clients with LPP protection in certain circumstances outside of legal proceedings. Secondly, they expand the reference to communication, because again the law provides clients with LPP protection in certain circumstances, regarding not only communications but documents, material or other information.</p>
<p>Therefore the amendments ensure LPP protection for the clients of ABS firms, so that firms do not operate at a competitive disadvantage compared with other types of provider. They essentially modify five earlier provisions about LPP. Those provisions ensure protection for the clients of other legal service providers, licensed conveyancers, bodies recognised by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers, bodies recognised by the Law Society, patent attorneys, trade mark attorneys and certain authorised practitioners under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990.</p>
<p>Together the amendments ensure that clients of all of those providers have the LPP protection equivalent to the clients of solicitors. That means that both types of clients are equally protected, no matter where they go for legal services, and no type of provider will get a competitive advantage over other providers as a result. </p>
<p>The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey asked about consultation. We have consulted not only the legal professions but the consumer organisations, too. I express particular thanks to both the Bar Council and the Law Society. I suspect that most people would say that that would be an unusual thing for me to do, but in this instance they have been extremely helpful. The Bar Council even went so far as to provide opinion from a legal expert on the subject, which was shared with us, and that opinion informed our reconsideration of the amendments. The Law Society has also provided valuable input. It is a good example of how a co-operative approach can achieve the desired result, for which I am grateful to them all.</p>

<p> Thank you, as always, Sir Nicholas, for conducting what is not the most easy stage of our proceedings in such an extremely professional manner.</p>
<p> Everyone will be reassured by what the Minister said in response to my general point about the amendments. People will be reassured that the Minister has the confidence of both key professional bodies and others who were consulted, who all signed up and came to an agreement. Changing the small print can sometimes conceal a multitude of unexpected consequences, but if all those brains and interests have come together to say that the proposal is wonderful, who are we to presume otherwise?</p>

<p> These amendments are even more straightforward than the previous ones. They replace references in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 to &ldquo;officers&rdquo; of recognised bodies with &ldquo;managers&rdquo; of recognised bodies, ensuring consistency with previous amendments to the Administration of Justice Act 1985. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey will be pleased that at least the terminology used in relation to Law Society regulated practices is consistent in those two Acts.</p>

<p> The Minister kindly said earlier that she would consider the issue of people not giving information about their professional qualifications at first introduction. The clause will make it an offence for an unqualified person to pretend to be a barrister. Am I right in assuming that that implies that it is not an offence at the moment? I think that everybody assumes that it is.</p>
<p>My understanding is that it is an anomaly that we have never legislated to make it an offence for somebody to present themselves as a barrister. We have such legislation for solicitors, doctors and other professions, so the clause is a welcome addition. This is one of those rare occasions when creating a new offence is a good idea. There are many Government new offences that some of us find OTT, but this might be a useful little addition to the legislation.</p>

<p> The answer is yes, it is an offence. The clause will bring the offence provision into parity with offences under section 21 of the Solicitors Act 1974. The Bar Council has asked the Government to include the clause to uphold the significance of the Inns of Court, which provide education and training for barristers. That is why the clause is needed.</p>

<p> The clause refers to the Compensation Act 2006, with which the Minister was heavily involved. She made commitments that the Bill would take up matters legislated for in the 2006 Act.

<p> I hope that I can help. The idea behind the clause is that the integration of the 2006 Act and the Bill can be achieved only once the LSB and the OLC are fully established. If it is too early to make a decision about the claims management regulation system, that is because that system is itself only a few months old. Although it is working incredibly efficiently, we should give the regime time to bed in and assess its impact when we know how best to deliver that integration with the minimum disruption to the protection that consumers enjoy under the 2006 Act. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s question.</p>

<p> This clause gives rights of audience to employees of housing management bodies. Like the Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley, and others, I represent large numbers of council tenants and the tenants of housing associations and trusts. As we know, housing officers go to the county court on a regular basis to act as if they were a lawyer on behalf of the landlord, to deal with rent arrears, breaches of tenancy, possession actions and other matters.</p>
<p>I have spotted something in the clause that I had assumed was covered, but it is not abundantly clear, as there are lots of different arrangements between housing authorities and other housing providers. There are arm&rsquo;s length management organisations and other such part-tenant management co-operatives, estate management boards, tenant management boards and others, and the council may have an arrangement with a housing association or housing trust that uses the premises on a short-term basis for homeless people or in cases of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Will the definition in new section 60A(7) of the County Courts Act 1984 cover all those bodies? It does not look as if it will, if one considers the definition of a housing management body. However, I am happy that the Minister has agreed to consider that technical matter, which could be clarified on Report. I am conscious that there has been a huge expansion in those sorts of bodies, and I guess that the proposal is intended to give authority for those issues to be taken up in the county court.</p>
<p>People should know what authority a person has when they go to court. I have had cases in which people are not sure how far down a management tree the responsibility rests, which has led to some fairly junior people, who did not appear to have the authority to deal with those matters, pitching up at county courts. If there is to be fair but effective disposal of matters in &nbsp;county courts, they should not be dealt with by someone who, to put it bluntly, does not have any more authority than doing what they were told when they left the office. I am keen that we should not go so far down the management tree that we are authorising people who do not understand how the county courts and the profession work. There is a practical concern in dealing with all the cases. I would be grateful for a response on whether we should authorise such junior people and whether all eventualities are covered.</p>

<p> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. The rights that are outlined in this clause will be exercisable only by those employees of housing management bodies that have an agreement with the local housing authority under section 27 of the Housing Act 1985. They might be former employees of the local authority or housing officers who lost their rights under the local authority when they were transferred over. We have worked with the Department for Communities and Local Government on this, and it has confirmed that the measure covers the huge variety of people mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, but I will double-check to be sure.</p>
<p>Section 27 agreements have to be approved by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government before they can take effect. I hope that the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s second concern, which I share, will fall into that category. Through that system, we will ensure that the person who appears in court is appropriate and has the approval of the Secretary of State through section 27.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 243, in clause 194, page 106, line 41, leave out subsection (2).</p>
<p>Colleagues will no doubt be glad to know that this is our last amendment. However, it is a slightly heavy and serious point that does not have the levity of some of the other issues. The clause as it stands means that solicitors who are employed in the Government service are not required to comply with the same regulatory system as other solicitors. In the interests of fairness and equity, I want to put the case made by the Law Society, which is that that exemption is no longer justified. The amendment would take away the exemption that allows solicitors in the Government service to operate without a practising certificate, which is a strange anomaly.</p>
<p>It is a core principle that all those who are subject to regulation should contribute to the cost of regulation. Ministers have said that before. In response to the Joint Committee, the Government said that the basic &nbsp;principle is that those being regulated should bear the cost. As far as the cost of regulating solicitors is concerned, the present position is that all solicitors providing legal services in private practice in England and Wales are required to hold and pay for a practising certificate and thus contribute towards the cost. Solicitors also have to qualify to get that certificate.</p>
<p>Solicitors in commerce and in industry and in local government are required to have practising certificates if they undertake reserved activities, or if they are held out as solicitors. For example, if Southwark council&rsquo;s legal department sent someone to negotiate a contract with a private developer as a solicitor, they would require a practising certificate. Government solicitors, however, are wholly exempt from the need to hold a practising certificate in England and Wales, even if they do the same job as local government solicitors. Scottish solicitors must comply with the same rules as those in private practice or local government. The anomaly applies to England and Wales and dates from the 19th century.</p>
<p>It is unclear why the exemption was originally provided. No logical and persuasive reason has been given, either in the other place or earlier, why the exemption should continue to exist. Given that we are performing a portmanteau tidying-up of the professions&mdash;we have just agreed to a schedule dealing with such things&mdash;and putting the legal services into a new structure, it seems entirely anomalous that one little reserved, rather self-interested pocket of people in Government will be protected from the same modernisation and streamlining affecting everyone else.</p>

<p> I support the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s view. Does he share my concern that it is important for the Government to take an appropriate lead in tidying up old anomalies? Is he aware of the rebuttal that the Government may well give&mdash;that Government lawyers do not hold client money? There is a way to deal with that&mdash;by having an amount proportionate to the amount for a practising certificate. It could be less, as in other sectors, rather than being completely thrown away on principle.</p>

<p> I am grateful. As the Committee knows, the hon. Gentleman is a solicitor. That is the only argument that has been advanced&mdash;that Government lawyers do not take client money as private practice solicitors do. He is absolutely right. Nobody is saying that there should be one flat fee for every solicitor doing every job in England and Wales. There is absolutely an argument for a differential charge.</p>

<p> Yes. There is a sliding scale, and Government solicitors could be incorporated within it. I understand that the Government have already recognised implicitly in other contexts the indefensibility of the present exemption. When the CPS was created in the 1980s, prosecuting solicitors who had worked in local government and held a practising certificate there transferred to the CPS, a central Department. The Government recognised that it was unjustifiable that that change of &nbsp;employer should mean that those solicitors did not have to hold practising certificates, so the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 specifically required CPS solicitors to hold a practising certificate. That remains unaltered today.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the Bar Council&rsquo;s practising certificate fees came into force as a result of the Access to Justice Act 1999, no provision was made to exclude Government barristers from the need to hold a practising certificate. Both recent changes have integrated practitioners working in the Government service, so there is a discriminatory anomaly relating to solicitors in the general Government service, who are clearly benefiting from something unjustifiable that involves other anomalies, too. Barristers who work for the Government must pay; solicitors who work for Government need not.</p>
<p>It could be regarded as justifiable, I suppose, if the Government claimed&mdash;they would have a mini-riot on their hands if they did&mdash;that the solicitors who work for them are second-class solicitors. However, those people are not employed as second-class solicitors. They are employed as solicitors, and if one speaks to them or inquires who is in the Department, one is told that they are Government solicitors&mdash;solicitors for the Department. They are subject to the same professional discipline as others and to the same rules in other respects.</p>
<p>The Minister will know that the matter arose in the House of Lords. She replied to the point made by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate by saying, &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t hold client money; therefore, there isn&rsquo;t a regulatory risk.&rdquo; However, we are not arguing about the risk factor. We are arguing about the fairness factor and the need for equal treatment of everybody who contributes to the great new edifice of this regulatory regime. The issue is about ensuring that people pay in to fund the process of qualifying to be a solicitor and continue their professional education, which all solicitors are expected to do to advance their careers. It is also about ensuring that the people who administer and enforce the rules of conduct are paid fairly and covering the cost of monitoring and enforcing compliance with the rules of conduct, which is a service that all other solicitors pay for. Government solicitors are governed by those rules, so they are getting the service and paying nothing, which cannot be right.</p>
<p>Government solicitors have regularly to advise on the lawfulness of particular actions, when they want to achieve the objectives of their political masters, which is entirely understandable. To all those to whom I have spoken, to the Law Society and to me, it seems important that those solicitors are subject to the same professional duties&mdash;including duties to the court, because they could appear in court&mdash;to help to ensure that they give independent legal advice, rather than just the advice that their bosses wish them to give. That is to say that the courts would expect a Government solicitor to be just as honest as any other solicitor when it comes to matters such as duties to the court or conflicts of interest. The courts would not give them any special dispensation because they are in the Government service.</p>
<p>In the other place, the Attorney-General argued that there would be no public benefit from removing the exemption for Government solicitors and that it would only put up the Government&rsquo;s costs. If Government solicitors are effectively regulated, as they should be, and are subject to the same professional responsibilities as their colleagues in private practice and in commerce and industry, the fact that the Government provide proper training does not negate the point that the basis of employment should be the same. Most firms provide in-house training for their solicitors during their employment. The blunt truth is that the Government are getting solicitors on the cheap, or solicitors in Government service are getting their opportunity to be solicitors on the cheap ahead of everybody else, which cannot be good or fair. The rest of the profession thinks that some protectionism is going on, which is not good. Let us bear in mind also that people from other walks of life come in to and go out of Government service.</p>
<p>I shall now address the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s second point. The Law Society has said to the Government that it is inappropriate for the same practising fees to be applied to all sectors, given that there are significant differences between the ways in which different sectors regard the use of regulatory resources. In the case of Government lawyers, the cost of practising certificate fees arguably should be less, for the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman. There are certain activities in which there is no risk at all, but that does not mean that they should be wholly exempt.</p>
<p>The present law does not allow the Law Society to charge differential fees, so the Law Society cannot charge Government lawyers less. The amendments to the Solicitors Act 1974 that we have been discussing would give the Law Society that power. The requirement to hold a practising certificate would not lead to an unfair burden being put on Government lawyers of the future or on Departments, which in practice pay for that certificate. That would mean that there would be no anomalous, unfair exemption.</p>
<p>I am sorry that this is a heavy point for the last evening of the Blair Government, but it is important, because there is a sense of injustice. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s support and hope that I can bring other members of the Committee with me. I also hope that the Minister understands that this is not a matter that I, or others, feel can be left to lie. This is the Bill in which we need to correct this problem.</p>

<p> As the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said, this is the last evening of the fantastically wonderful Blair Government.</p>
<p>I was a wee bit surprised when the amendment turned up here, because the matter was debated at some &nbsp;length in the other place and even went to a vote, which the Government won. I am sure that much of the reason for that was the fact that the arguments were put so cogently by my noble Friend the Attorney-General. Not only did he put forward the arguments on this provision, but those in the other place were persuaded by them.</p>
<p>As we are being pleasant and friendly on the last evening of the fantastic Blair Government&mdash;<span class="italic">[</span><span class="italic">Interruption.</span><span class="italic">]</span> Perhaps I am being too friendly; I must stop. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey put his case exceptionally well and cogently. However, I wish to explain why the Government won the argument in the other place. As my noble Friend the Attorney-General said, unlike lawyers operating outside, the Government solicitors do not provide services direct to the public, because the Government are their clients.</p>
<p class="indent">Government solicitors must have many of the attributes of other solicitors, such as a law degree, completing the academic stage of professional training, being enrolled by the Law Society and so on. They are also bound by the civil service code, which ensures that appointments are made on merit on the basis of a fair and open competition, and that roles are carried out with integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality. They are also subject to the employment conditions applicable to their individual Departments.</p>

<p> The fact that the Government&rsquo;s solicitors do not provide services to the general public could apply to solicitors in the not-for-profit sector. They are regulated and have to pay a fee, so why should those in the civil service be in a privileged position? It does not make sense. Surely the employment regulations do not have anything to do with regulation as members of a profession.</p>

<p> Nevertheless, the argument is that the solicitors do not deal directly with the public. They are subject to the employment conditions applicable to their individual Departments. I am not aware of evidence of any serious failure in the Government&rsquo;s legal services, although no doubt some hon. Members could think of some. The head of that service is diligent in performing his duty to ensure that a strong and proportionate system of regulation is in place to ensure that high standards are met at all times.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier the annual turnover of some &#163;20-plus billion in the legal sector. I know that, despite what some newspapers would have us believe, not every lawyer is a fat cat, but many of them are fairly comfortable cats&mdash;I do not see many signs of poverty in Chancery lane&mdash;so I do not see the justification for paying something in the region of &#163;850,000 of public money to the Law Society to cover a charge for issuing practising certificates.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman made a cogent argument, but I must resist the amendment. As my noble Friend the Attorney-General was so clearly able to persuade his colleagues in the other place, I hope that I shall similarly persuade him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

They either meet the cost of the things that are needed for an employee, as an employer normally does, or they say, &ldquo;You can only be employed if you have a practising certificate.&rdquo; That could, therefore, not put the burden on the taxpayer but be like saying, &ldquo;We will employ you, put in the adverts, have a word with the Government, but you have to come with a practising certificate.&rdquo; Many people do their jobs and pay their annual fee to remain qualified&mdash;whether that is tax deductible is a different matter.</p>
<p>I think that the Minister knows that there is an anomaly and I think that the very estimable Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General&mdash;for the time being&mdash;knows that, too. He will not have to defend that anomaly after tomorrow, but the Minster will&mdash;<span class="italic">[</span><span class="italic">Laughter.</span><span class="italic">]</span> Well, I hope that she will. The Attorney-General has said that he is going and the Minister has not said that she is. If we report faithfully what she has said tonight and feed it into the system, no doubt that will boost her chances of promotion, which my hon. Friend and I both want her to benefit from.</p>
<p>I am afraid that I do not accept the argument and will, just to make sure that we never lose the opportunity to practise, press the amendment to a vote.</p>

<p>Payments in respect of pro bono representation</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 323, in clause 195, page 108, line 11, leave out &lsquo;under section 3&rsquo; and insert &lsquo;in accordance with section 3A&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The clause allows the court to make an order for costs in cases where the successful party has been &nbsp;represented pro bono. Although the work might have been done free of charge, the court could order a sum to be paid in respect of that work to a registered charity prescribed by the Lord Chancellor, and that charity will then be able to administer and distribute those funds to provide legal advice and help where it is needed most.</p>
<p>The clause applies in civil proceedings where the party in whose favour the cost order is given was represented on a pro bono basis by a lawyer, and will overcome an anomaly in cost law by allowing such cases to be treated in a similar way to normal fee-paying cases. The result will be a more level playing field in which both parties to the litigation are potentially liable for costs. I hope that that might encourage the earlier settlement of cases that are currently being pursued through the courts, as the opponent of a party who is represented pro bono will know from the outset that, if he loses, he may still have to pay something for the other parties&rsquo; representations in addition to his own costs.</p>
<p>Since the clause was first drafted we have made changes regarding registration in the Charities Act 1993, and to reflect that, the amendment is a technical one. I shall now look at the clause in more detail. Subsections (5) and (6) will prevent an order from being made against a person who is funded entirely by civil legal aid or is represented pro bono. It was felt that to expose those groups of people to one of these orders might put undue pressure on the civil legal aid fund or discourage people from offering pro bono assistance. Subsection (7) allows the rules of court to be made about making those orders. It is envisaged that those rules will be set out alongside the procedural matters&mdash;the factors that the court should have regard to, in addition to those in subsection (4).</p>
<p>Under subsections (3), (8) and (9) the sums generated by the cost orders will be directed to the charity prescribed by the Lord Chancellor, which will be registered in accordance with the Charities Act 1993. The charity will administer the payments that it receives for the benefit of the pro bono community generally, and recognised pro bono organisations and projects in particular. There is a small technical change that it is appropriate to look at. Under the 1993 Act, registration is in section 3; once that Act is amended by the Charities Act 2006, it will appear under section 3A. The amendment to subsection (9)(a) reflects that change, which I hope will be acceptable.</p>
<p>When the prescribed charity was discussed in the other place, amendments were tabled. The first of those would have allowed those undertaking pro bono work to nominate any charity to receive individual awards, and the second would have obliged the prescribed charity to consider the lawyer&rsquo;s wishes in distributing awards. The Attorney-General, whose national pro bono co-ordinating committee has been a driver behind the current proposal, resisted those amendments. He explained that the fact that the prescribed charity would be a national body, able to effect strategic distribution of funds to the whole pro bono community, was one of its most valuable assets. It would be regrettable to bind the charity to a statutory obligation to take a particular lawyer&rsquo;s expression of &nbsp;preference into account, when none of the other factors that may be considered in distributing the moneys would be expressed in the Bill.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General offered the reassurance that one of the factors that the prescribed charity would have regard to when making decisions&mdash;probably through guiding principles rather than as a constitutional fetter&mdash;would be any preference expressed by the legal representatives acting in a particular case. However, those preferences would not be determinative. If there was much of an advantage to the strategic perspective offered by the national charity, that would be lost. On that basis, the amendments were withdrawn.</p>
<p>On 16 April, we issued a consultation paper setting out our proposals for secondary legislation provided for by the clause, including any possible changes to procedural rules needed to help the courts deliver the provision. It has been made widely available to, among others, those who will benefit from the legislation, and to Members of this House, so that they have an opportunity to comment if they so wish.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister for her explanation. She is right to tell the Committee that the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) wrote to the Conservative Front Benchers, and I would imagine to the Liberal Democrat Front Benchers also, to explain what the Government are going to do. We are content with the amendment.</p>

<p> I have one question for the Minister, and I will be happy if she gives the answer in writing at the earliest practical date. The clause sets out the offences that can be committed by corporate bodies and unincorporated bodies. I always like to do an offence-watch exercise on each piece of legislation, and I wonder whether we can be told, possibly by letter, how many new offences will be created as a result of the, and how many current offences will be repealed. That will enable us to see the balance of criminality that we are left with as a result of the Bill.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in clause 212, page 120, line 5, leave out from &lsquo;Chancellor&rsquo; to end of line 24.</p>
<p>This amendment reverses one that was made in the other place. The Lords amendment imposed two conditions on the commencement of part 5 of the Bill, which deals with ABS. The first condition was that more research needed to be conducted into the possible effects of ABS and then the results of that research would have to be considered by Parliament before part 5 could be commenced. The second condition was that, unlike the rest of the Bill, part 5 could only be commenced with the approval of both Houses under the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>
<p> Frankly, I cannot see that further research would add anything constructive to the Bill. Baroness Ashton took pains to explain in the other place that such research could achieve only two things: either it would compare our reforms with other jurisdictions, in which case we would learn very little that is relevant, or it would try to estimate the effects of the ABS in the absence of any firms actually being operational, in which case we would get a lot of theory but there would be little chance of &nbsp;discovering anything based on hard evidence. Neither type of information would be much help to Parliament in approving a commencement order.</p>
<p>We have already commissioned research and used it to inform the Bill. Between the Clementi report and our White Paper, well-respected academics examined the benefits of multi-ownership models and law services&rsquo; multi-disciplinary practices, as well as the organisational structure of legal firms. They all concluded that the ABS proposals were sensible and did not present unacceptable risks.</p>
<p>If we do not deal with clause 212, there is also a risk of delay. It will be some time before part 5 is commenced, which will happen in 2010 or 2011. It may seem as if there is plenty of time to do research, but, of course, there could be other developments before then. Consequently, we would risk the results of such research becoming even less relevant. To defer the commencement of part 5 to take account of the most up-to-date developments would mean risking part 5 not being ready in time or having little relevance.</p>
<p> We do not want to delay the benefits that part 5 offers consumers. I believe that the timetable is sensible. It ensures that the board will begin approving licensing authorities only when it and the authorities are ready, which will necessarily take some time. There is no justification for delay beyond that time, other than the reasonable caution that I would expect licensing authorities to exercise when they start their work. There is even less justification for imposing a requirement to carry out further research when there is little point behind the research and little chance of producing anything useful beyond what we already know.</p>
<p> The other troublesome element in clause 212 is the requirement for an affirmative resolution for any commencement order, which is a kind of sunrise clause. I do not agree that that measure is necessary, and it was not proposed by the Delegated Powers Committee. Commencement orders are not normally subject to parliamentary procedure, particularly affirmative procedure, and I see no reason to change things here. If anything, this requirement for affirmative procedure is a crude, clumsy attempt to put obstacles in the way of part 5 and specifically to give a veto to those in the House of Lords who oppose the concept of ABS, but whose arguments have failed to win the debate on the principle. Taken with the requirement for more research, hon. Members could be forgiven for thinking that this was a wrecking amendment, or a wrecking clause.</p>
<p>Bearing all that in mind, I urge the Committee to support my amendment to remove that clause from the Bill.</p>

<p> I have listened to what the Minister has said and I can tell her that, although we are not particularly happy with the Government amendment, which will overturn what was inserted in the House of Lords, we will not vote against it, as she has made some good points. We are very disappointed indeed that the Government have decided to overturn a number of other Lords amendments, but we have had those debates already. I think that the Government have been curmudgeonly and ungenerous, but on this occasion the debate has rolled on and some greater understanding and realisation have been achieved. That particular &nbsp;Lords amendment was not completely spot on, which it should have been, so we will not force a vote.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-06-12_LEGAL_10-2_2007-06-26a.12.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" time="21:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/legal/070626/pm/partii/70626s03.htm#07062765000331" colnum="471">
<p> This is the last controversial amendment. I am willing to do the Government a deal, but I do not think that the Minister will buy it: the terms are that she withdraws the amendment and we give her no trouble on the remaining two Government amendments to be debated before our consideration of the Bill is completed. I merely give her a chance to reflect, but it does not look like she is likely to buy it.</p>
<p>The second thing to say before dealing with the substance of the matter is that there are two pressures on those of us who are considering what to do on this amendment: pressure from the Minister and her desire to move on to introduce alternative business structures, and pressure from my colleagues and independents in the other place, who voted to secure a majority of 68 for the amendment, which she is seeking to undo. I would rather face the wrath of the Minister on a temporary basis than that of all 78 colleagues, which is how many there were before the Government started making overtures to them earlier in the week.</p>
<p> On the substance of my main point, like the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, I reflected seriously on the matter. I did not say, &ldquo;We must absolutely hold the line just because that was the view that my colleagues took in the other place.&rdquo; I reflected on whether we should change our position. On balance, I decided that we should not do so, that we should support the Bill as it is and that we should oppose the Government amendment. There are three reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, there is still huge concern among many interested people about the introduction of ABS, and an independent report at this stage&mdash;after all the debate on the Bill&mdash;would produce a new ability to assess the benefits and disbenefits. Yes, such a report might draw on other jurisdictions and other assessments, and it would not be based on practice, but given that there is nothing else that one can use for assessment, one has to use the best evidence available, which would be up to date.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must address the access to justice concerns, which we have already discussed. Thirdly, there must be the ability to have a sunrise clause. As the Minister knows, other Bills have included sunrise clauses. A sunrise clause would mean that there would have to be parliamentary agreement to press the button on the new business structures, which is, on balance, the right side of the line.</p>
<p>The debate has moved on, as the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has said, but I am still persuaded that there are sufficient concerns for us to believe that the House of Lords was right on this issue, that we need to proceed with caution, and that that reflects the view reached by the Joint Committee and during earlier consideration. The Government are pushing too hard and too fast in that direction.</p>
<p>In any event, if the Government&rsquo;s proposals are winning arguments and can win people around to their way of thought, they will also win the vote. I hope, for the time being, that colleagues will accept that it is better to proceed carefully and cautiously, and that this &nbsp;is such an approach to what could be a harmful, as well as potentially beneficial, option.</p>

<p> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he has put his concerns. Sir David Clementi was on a number of occasions, not least quite recently in a meeting organised by the Bar Council, very supportive of our ABS proposals, in which I believe absolutely. I do not think that ABS will happen overnight anyway, which is why I do not think that the amendment needs to stand, even if I agreed with it in the first place. It is much more likely that local development plans will be up and running before multidisciplinary practices come into being. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are looking at one aspect of that to see whether other areas can be accommodated.</p>
<p> I believe that the motive in the other place was to scupper this part of the Bill. Despite what hon. Members have said, nothing that I have heard has dissuaded me from that view. I believe that a cautious approach will be taken when the board, the regulators and the licensing authorities begin, and that the world will not turn into an ABS overnight. It is still a little way off, so we have time to ensure that we get the right rules and regulations in place for the licensing authorities to do their work properly. The Consumer Panel is of the view that the Lords amendment was a wrecking amendment, and all consumer groups are keen to for us to go ahead with the Bill as originally drafted.</p>

<p> A range of views was expressed in the other place, as elsewhere. Some people are implacably opposed to part 5 of the Bill and have heard nothing to change their minds, but others take a more cautious and incremental view. I share the Minister&rsquo;s opinion that some hold that view, but I thought it better to hold on to my position because it accommodates a broader range of opinion than proceeding in the way suggested by the Minister.</p>

<p> I understand what the hon. Gentleman says, but it is important that we move on. We are trying in part 5 to give the opportunity for ABS to happen within the framework that I have described. Certainly, there will be caution at the beginning in order to ensure that everyone is satisfied and that the new system works properly. Those not motivated by principled objections who want to ensure that we get it right should be reassured that everything else that builds into part 5 will ensure that a proper approach is taken.</p>

<p> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. It is a pleasure to make the final statement in Committee. I shall shortly be thanking the huge variety of people who have so greatly contributed in bringing the Bill to Committee and in improving it in the course of the Committee debates.</p>
<p>First, however, let me state my belief that, when the Bill receives Royal Assent&mdash;as I am sure that it will&mdash;it will be among the most significant statutes produced by any Government in improving legislation for consumers. I do not say that lightly&mdash;I am convinced that it is the case&mdash;and I am particularly pleased and proud to have been involved in making it happen. No matter what happens later this week, I know that through the passage of the Bill I have at least played a part in making consumers&rsquo; lives a great deal better.</p>
<p> I thank the Bill team, which, not surprisingly&mdash;given that the Bill has 215 clauses and 24 schedules&mdash;is quite large. They have been magnificent in providing advice and amendments, and in giving advice and support to the Opposition, when they have asked for it, in clarifying issues. I am grateful to Nigel Reeder and his team for the work that they have done. I am also grateful to the Clerks to the Committee, who have been extremely helpful, always courteous and always ready to offer excellent advice. The new system of explanatory &nbsp;memorandums at the end of amendments has been a marvellous improvement, for which we have been the pilot, and I hope that it will be adopted elsewhere.</p>
<p>I thank colleagues on both sides of the House for their courteous, humorous and always gracious conduct in the debate. I am particularly grateful for the contributions of my hon. Friends. I feel as if I now know virtually everybody who lives in Bassetlaw, and I certainly think that people in North Durham visit their solicitors far too often. Nevertheless, those contributions were important and focused us on some critical issues. I am grateful also to the Opposition for the way in which they have conducted themselves.</p>
<p> I thank my Parliamentary Private Secretary, and those who have at intervals acted as PPS, for making sure that I have all the relevant information, and my hon. Friend the Whip for glaring at us when we went on too long. I thank all the organisations that have been involved on both sides&mdash;the consumer side and the legal profession. Particular thanks also go to you, Sir Nicholas, and to your colleague, Frank Cook, for your wonderful supervision of our proceedings and for the charming way in which you have kept us in line. That has ensured that the Bill is better than when we began.</p>

<p> Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas. There is not time to go into detail but, on behalf of the official Opposition, I endorse everything that the Minister has said.</p>

<p> Likewise, I offer my thanks to you, Sir Nicholas, to Mr. Cook and to the Clerks who have done a sterling job. Above all, I pay tribute to the Minister who has single-handedly led for the Government in Committee and who deserves our thanks. The Committee has been happy and successful.</p>

<p> I congratulate the whole Committee. From my point of view, it has been a very agreeable and constructive Committee. I congratulate the Front-Bench spokesmen, and I particularly congratulate the Minister on handling a Bill entirely on her own, although no doubt with good back-up from the civil service. I thank my Clerk, the Doorkeepers, the police and the Hansard writers. If every Committee ran as smoothly, this place would perhaps run more smoothly as a whole. Thank you all for your complimentary remarks, and I shall pass on your thanks to Mr. Cook.</p>
