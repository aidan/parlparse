<p> I welcome our witnesses to this afternoon&#146;s sitting. I welcome in particular Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Police Officers and Gary Pugh, director of forensic services in the Metropolitan Police Service, on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>
<p>Sir Hugh, you and Gary Pugh will have studied the Bill. If in two minutes you could give us your introductory views, that would be helpful. I was going to ask you to introduce yourselves, but as there are just two of you and I have mentioned your names and everybody knows you and, I suspect, Mr. Pugh too, that would be a waste of time. Could you, Sir Hugh, give us your general run-down of the Bill?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I bring apologies from my colleague Chris Sims, who is a real expert on DNA at the ACPO level. Gary, of course, has done a huge amount of detailed work. I will leave him to do the detail and I will just give a broad overview of what I see to be the key issues around this Bill, mindful of the European Court judgment. From an ACPO perspective, we are very keen to see the Government lay down some clear guidelines, as articulated by Chief Constable Sims at the Home Affairs Committee, that give absolute clarity about what is and what is not acceptable in relation to the retention of deeply sensitive personal data.</p>
<p>I fully understand the concerns of the public about that retention. The key points for me are as follows. First, I continue to stress that the retention of DNA is critical for serious crime investigation&#151;I emphasise &#147;serious&#148;. On the successes, one case in the press only yesterday&#151;an historical case solved through the use of DNA&#151;describes better and more articulately than I can the reason why we need to use this proportionately, carefully and sensitively, and within some clear guidelines about what is acceptable in terms of retention, particularly in relation to unconvicted individuals.</p>
<p>I stress from a professional police perspective, however, that just because someone is not convicted of an offence, there are still good professional reasons why we need that information when dealing with serious crime. In my previous world, in Northern Ireland, some very dangerous people were entirely innocent in law&#151;as in, they were never convicted&#151;but I was greatly reassured that I had a better position in terms of keeping the public safe by knowing that I had some information, which, if crimes were committed by those individuals, I could use to deliver an effective investigation, certainly in accordance of article 2 of the Human Rights Act.</p>
<p>I will keep my comments as brief as that, because I am mindful that this is a Bill Committee, not the Home Affairs Committee. I shall hand over to Gary, who may want to touch on some key changes and proposals in the Bill, which we support fully.</p>

<p> Thank you, Sir Hugh. I ask Gary Pugh to give his overview.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I am here today in the capacity of chair of the National DNA Database Strategy Board, which is relevant to the Bill in terms of the governance arrangements for the database. I hold that post as the nominee of ACPO.</p>
<p>I agree with Sir Hugh&#146;s comments, to which I shall add my own from a police perspective, and certainly from the perspective of the National DNA Database Strategy Board. It is imperative that we get some guidance from Parliament and the Committee on retention periods in relation to those arrested and not convicted. This is a live and sensitive debate and I deal with this on a daily basis. There is a risk that if we do not deal with the issue, it could undermine confidence in police investigations generally.</p>
<p>I should like to mention three things. First, on the performance of and contribution to the database, there is an element of trading statistics here. There are two issues for me. I reinforce Sir Hugh&#146;s points on violent crime and sexually motivated crime. You have only to think about the nature of those crimes to understand the potential for DNA to be transferred from the perpetrator to the victim or the crime scene, and therein lies the value of DNA. What we have done in the UK is much broader than that, however. We use DNA profiling in a much wider range of crime, particularly burglary and acquisitive crime. There is a different set of evidence for the value of that, in terms of the number of matches that are made from the national DNA database.</p>
<p>The majority of the output from the database is, in volume crime, in identifying potential offenders. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the study in the States&#151;I think it is one of the most rigorous studies&#151;that looked at what difference DNA makes. It found that twice as many people were arrested when DNA was involved and twice as many people were put into the criminal justice system. That was a Department of Justice study.</p>
<p>The second broad area for us is the mechanics of the Bill and the proposals. Clearly, the retention periods are a matter for Parliament. Our plea is for simplicity in being able to administer the Bill and its implications when it becomes law. We want to be confident that the proposals can be implemented through what I would describe as a systems approach, rather than through police officers managing individual records. There is &nbsp;potential here for us to be managing 5 million individual records. That would draw on a lot of police resources that would be better used elsewhere.</p>
<p>Finally, on the deletion process, we strongly support a centrally managed, transparent process and clear guidance on that set out in regulations. We support that and feel that we need it in light of the recent media interest.</p>
<p>Those are the points that I would like to highlight in my opening statement. I shall close there.</p>

<p> What percentage of the 33,000 crimes detected using the national DNA database were direct detections, as opposed to indirect detections, where somebody subsequently confessed to multiple crimes? That does not link into your comment about volume, but I will come back to that in a minute. Do you have figures to hand to show how convictions and crimes solved are split between the two categories?</p>
</speech>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> The simple answer is no. There is a point here about the contribution that DNA profiling makes and, in a sense, we are looking for a causal link. We can identify those cases in which there was a DNA match and a detection, but the precise input provided by that the DNA match would almost require a case-by-case study. That is not to duck the issue, but to say that that is the way that DNA works in policing. DNA does not convict anyone; it provides a starting point for an investigation. I can go and look at the 33,000 detections in more detail, but I will come up against that problem.</p>

<p> It is just that you can see the potential criticism here. There are 33,000 detections, but only a small minority might have been direct detections, as opposed to people confessing to 15 burglaries. We are trying to work out the value of profiling, so this is quite an important issue.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2010-01-26_CRIMEANDSECURITY_02-0_2010-01-26a.1.16" nospeaker="true" time="16:17" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmpublic/crimeandsecurity/100126/pm/100126s01.htm#10012687000030" colnum="41">
<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> I can say from my experience in the Metropolitan police&#151;I must reinforce that this is about the role of DNA profiling and the databases in identifying a potential offender, giving us a name to start an investigation&#151;that there are many cases where we already have a potential suspect, so we are talking about making a one-to-one comparison, rather than a search of the database. Thirty to 40 per cent. of detections result from identifying the offender in the Metropolitan police fingerprint and DNA databases. Therefore, by providing a name, DNA profiling and fingerprints make a powerful contribution in what is a difficult situation today, because people move around and our knowledge of communities, and even criminal communities, is not as it was many years ago.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can add another point, which relates to the evidence that we gave to the Home Affairs Committee. It was widely reported that only 0.67 per cent. of crimes were solved using DNA. That is perhaps unfair, in that in the vast majority of crime, we do not look for and we do not find DNA. You therefore need to look at the proportion of crimes in which we look for and find DNA. Many crimes, such as shoplifting and fraud, do not provide the opportunity to find DNA to compare with samples on the database. The 0.67 per cent perhaps undervalues the contribution of DNA profiling.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> May I just add to that, Sir Nicholas? The issue of the complexity in policing is one that I have been trying to articulate since I took up my present job. It is hard to say that DNA was the decisive thing in a particular case, although with some rapes, you can pretty much say that the overwhelming evidence was provided by DNA because of the nature of its recovery; but DNA is part of the critical mass that gets you to the point where the prosecution can be mounted and it is part of the interview plan that allows officers to put a suspect in a place so that they have to give an explanation that the officers can then deconstruct and use to prove a point through different investigative means. We are talking about DNA being used in the holistic sense of an investigation, rather than saying precisely, &#147;DNA can solve this.&#148; A fingerprint is exactly the same; it puts a person in a place, and they then have to explain that. Without trying to be over-detailed, DNA profiling is just one technique, but we would argue that is a very important one, and there are many anecdotal cases. I fully understand that anecdotes make bad law.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> If you read some background papers on murders in London last year, you find that senior investigating officers say that DNA was important in about 80 per cent. of those crimes, but they could not properly say that it was the reason for solving the crime.</p>

<p> We may get a sense of dĂ(c)jĂ vu with these questions, having gone through a similar set of questions with the Home Affairs Committee. Nevertheless, I want to come back to this question of the cost-effectiveness of DNA, because I think that in both of your statements you have stated that DNA is effective in tackling crime. Clearly it is effective, but we also now know and have received written confirmation that there is no independent assessment of the cost-effectiveness of DNA techniques. Therefore, it may well be that training officers in how to deal with rape cases, such as the Warboys case, is more effective at solving crime than DNA is.</p>
<p>In the Home Affairs Committee, we have had Greg Hands giving evidence in which DNA was taken from him as a Member of Parliament and from his extended family, including his elderly aunts, with police officers travelling the length and breadth of the country to &nbsp;collect that information. I would like some guarantee from you that there is actually something that can demonstrate that DNA is an effective use of taxpayers&#146; money, in preference to using that money to recruit more officers, provide more training or in another way, because we do not need the Bill to concentrate on DNA if, in fact, there are more effective ways of tackling crime.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> As I have just described, DNA is one of the techniques. That does not detract from the fact that there are individual cases where we have not got it right. We fully accept that, on occasion, police officers do not get it right, and training has a critical part to play in effective police investigation.</p>
<p>However, I want to step back from saying that, by taking away the money from investing in DNA, we could do something that is likely to be more effective. Frankly, the reason for that is that, in serious crime, where the costs of an extended investigation are likely to be exponentially higher than in the routine of the business&#151;we do not use DNA for that anyway, so it is not part of the argument&#151;I would be deeply nervous if we lost the technique. I think it is essential.</p>
<p>We have to keep ahead. We need the technology. As technology has got better, as we have advanced the processes and the methods by which we capture DNA and develop it, the use of DNA has become more effective. The value is huge, but it is very hard to put a value on it and say, &#147;This costs x-thousand pounds and if I shifted that to something else, I could be more effective.&#148; It is how you carve up the police cake.</p>
<p>Where there is some value is not in that end of the business, but in having clarity&#151;not about the cost, but the confidence. Where the Bill goes a substantial way post the judgment is hopefully to give the confidence that DNA will be properly managed and that it is Parliament that has decided what is acceptable and not police officers dealing with this flaky idea of what is an &#147;exceptional circumstance&#148;. I think that&#146;s the real thing. It is an opportunity-cost, but I think it is very important.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> I would add to that. We have had the dialogue. There is not an underlying business case, if you like, for the use of DNA profiling but, as I have said before in other forums, there is not an underlying business case for other aspects of policing.</p>
<p>What I would say is that we do not use DNA in dealing with a lot of relatively minor crime. Perhaps to add to my comments earlier, I should say that there is a forensic intervention&#151;a scene examination&#151;only in about 17 per cent. of recorded crimes. So we are focused on using DNA profiling on those crimes where we are likely to recover DNA, particularly serious acquisitive crime and violent crime, and on those crimes where a search of the database may, as Sir Hugh said, provide a name that is a starting point for the investigation.</p>
<p>In many of those instances, we would not have got that name by any other route. So an investment in other aspects of policing would not have given us the name of that suspect to start an investigation. Therein lies some of the value of DNA profiling and the database.</p>

<p> Mr. Pugh, you said that DNA does not convict anyone, but of course around the country forces now have cold case review &nbsp;teams and very often the only evidence that the police and, in due course, the CPS will have is the DNA evidence. That is exactly what the cold case review team does: it takes DNA evidence, it compares it and it is making quite sure that people who might have committed rapes or murders 10, 15, 20 years ago actually get caught. That is right, is it not?</p>

<p> I do not think anyone is seriously suggesting that you should have the opportunity of anything other than being able to use DNA. Is not the issue public concern about innocent people having their DNA retained?</p>
<p>I think, Sir Hugh, you put it rather well, really, because it seemed to me as a defence counsel that you got it absolutely right. So far as the police are concerned, there are three kinds of people. There are those who are guilty; there are those who are not guilty; and there are those who the police think, know and feel are guilty but they just have not managed to get enough evidence to convict them.</p>
<p>Is there not a suspicion among large numbers of members of the general public that even though you may not actually have managed to bring a prosecution, sod it, you are jolly well going to keep their DNA, as much as anything to say to them, &#147;We think you&#146;re guilty; we think there&#146;s something untoward about you, and this is a way we&#146;re going to retain that information.&#148; Is not that a concern that many people have?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> I think it is slightly more sophisticated than a sort of &#147;Sod it, we&#146;ll keep it&#148; approach. The reality of policing&#151;I can talk about the real world in which I and my officers operate&#151;is not black and white. You are absolutely right; it is the grey area that we are talking about. People who are guilty, we understand. The people we are talking about are those who are lawfully arrested but not convicted.</p>
<p>Within that spectrum, you have people who are entirely innocent in law at one end, and people who in our judgment and based on our intelligence are extremely dangerous people who have been acquitted, or who have never been through a court, because, for example, the witnesses are so terrified they will not give evidence. They are people who are then back out in communities committing serious damage. We think we need a proper system, subject to Parliament&#146;s rules, to retain their DNA for the safety of the wider community. You are absolutely right. That is the judgment call that we are saying, and my colleague Chris Sims said, we need guidance on.</p>

<p>The point you make is a good one, however. There are individual cases that, for whatever reason, are deemed exceptional. There is an issue of chief officers having to consider whether they can deal with that within the current guidelines. What we are saying is that we want clearer guidelines around the routine of the business, not the exceptions. I am happy to accept, and I accept absolutely, that there are exceptional cases. In exceptional cases I do think that we can get more consistency between chief constables. I have looked at the numbers. There is a variety of interpretations of what is exceptional, but in that case the DNA database issue was dealt with by a chief and the material was removed&#151;unless you are going to tell me otherwise.</p>

<p>If chief constables act in different ways and consider that they are not acting unreasonably, do we not need to move to the sort of system that the Chairman of the Select Committee on Home Affairs suggested on Second Reading&#151;an independent arbiter to determine what DNA should be retained and what DNA should be deleted?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> I think it is exceptional. As we said in our opening remarks, we are very keen for this to be codified by Parliament, to the point where you remove 90 per cent. or even 99 per cent. of these issues, because there will be absolute clarity on what can be retained and for how long. I still think that there will be some cases where we would need the flexibility for chief officers to make the decision&#151;it could be a malicious allegation, or the sample was volunteered. Although there are plans for people who volunteer to have their DNA taken&#151;perhaps they are now outside the loop&#151;but in cases of mistaken identity or something like that, where it is absolutely clear that it should not be on the database, it is not right, we should be able to make those decisions.</p>
<p>The more we narrow that, the more I can deliver consistency across the current structure of policing, which as you know is 44 forces with 44 chiefs. You have to look at each case, and if one looks at refusals to date, they vary from 0 per cent. to 50 per cent. granted. Of course, there is a huge disparity of numbers in that, and some forces had only two requests. I am not surprised; others had many more.</p>

<p> May I say to the Committee, and our witnesses, that the Minister has indicated to me that Damian Green&#146;s name has been taken off the DNA database&#151;as far as the Minister is aware.

<p> Are there not two possible issues? The first is the confidence of knowing that if your DNA is taken and recorded, you will not be wrongly accused of something at a later date because of a problem with that DNA evidence. Is that not the underlying reason why many people are a little concerned about having their DNA retained in the circumstances that we have described?</p>
<p>The second issue is the knowledge that one&#146;s DNA details are recorded. A person might know that his neighbour had had a visit from the police at a certain time in the morning&#151;he saw the cars pulling up and the officers hammering on the door&#151;but he will not necessarily know, unless the neighbour decides to tell everyone, that his neighbour&#146;s DNA had been retained and was on record.

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> In terms of wrongful conviction or accusation, I am confident that the DNA profiling method that we use is very robust; it is controlled and accredited. We in the UK have invested heavily in setting scientific standards that the rest of the world has adopted.</p>
<p>In terms of the results, I am entirely confident of their reliability. I think, though, that I would make the point that if we find DNA that we believe to be from the perpetrator on the victim or at the crime scene, that is one of the strongest safeguards against a false accusation or wrongful conviction. A lot of what we do is elimination. Finding DNA or fingerprints is, I believe, a safeguard for the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>As for the sensitivities around DNA and its retention, I understand that. People have written to me and they are very concerned. I think that that relates to the debate about DNA as the blueprint of life, and members of the public are very concerned about what we will do with the samples. The legislation contains proposals for the destruction of the samples, and therefore of the cellular material. Some of the concerns&#151;that we might sell the cellular samples to insurance companies, for example&#151;will be removed by that destruction. However, we have been very firm in resisting access to those samples for any purpose other than investigating crime, and we have taken cases all the way to the High Court on that, so we have put some safeguards in there.</p>
<p>My final point on sensitivity is that there is a legitimate debate about the use of genetic testing. That is not an issue about the DNA database. There is a DNA ethics group that Ministers have set up, and the chair of that group and I are looking at that debate. It is potentially possible&#151;I stress the word &#147;potentially&#148;&#151;to test some unidentified body fluid at a crime scene for medical conditions and so on, which takes us into a highly sensitive area. The chair of the ethics committee, who sits on the board, and I are clear that we need to deal with the ethics of that first, before we fall into doing it. That is not a database issue, but one about information from the crime scene that might help us to identify the perpetrator. I draw that clear distinction.</p>

<p> There are people on the database who have been convicted of more minor crimes. That obviously might assist in the future, as you have suggested, in detecting a more serious crime that might be committed, but I would like some idea of how likely it is that someone who commits a minor offence will go on to commit a more serious one, with regard to the population as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> Some interesting work by the Jill Dando Institute suggests that criminals do not keep to one sort of crime, so we would argue that if someone has been arrested for a fairly minor offence, it does not necessarily mean they will not go on to commit more serious offences. On the other side, one could argue that many murderers commit only one offence of murder, perhaps in a domestic environment. It is one of the most serious crimes, but it does not necessarily follow that they will have committed more minor crimes. Our preferred choice of keeping it simple and straightforward recognises that for a substantive conviction for an offence, the sample would stay on the database to cover that.</p>
<p>There is also some evidence from cases of sex offenders&#151;I go back into the mists of time to when I ran the murder teams in south-west London. An example &nbsp;is the case of Robert Black and the Maxwell, Hogg and Harper murders, which took place across the country many years ago. There is evidence, if you go back into criminal histories, that people start with low-level offences, certainly with sex crimes. It can start with indecent exposure and slowly escalate over time to far more serious crimes. I would be nervous about a system in which we tried to say that criminal damage is different from an assault or something else. The simpler we keep it, the more likely we are to have a database with some added value. I do not know whether Gary has the same view.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> From the point of view of evidence, our view is that we need some base of evidence&#151;that relates to the debate about confidence in the database&#151;and, therefore, the retention of samples from those who are arrested but not convicted. The Jill Dando Institute did some initial work for the consultation. I have since seen in the Government&#146;s proposals the base of evidence that shows that in a period of six years after an arrest, the risk of being arrested again is higher than for the population at large, which provides some of the basis for the current proposals on retention. That is where we need to look, in a sense, for the evidence that supports retention periods.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> I think there is. I do not think that there is any desire within policing to expand it in that way at all. I certainly have not sensed that from my colleagues. We think the current system is about right. We fully understand the ruling of the European Court, so we are now looking for some clarity on what is reasonable. I very much believe that is not a judgment we should make; it is a judgment that Parliament should make&#151;it is that important. That is the reason for our support for the proposals on a clearly defined period of time that we think is reasonable and proportionate and balanced against the greater good in terms of protecting the public. We have been very clear: this is not a science. I am sure that if we had everybody on the database, we would probably solve more crime, but that would be grossly disproportionate to what we are trying to deal with, which is getting the balance right in an imprecise science&#151;investigation, rather than the specifics of DNA. DNA adds huge value. That is my professional judgment and, indeed, the evidence based on convictions, but I would be nervous about stepping too far, because you then lose the confidence of the wider community because they see this as a Big Brother state. What we are asking for is clarity about what is reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> Broadly, we are where the Bill is. The initial response from ACPO, you will remember, was a 10-year period, but mindful of the comments Gary has already made on the science of a six-year cut-off, I think we are persuaded. That gives us confidence that we can do our job, the public can be protected and the public can have reassurance that a very careful balance is being struck by Parliament and this is the right way to go.</p>
<p>On the Scottish system, I shall make a couple of brief points. Gary may have some more detail. Gary&#146;s plea at the beginning was to keep it simple. Of course, the Scottish DNA contribution to the database is about 4.5 per cent., and it is quite a complex system. To multiply that to the tune of 19 times would be very difficult administratively. For the unconvicted data in the Scottish system, which as you know are linked to sex crimes or crimes of a sexual nature, the period is three years, followed by potential appeals to a sheriff every two years. That is a complicated system in a different judicial structure, where the fiscal, of course, has a major role to play. Gary may want to add to that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> The Scottish model is based on three years and, as Sir Hugh described, applies to sexually motivated crime. I will just reinforce the two comments. &nbsp;It is a different system, which, from what we have seen of it, requires quite a high degree of manual input to manage all those records. As I said, the scale of doing so in England and Wales would be significant, and it would take up an inordinate amount of police resources to manage the Scottish system.</p>
<p>On the retention period adopted in Scotland&#151;it was reviewed by Professor Fraser&#151;my understanding is that there is not the same base of evidence behind it as there is behind the system in England and Wales, which arrives at six years rather than three. From our perspective, we need a view from Parliament&#151;although I do not wish to push it back on you&#151;that decides on the basis of the information what that retention period should be.</p>

<p> Can I press you on the answer you gave my colleague, Mr. Rosindell? You both said that you were broadly content, or in agreement, with the provisions in the Bill for six years. That basically means that you concede that DNA should be destroyed or not held after a time period. What I do not understand is that if you have conceded the principle, why six years? Why should it be such a long period? What, in your mind, is so good about six years, apart from the fact that it is in a Bill produced by the Government?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> I will ask Gary, but it very much involves, as you said, the suggestion that the evidence of reoffending after six years is something to hang the six years on. Maybe he will be able to give a bit more detail.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> We very much want something rooted in evidence or some analysis of the risk. The information produced in support of the Bill certainly persuades us that six years is right in terms of minimising that risk.

<p> Hang on a minute. There are cases in this country&#151;I suspect quite a lot of them&#151;when people are arrested completely wrongly. They are totally innocent of the crime with which they are charged, they have a blameless life vis-Ă -vis committing crimes before that point and they are found innocent, or it is decided not to proceed with the court case, yet the DNA is on record. Why do you need six years to keep that DNA in order to check, because of other statistics on known criminals who have committed offences, whether they will reoffend?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> My answer is that the process for dealing with that is the deletion process, or the exceptional case procedure as it is now called. If we strengthen that, making it more consistent and transparent, the individual you described who poses no risk should be removed via that process.</p>

<p> At the moment, in my county of Essex, previous chief constables&#151;I do not know about the current one; there has just been a change&#151;refused every request in every case I have had involving a constituent who made representations to the chief constable. Those people had never in their life committed an offence. One person was never charged with any offence when their DNA was taken. Another was actually the &nbsp;victim of crime. It then transpired that the court case collapsed, and the magistrates expressed amazement that any prosecution was made, as he was the victim of the crime, not the perpetrator. Yet the chief constable would not remove the DNA.</p>
<p>You can argue&#151;it is a cop-out in one way&#151;that the Bill will, hopefully, redress such situations and that Parliament should express its view in a uniform way. But it does not get around the original point of the question: why should someone who has no record of committing a crime, who is never charged with or convicted of a crime, have their DNA held for six years?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> If I could find a case where I was absolutely satisfied that the person was completely innocent&#151;well, life is not like that. There may be individual cases exactly like that. The exceptional case may&#151;I understand your point about consistency&#151;cover some of those cases. If we can deal the majority out into a routine system, then perhaps those that are truly exceptional can still come to the attention of chief constables.</p>
<p>I absolutely undertake to try to develop some consistency across the country because there is, as you say, an inconsistent approach. I am unsurprised by that. We have a structure of 44 chiefs who have different views on what is exceptional and on each case on its merits. Equally, the counter-argument is that there are some people who are equally innocent in law but who are extremely dangerous. I do not have the skill to distil one from the other. None of us does, which is why we are asking for clarity&#151;where Parliament says, &#147;In our view, this is the best balance we can strike.&#148; I accept that it will not be perfect in any way, shape or form.</p>

<p> Can we talk a little about the practicalities of how that retention and deletion will work? Clearly it is quite complicated in terms of who has their DNA retained&#151;whether they are adults or under-18s, whether the DNA is retained for six, five or three years and whether they are exceptional cases. What prospect is there of that process operating with anything like 90 per cent. effectiveness in all the different police forces that presumably are all using different systems? Perhaps they are not; they may all be using identical systems and so can be calibrated to do this automatically. At a glance, my impression is that whether things happen at the time that anyone expects will be very hit and miss.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> It is about the police national computer and the database on it of information linked to the fingerprint database and to the DNA database. There is an existing system that manages this process. The proposed approach allows us effectively to develop an algorithm so that when we start from the point of arrest we know the point at which something should be deleted. It is possible that someone is rearrested and the clock restarts. The current system does not propose a human intervention to make an assessment, which is where we would get into a heavy resource requirement on the police service. I am reassured that it should be able to be done by the system, by designing an algorithm that highlights the records that will need to be destroyed at the appropriate point.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> No, because it is a set of rules for which an algorithm can be written. I am confident that although it may be a complex algorithm, it can be written and it can be done. I also draw some comfort from the fact that there is a system in the PNC for weeding criminal records, although not for addressing this issue. So it has been done before&#151;in terms of how we weed records based on previous legislation and the way we operated the PNC. My confidence is high that an algorithm can be written that will flag up records that need to be deleted.</p>
<p>There is a communication link between the relevant databases that will give an alert for the need for deletion. The system will still need to be managed, developed and implemented but it is a lot easier than requiring, as the Scottish system does, a human intervention.</p>

<p> On that point, if someone is very unhappy that their DNA is on a database when they have committed no offences, surely they have to be told, if only to reassure them that it has been removed, regardless of the fact that it might cost some money. Given the money that public bodies and Governments spend in other areas that one could question, surely the least one could do is send written confirmation to the individual to put their mind at rest that they are no longer on the database. It seems odd that you think that you should not send out confirmation letters just on cost grounds. What happens if people write to get an assurance? There are some people&#151;it may seem extraordinary&#151;who are deeply suspicious of the state and want that assurance.</p>

How we manage what will become an automated deletion process, not requiring an intervention from someone, has some practical issues.

<p> It is a matter of clarification for me, Sir Nicholas. Going back to Mr. Burns&#146; point about what is most contentious about retaining DNA&#151;that is, the issue of innocence&#151;let us say that someone is arrested but found to be innocent and does not go on to offend at a later date, and that someone else is innocent initially but does go on to offend later. Is it not a fact that they are both part of the same group, which, according to research, is more likely than the general population to be arrested again? Is it not the case that the time scale for that is beyond six years, though for the purpose of the Bill the Government have chosen six years as a cautious cut-off point? Is that not the case?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Gary Pugh:</span> The simple answer is yes. There is a tail and there is a risk. The risk lies in the individual who is arrested, not convicted, and after six years commits a crime&#151;possibly a violent one&#151;and we would not then detect that individual. That is the risk we are balancing against retention.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> I understand your point. They are different systems and one could make a hypothetical case where we would get a result in England and Wales but not under the Scottish system. As for the notion of me going to Scotland, I suspect they are rebuilding Hadrian&#146;s wall as we speak. That is not something I plan to do. There are differences. Although the judgment refers to the Scottish system as one that would fulfil the criteria that they were looking for, the big complexity that concerns us is that the Scottish legislation is 4.5 per cent. of the total database and it is a bureaucratic system. There is real potential for searching the database and, by the time the bureaucracy has been dealt with, finding that a search is unlawful because people just have not managed to get through the system and it should have been deleted. I am not sure what the law is when that happens. It is a complicated system and requires a lot of human effort.</p>
<p>As I have already said, I know my colleagues and can speak with authority on this. We are spending a lot of time trying to focus on the front end&#151;the operational end&#151;of policing. They would be nervous about a system that meant they had to take more resources from front-end service delivery to deal with a system that is, by definition, far more complicated and bureaucratic.</p>

We are saying, on behalf of our colleagues in England and Wales who have 95.5 per cent. of the system, that it would be complicated, and part of that is scale rather than the way it is done.</p>

<p> From the Chair, I would not comment on that matter.

<p><span class="italic">Sir Hugh Orde:</span> I go back to the six-year suggestion. As I tried to articulate at the beginning, just because someone is found not guilty does not mean that they have not committed a crime; it means that we have failed to achieve the very high standard, quite properly, of proof beyond reasonable doubt to convict. That is where the complexity lies and it is the grey area of &nbsp;policing that we are talking about. We have to make decisions day in, day out around handling some of these people, who are in your communities and who are dangerous. It is a great reassurance to me as chief, and to many of my investigators, to know that we have some handle on these people.</p>
<p>We have not raised the issue to date&#151;I think it is worth mentioning, although it is very hard to quantify&#151;of the deterrent effect when one of the players knows that we have their DNA on the database if they are considering continuing their criminal career, having been acquitted of a potentially serious crime. This is exactly the grey area of policing that we are talking about. We think that six years strikes the balance.

I make no apology for putting it that way. It is a matter for Parliament to decide. As I have said, our initial submission was 10 years, because, as one would expect of professional officers, we like to keep every opportunity that we can, but, on reflection and on the drafting of the Bill, we were happy with six. That was the professional judgment of my senior colleagues and we are happy with six years. You can make an argument for any number of years&#151;for ever would increase the chances again. The balance has to be between being reasonable and proportionate and being mindful of current Strasbourg law and the judgment of the European Court, which has generated some of this debate. What I am saying on behalf of my chief officers is that we think that six years is okay.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> Thank you, Chair. The first thing to say is that at Liberty, we are not critical of absolutely everything in the Bill, which makes a very nice change. For example, we are very pleased to welcome the scaling down of reporting requirements with stop-and-search. We are glad that the proposals intend to allow ethnicity to continue to be recorded, as that is extremely important for monitoring purposes. We think that scaling back the bureaucracy of stop-and-search will be a useful way of freeing up more police time for the very important community engagement role that they have. Sadly, the proposals to continue to retain innocents&#146; DNA, in a blanket and indiscriminate way, have really overshadowed the positive elements of the Bill. It is on those proposals that we will focus as the Bill makes its way through Parliament.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Dr. Helen Wallace:</span> We have a very similar position to Liberty. First, we very much welcome the provision to destroy the samples, which we have been very concerned about in the past. However, on the retention of innocent people&#146;s DNA profiles, we prefer something along the lines of the Scottish system. We have also highlighted the failure to delete the police national computer records, which we see as significant in terms of the individuals who contact us with concern about the DNA database. We have some other concerns about the provisions to expand the collection of DNA. We do not necessarily disagree in principle with some of the intentions behind those provisions, but we think that they are too widely drawn and that there could be some practical problems with them that have not been properly thought through.</p>

<p> This will help to frame the debate. We have had to wrestle with this issue as Ministers and as parliamentarians, and we will have to wrestle with it during the next few weeks and months. However, I would like to start at the beginning.</p>

That gives us the nub of our argument and, in a sense, I just want to clear the desk straight away, so I can get your view as to what we should do in that circumstance, when faced with potential evidence that brings 23 individuals to court and is proportionate, but we could not do that if we adopted the Scottish model. I think that ultimately that issue will frame our debate, in terms of the opposition to the Bill.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Dr. Helen Wallace:</span> I have looked at previous reports. However, my understanding of that research, where it has been cited elsewhere and from what the National Policing Improvement Agency and others have said about it, is that that is not what that research has found. That research has found a number of matches with innocent people&#146;s DNA and senior police officers and senior detectives were asked whether they thought that those matches played an important role in those cases.</p>
<p>What that does not tell you is the extent to which those matches were necessary to solve those crimes&#151;in other words what role that matching played, as you heard from previous witnesses, in identifying those individuals to the extent that they might not otherwise have been identified. Until we see that information with regard to those cases, I am not prepared to say that that is true.</p>

<p> I will happily look at what information we can put into the public domain during the passage of the Bill.</p>
<p>For the purposes of conjecture, however, let me just say something else. If we could prove that there was simply one case that was between three years and six years old and that DNA retention of innocent persons&#146; initial DNA led to a conviction in that case, would you still oppose the Bill? If we could prove that, would you still oppose the Bill?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> May I answer that question, because I take exactly the same position as Dr. Wallace on the issue of retention and we at Liberty would much prefer the Scottish system?</p>
<p>It is useful to hear the evidence that you have just cited although, as Dr. Wallace said, we have yet to see that evidence and we have found it very difficult to get hold of. As far as we are concerned, the evidence that has been published does absolutely nothing to demonstrate any statistical reason why retention for six years is necessary. The evidence that has been published by the Home Office demonstrates that it has only been able to extrapolate from three years of data that six years might be a useful figure. It is not actually based on an analysis of six years of data.</p>
<p>Also, and most importantly in our mind, there is the idea that you are comparing the likelihood of future arrest of those previously arrested with the future arrest of the rest of the population, not with the potential for future conviction. Equating arrest and conviction is an extremely dangerous road to go down in a free society and we were quite frankly shocked by the evidence when it was produced and we understand that it has been entirely written off in the scientific community.</p>

<p> I just wanted to frame the debate, in the sense that this is a debate that we will be having, because all of us want to see people who are guilty being brought to conviction and justice given to families. Our point is what is the maximum period, within European regulations and the judgment that has been made, for which we can retain DNA, which respects rights and has an evidential base but which at the same time maximises the potential for convictions? I simply say that if the debate shows that there is within that period a reasonableness and that there are individuals who are ultimately convicted of crimes between three and six years old under this system, because their DNA has been retained, would you still oppose the Bill, because that system seems to me to be bringing justice to individuals? That is the debate&#151;I do not want to frame it. Colleagues will ask questions. But I think that is the nub of our debate.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Dr. Helen Wallace:</span> There are a range of worries. We get phone calls from people all the time, so I have talked to a lot of people about it. There is obviously concern about the samples which will be dealt with. They contain personal health information. Your DNA sequence can be used to track you or your relatives; your DNA is on the glass that you have been drinking from. People are concerned about potential surveillance. People are concerned about their names being on what is essentially a permanent list of suspects, which is what happens now that your record is retained on the police national computer saying that you have been arrested and your DNA has been taken. That can have practical implications, such as being shown to your employer.</p>
<p>On the issue of false matches, you have to be careful. DNA is unique to you, probably, unless you have an identical twin, but the profile that is kept on the database is not unique to you. It contains only 10 numbers, which are based on parts of your DNA sequence, so there is a probability of a match entirely by chance. It is quite a low probability&#151;as Mr. Pugh explained, it is about one in 1 billion&#151;but it increases if the crime scene DNA is &nbsp;partial, which is very often the case. It is often a degraded sample and not a full profile. You get more false matches the more comparisons you do, so there is genuine concern among forensic scientists that once you share matches across Europe, which will happen from 2011, more false matches will occur by chance.</p>

<p> I want to pursue a little the question of false matches. I am not sure whether you were here earlier and heard our discussions about the cost-effectiveness or otherwise of DNA. If I understand you correctly, if more people go on the DNA database, especially following its extension as a result of European co-operation whereby DNA matches will be pan-European, it would inevitably lead to a greater number of false matches. That could lead to the police pursuing many red herrings. I presume that you are advocating a proper assessment of whether an extension of the DNA database would be helpful for the police?</p>

<p> Secondly, you referred to the failure to delete from the police national computer database. Again, does that refer to the earlier discussion about retention and deletion, and whether a flag is maintained on the PNC to confirm that at some point someone&#146;s DNA had been collected but has since been deleted? If someone carries out a Criminal Records Bureau check, would it show up that they had been on the DNA database at some point? If so, potential employers could use that information for their own purposes.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Dr. Helen Wallace:</span> That is correct. Basically, what happened was that the administrative decision was taken to keep all the police national computer records, in order to be able to see whether or not a person had had their DNA taken, and also to trace them if there was a match. That was a decision that followed the changes in legislation. If you&#146;re removed now, under the exceptional cases procedure, Mr. Green being an example, he would have had his police national computer record deleted, as well as his DNA profile and his fingerprints.</p>
<p>Under the proposals in the Bill, there is no automatic process to delete the police national computer record. We think that is not going to help restore public trust, because individuals on the database will still have those records kept, and they can be used to refuse a visa or a job; that information can be released. Further, it means that the police will also be able to see, if they arrest you &nbsp;again, that you were on the database before and might act differently towards you; they might simply re-arrest you and put you back on the database. It leaves a loophole where you could be indefinitely on the database simply as a result of being re-arrested.</p>

<p> My understanding, which I am pleased to have clarified, is that at the moment there is no PNC access for the database. No one would know that the DNA database was retained on the PNC. Similarly, no CRB check would reflect that because the two are entirely separate. There is no connection between the two at all. No officer would know that someone was on the DNA database when they accessed the PNC; access to the PNC is strictly restricted and nobody else would know, and it is not recorded on the PNC.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> At Liberty we think that in exceptional circumstances it would be justified to keep an innocent person&#146;s DNA on the database. We have never taken an absolutist approach to the retention of DNA. We understand and endorse its uses in detecting and preventing crime, as well as in clearing innocent people. For us, any retention regime has to be informed by principles and most importantly by human rights principles&#151;both &nbsp;those of potential victims and those who might be subjected to crimes, but also of those who might have their DNA retained.</p>
<p>Our position on DNA retention would be one very similar to the Scottish system, whereby it applies to those individuals who have been charged or taken to court where proceedings have been commenced and then stopped for whatever reason&#151;whether that was because there was not enough evidence or somebody was acquitted in court. It would be those individuals charged with serious, violent or sexual offences who would have their DNA retained for a limited period.</p>
<p>We would not endorse an application procedure as you have in Scotland, mainly because the Scottish system is different and they have different verdicts in Scotland, one of which is the verdict of not proven. We do not have that verdict in England and Wales, and we think that having an application process where you are asking a court to determine whether an individual&#146;s DNA should be retained, although they have not been found guilty, would be tantamount to creating a new form of verdict in the English common law system. Our position would be the Scottish system&#151;three years&#146; retention for those individuals charged with sexual or violent offences.</p>

We do not think that any kind of principled engagement has taken place; more that it is an attempt to do as little as necessary to comply with the S and Marper judgment in which we intervened. Incidentally, when the Council of Ministers met last September and considered the Home Office consultation proposals of a 12-year and a six-year retention period, it was noted that the six-year retention period would not be proportionate and would not comply with the Marper judgment.

<p> Would this example pass your test? Matthew Fagan, who was sacked from a London company in 2006, did not receive any conviction. His DNA was taken when he appeared before the police and ultimately he was charged with and convicted of the murder in January 2007 of Cathy Marlow when his DNA was retrieved from under her fingernails. That material matched his DNA. Does that pass your test?</p>

<p> This is the nub of the argument, which is why we need to test it from your perspective as well as from that of colleagues here. We are trying to agree with the verdict of S and Marper, to be proportional about this and to look at the evidence base that we have, but in that particular case, if I accepted the evidence that you have put to us today, Mr. Matthew Fagan would not now be in prison in the United Kingdom. He would not be convicted of the murder of Cathy Marlow. The match of the DNA after a non-conviction, after the three-year period in the Scottish system, has ensured that that individual is now serving that sentence. Should we ignore that?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Dr. Helen Wallace:</span> I have some specific points about this case. The murderer was known to the victim, so it is correct that it is a case where the match was the first lead to that perpetrator, but I do not think I will accept it as a case where the perpetrator would have walked free had they not been on the database. They were a disgruntled former employee who had been sacked from that workplace. They had gone back to burgle the workplace and the victim disturbed them. It was a very horrible case, but it is quite implausible that the police would not have started looking for disgruntled former employees who knew the victim, and later made that match. It is a case that might have been delayed. We do &nbsp;have to take that into account. That is serious, but it is not a case where you can say that the perpetrator was very likely to have walked away.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> First, the fact that nothing in the Bill distinguishes between those innocent people who will be retained. Rather than taking a proportionate approach&#151;looking at the crime for which they have been arrested, the relevance of DNA in solving that crime and other factors like that&#151;all the Bill does is set a blanket, automatic period of six years. When the Council of Ministers considered the six-year period, they said that it would not comply with the judgment or be proportionate. There is a report about the meeting they had which confirms that view.</p>
<p>There has been a lack of willingness to look at the principles laid down in Marper about what a proportionate DNA retention period is. That is the nub of why the current proposals would, we believe, be unlawful.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Dr. Helen Wallace:</span> Only, perhaps, some information regarding the origin of the Scottish model, which did not come completely out of the blue. I was involved in giving evidence to the Justice Committee up there at the time.</p>
<p>The origin of the idea was from the retention guidelines that the Association of Chief Police Officers had in 2000 for criminal records, which were also supposed to apply to DNA profiles at that time. People&#146;s records were supposed to be deleted after 42 days if they were innocent, but there was an exception:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;Details may be retained for a period of five years of offences where a sexual offence is alleged, but the subject is acquitted, or the case is discontinued because of lack of corroboration or allegation of consent by the victim&#148;.</p>
<p>It was looking at that specific category of offences where ACPO had argued at the time that there might be people who were not being convicted but for whom proceedings should nevertheless be treated as some kind of warning sign.</p>
<p>So it is not true to say that it is a completely evidence-free policy; it comes from looking at types of offences where DNA might play a role and where there might be people who are risky in some sense.</p>

<p> Thank you very much. To go back to what I was about to ask, is the issue partly that how the system works at present is that it is inferred that if your DNA is taken, you are by definition a suspect, there is an implication that you have a propensity to offend and some sort of stigma is attached? Would you object less if, a bit like line-ups, ID parades and so forth, there was more random taking of DNA among bystanders and members of the general public who did not necessarily come within that category? In other words, that you tried to reduce or remove any scintilla of a suggestion of stigma by saying, &#147;This is a random sample&#148;. Those people might be included, but by and large, it would be a much more random sample.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> The stigma that you have identified is certainly a huge part of the objections to the current DNA database and as it would stand according to the Bill, but that is only one part. Random sampling of individuals who had done absolutely nothing wrong would be similarly disproportionate and an unlawful invasion of their right to a private life, remembering, of course, how intimate DNA is. Interestingly though, if you are taking a purely statistical approach to DNA retention, which seems to be the road that the Government are going down at the moment, barring the idea that they have incorporated proportionality with the six-year cut-off period, you would retain the DNA of all young men between the ages of 16 and 24, who are more likely to be convicted than those of other ages and those of the other gender. Statistically, if that was all that was informing your DNA retention regime, it would probably be more effective than retaining the DNA of people arrested but not convicted, which is why we say that statistics can form only part of the assessment, and that principles should form another, bigger, part.</p>
<p>The stigma that you identified is one principle that needs to be looked at, as does the discrimination issue. There are many more young black men on the DNA database than any other group.</p>

<p> Can I bring you back to a point that was raised by a Labour colleague? I do not quite understand why certain parts of identity are, in your grounds, more sensitive than others. We are moving to a system whereby if we do not have a compulsory ID card system, increasingly we shall need to show our passports to prove identity. Our passports will be microchipped and the microchip will contain increasingly personal data about us&#151;data entirely related to me. Why should I be more concerned about a nine-digit or 15-digit number that describes my DNA than about a microchip on a passport or an extended national insurance number?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> It is all context and purpose-specific. In the example that you give of a passport, you choose to use that passport to enter and leave the country. You decide to do that by consent and you use the passport to enable you to do so. In my view, that is a different circumstance from the state telling you that it will automatically retain your DNA against your consent for a six-year period because you have been arrested for a suspected offence, but nothing further has happened to you.</p>
<p>With any piece of personal information, a human rights approach to assessing how it should be used and how it can be used would say that you need to look at how sensitive it is. For example, a DNA sample is probably a lot more sensitive than any other piece of personal information. It can tell you about your familial background, your life expectancy and the chance of diseases in later life. It is the most intimate, sensitive piece of information that you have. That is why it is imperative that it is destroyed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A photograph is less sensitive and other identifiers are less sensitive again. You need to look at how sensitive the information is, the purposes for which it is being used, and whether consent has been given. That is how you make a human rights judgment about whether it is appropriate for the state to hold the data.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Dr. Helen Wallace:</span> To add to that, there is a particular point about the Big Brother state and the role that DNA can play in tracking individuals&#151;DNA as a form of bio-surveillance. If you were living in a police state&#151;if we were having an illegal political meeting in this room&#151;the state could come in and test the DNA from your glass, check whether you are on the database and track you and your relatives. Similarly, if the state fails to keep that information safe and a criminal gang manages to infiltrate the system&#151;there has been some concern in Italy about whether the mafia could do that&#151;it could track down potential victims or people under witness protection schemes, rather than the bad guys. If the bad guys are on the database and the good guys are looking after it, it is great.

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> My understanding is that no other European country holds the DNA of innocent people indefinitely, as we currently do, and that most have adopted a system similar to the Scottish system, so for certain violent or sexual offences it can be retained for a limited period.

<p> I understand that. I started practising law before the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, so there are bits of me that are fairly cynical. You heard what Sir Hugh had to say, and clearly one of the issues one has with the administration of justice is that often police officers become totally convinced from their own perspective that although an individual is guilty of an offence, they simply do not have sufficient evidence for a conviction. That is why before PACE so many immaculate confessions purportedly took place in the police car between the point of arrest and arriving at the police station. With regard to the Scottish system, do you not see a risk of police in those circumstances simply charging individuals, even if they do not have sufficient evidence, so as to get their DNA and then simply drop the charges afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> I do not think that you can eliminate risk from the dispensation of criminal justice, which is another very good reason why we would not support the system in Scotland, where there can be indefinite applications for DNA to be retained. In those circumstances, if someone had been charged unlawfully purely so that their DNA could be kept on the database, it could be kept for a period of only three years. That is certainly not ideal if the individual was charged purely in the way you described, but it would be for only three years and no longer.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Isabella Sankey:</span> That judgment is based on the Scottish system, which was, of course, cited with approval in Marper, but also on the well-known fact that there are particularly low conviction rates for sexual and violent offences. It is a principled and practical exception to the rule that you should not retain innocent people on a criminal database.</p>
<p>Could I quickly add one answer to the question whether there was anything we have not been asked about? We are particularly concerned about the national security exception, as that would allow indefinite retention, via the back door, based on something that would be very difficult to challenge by judicial review. Of course, DNA retention is very difficult to challenge anyway by judicial review, but particularly when national security is cited as a reason for retention.</p>
<p>On a point of clarification, I understand that there has been a little confusion about offences for which that exception can be used to retain. It could be used if someone is arrested for any offence. It is not linked in any way to arrest for a terror offence or for a particularly violent one. Somebody could be arrested for the most trivial offence and have their DNA indefinitely retained, because of the national security exception&#151;because the police cite national security. At the very least, we urge parliamentarians to tighten that up, if not get rid of it altogether.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Dr. Helen Wallace:</span> I have two points: not questions you should have asked me but on questions you asked previous witnesses. One related to figures about people on the database, matches with innocent people and so on. I have prepared a submission that includes all those figures for the Home Affairs Committee, which I would be happy to send also to this Committee.</p>
<p>The second point is that the witnesses were rather reluctant to answer the question about their Scottish colleagues&#146; opinion of the system in Scotland. My understanding is that the police in Scotland responded to the Fraser review, for example, and the police liaison officer for the Scottish DNA database in fact consistently argued for the Scottish model and not for the model now being proposed in England and Wales.</p>
