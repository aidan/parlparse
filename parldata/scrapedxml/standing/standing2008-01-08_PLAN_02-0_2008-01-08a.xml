<p><span class="italic">  Robert Upton:  </span> Our thanks to the Committee for the invitation to give oral evidence. I should explain that the Royal Town Planning Institute exists to advance the art and science of planning and that is, among other things, to promote good practice in planning and to contribute to the formulation of policy and legislation. We have been actively involved in discussing proposals for planning reform over quite a few years now and we are broadly supportive of the proposals in the Bill, but we have two major concerns, which I would like to flag up at the beginning.</p>
<p>The first relates to the national policy statements and their role in the new procedure that is proposed. As we see it, the whole system proposed for development consents for major infrastructure projects depends entirely on the adequacy of those national policy statements. In our view, there are four tests that must be met there: clarity; consistency with each other; credibility in terms of the evidence base in the consultation; and the extent to which they manage to be location specific, that is, that they give a sufficiently clear indication of what is required so that impacts can reasonably be assessed. We think that it is essential that the Infrastructure Planning Commission should be required to make an annual report to Parliament on the adequacy of the statements with which it is working, to give a suitable degree of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p>Our second major concern of principle relates to the provision under the Town and Country Planning Act &nbsp;1990 for local member review bodies, which we see as a major breach of the 1947 settlement, which separated the decision-taking from the appeal process.</p>

<p> Finally, because we are rather time limited, although I may catch the Chairman&rsquo;s eye again later, you said in your national policy statements, with happy alliteration, that there should be &ldquo;clarity, consistency, credibility&rdquo;&mdash;but then you could not find a &nbsp;&ldquo;c&rdquo; for the last one&mdash;and that you hoped they were going to be, if I heard you right, very &ldquo;location specific&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Robert Upton:  </span> I think that the national policy statement states an intention. We think that that intention should be as specific as possible, so that there can be the most adequate consultation, but I do not think that it amounts to a planning consent. There are questions around what the IPC should be able to consider in seeking to determine whether a development consent should be given. Should it be restricted simply to the national policy statement or should it be in general accordance with the national policy statement? To what extent should the IPC have regard to all other national policy statements, to planning policy statements and to local development frameworks?</p>

<p> Mr. Upton, you will be aware of the fact that in some planning systems there is a qualified third-party right of appeal. In the paperwork that you have submitted regarding this Bill, you have expressed concerns that might arise from third-party communities and whether they would be heard and so on. Are you satisfied that the conduct of cross-examinations, as foreseen in the Bill, is going to deliver what you are concerned about?

<p> You began to talk about consultation quite a bit. You say you prefer the inquisitorial to the adversarial.

<p> I should like to pursue two issues with you. The first is that, while generally supporting most of the Bill, you have come out strongly against local member review bodies, which have generally been welcomed as part of devolving responsibilities. Maybe it would do one or two of your members out of a job to reduce the amount of work going to the planning inspectorate, but nevertheless, why are members at the local level not capable of making a final decision on the very smallest of planning applications where a dispute arises about the initial decision made by an officer?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Robert Upton:  </span> May I first say that it is not the case that they have been generally welcomed? As I understand it, that provision is the one in the Bill that has attracted the most hostility&mdash;87 per cent. of consultation responses have been opposed to it. The first point is one of principle and goes back to what I called the 1947 settlement, under which it was accepted that in return for having their rights over land possibly curtailed, people should have a right of appeal to a body other than the body that took the original decision. That principle has worked extremely well over the years, and I cannot see any evidence to show why it should change now.</p>
<p>There are two main parts to clause 150, which brings this measure in: the first is the ability of the Secretary of State to designate what should go to elected member review bodies, and the second is his or her ability to specify what decisions might be taken under delegated powers by officers. That is a good thing, which may well increase the speed and efficiency of the process in the case of some less efficient local authorities or local planning authorities, but the concomitant of that is that the public require the reassurance that their appeal will not be heard&mdash;as Mr. Curry says, I had the honour to be the chief executive of a very good local authority, but even in very good local authorities, there are dynamics that would reduce the public perception of the safety of the system.</p>

<p> I might characterise that statement as saying that taking a bit of democracy away and giving decisions to officers is a good thing, while putting a bit of democracy back in and giving more responsibility to members is a bad thing, but that would perhaps be unfair. However, let us say that the local member review body comprised councillors from neighbouring authorities, not the authority for which the officers who took the original decision worked.

<p><span class="italic">  Robert Upton:  </span> I think that that is perhaps a question that you might address more fruitfully to Ministers than to me, because I have very limited influence here. However, as I understand it, the Government&rsquo;s concern is to achieve not only a body that is seen as entirely free standing and which has a range of expertise, some of which may well come from the ranks of the inspectorate, which has a great deal of expertise to offer, but a body that is seen as being focused on all the major infrastructure decisions, as opposed to the vast generality of cases, which run very effectively through the planning inspectorate. That is the distinction. However, you should perhaps put that more firmly to the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>There is one other point that I would like to make on behalf of the institute. I would like to emphasise the significance of the national planning statements, rather than the mechanism by which the development consents are decided downstream. What gives us the chance to move forward in a big way is the requirement that there should be clarity and transparency about &nbsp;what is proposed and that the community, including the business community, has the chance to be engaged in it. That is potentially very important.</p>

<p> I understand that point. I suppose that that not only achieves those objectives, as you rightly say, but prevents re-runs of the terminal 5 situation, in which national policy considerations are mixed up with the individual site inquiry. That is why I was interested in your final two points. You say that the national policy statement must be credible in terms of the evidence base, but it also must be as location specific as possible. If it is to be location specific, how will you have robust and credible testing of the evidence base without allowing the parties interested in the identified site the right to appear before and be heard by the body that decides the national policy statement? Shall we grasp that nettle?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Robert Upton:  </span> First, I think that national policy statements will vary quite considerably in kind. When it comes to discussions about airports, it is quite hard to imagine hypothetical airports. We by and large know where they are or where they might be. When you are talking about wind farms, I think that it is unreasonable to expect the national policy statement to say exactly where 150 wind farms in East Anglia will or will not go; that just will not happen. There is a big difference, but to the extent that national policy statements are more locationally specific and should be more locationally specific, the consultation on those national policy statements should indeed engage with the communities concerned.</p>

<p> I am very interested in the comments that you made about the importance of and the emphasis that you as a planning body place on consultation and engagement in advance. Planning officials within the Government have traditionally taken the view that an application should be considered without regard to who is the applicant. You referred a moment ago to wind farms. It seems to many of us that there is a case for engagement and even ownership of the application by the local community&mdash;wind farm developments are a classic example of this&mdash;being a relevant consideration to be included in the balance. For instance, if the local community has identified where in East Anglia there would be community benefit resulting from a location, that should be a relevant consideration. Would you agree?</p>

<p> The point is that there has traditionally been an approach within Government whereby the consideration of an application should be neutral as to whom the applicant is, whereas the whole point of consultation and engagement in advance and even community ownership of an application&mdash;which has happened in some locations with wind energy&mdash;is that it changes the view of the application.

<p> You spoke earlier about local development frameworks in the context of the community infrastructure levy. As the renewal and introduction of new local development frameworks is a constant process, and as local authorities are at different stages in that, do you think that they ought to be revisited in light of the changes being made by this Bill, because some communities where the LDF is finalised after the Bill becomes law may be at an advantage in terms of negotiations afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Robert Upton:  </span> I think that all local planning authorities should press on with their local development frameworks as fast as they possibly can and review them as they need to. The introduction of a community infrastructure levy will potentially have a very powerful effect on what constitutes a sound local development framework&mdash;in other words, what it is then within the ability of that local authority or planning authority to achieve for its community. I would not want them to stop. I think they should get on with it now.</p>

<p> Can I tempt you back to the community infrastructure levy and perhaps take a different approach from my parliamentary colleague, David Curry, being a listening member of the Committee? I am sure my ministerial colleagues are also listening. The opportunity now to feed into the debate about how the community infrastructure levy should be calculated, and so on, is one of the options that needs to be taken forward. I would be interested to know whether you have taken a view as to what might go into that process, and I was particularly interested in what you said in your response about whether it was going to be kept entirely local, or how far it would go regionally and sub-regionally. I am interested in your views on this.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Robert Upton:  </span> Again, without wanting to duck the question, I think this is something which needs to be discussed. I am not clear at present where the Department &nbsp;for Communities and Local Government wants to go on this. If one had the situation in which, for example, a regional or sub-regional strategy made development contingent upon certain infrastructure provision, then it would be almost perverse to rule out of a plan-based tariff the possibility of some contribution to that. I think the requirement is still that the vast majority of this money should be used in the area in which it is generated. I think there also has to be recognition that some areas will by definition do better than others out of this in terms of their potential, so it should not be interpreted as the chance to cut off all other forms of funding for infrastructure.</p>

<p> May I pursue that issue for a minute, Mr. Upton? In my neck of the woods, we have the Leeds city region concept of Leeds. Craven, one of the district councils in my constituency, has affiliated itself to that city region. The top-left hand corner of Craven is on the Cumbrian border and must be about 70 miles from Leeds city centre.

<p> If I may say so, Mr. Upton, you should not be allowed to get away with that as an answer. The local development frameworks for Leeds and Ingleton are separated by some 60 or 70 miles. Let us move closer to Leeds, then, to the edge of Skipton, which is on the boundary of the Bradford metropolitan area and the Leeds met. Would it be legitimate to say that a development in Skipton should be eligible to make some contribution, or vice versa?</p>

<p> Right; I ask this with very serious intent. In my constituency, there are none of the big projects that we are talking about&mdash;it is quite difficult to put them in the middle of the Yorkshire dales. If I wanted to stop something happening, I would do my best to try to generate at least 10,000 people who wanted to give evidence to the commission, yet we are told that they have got to decide it all within a timetable for the procedures, with the whole lot encapsulated within about nine months, which is an interesting length of time. The Minister reiterated, in her statement, that everybody should be heard. I am not clear how one reconciles the pledge that everybody can be heard with the accelerated timetable, which is, after all, the reason why the Bill exists in the first place. I know that you are not responsible for the Bill, and I do not want to give the impression that I have interrogated you about something of which you are not the author, but do you share my perplexity on this?</p>

<p> I go back to an issue that David Curry raised, but perhaps with a slightly different bias in my question. Is it not the fact that, at present, there can be major, significantly sized developments just outside the boundaries of our large cities that nevertheless put a considerable demand on their infrastructure, and there is no way for those developments to make a contribution under the current arrangements? Is it not therefore reasonable that, in looking at the community infrastructure levy, we might find a way of allowing that to happen through that mechanism?</p>

<p> I shall come on to an issue that I raised this morning with the representatives of the CBI, who commented on it. Essentially, the skills that your planning officers have relate to looking at the types, nature and appropriateness of development and the nature of the charge that we are perhaps getting towards, and the community infrastructure levy would look at those sorts of issues in determining the charge for particular schemes. One aspect, however, that is in the Bill and can be considered when determining the nature or size of the levy is the uplift in valuation that arises when value on the site is increased. Would you have concerns about that criterion being used to calculate the levy and would that cause concerns for planners as it is not a skill they normally have in their locker?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Robert Upton:  </span> With respect, the members of my institution have many skills covering a wide range of issues and are not limited to the ones that you set out, and there are certainly some who would be very competent at looking them. The point, however, is that clause 163(2) refers to the increase in the value due to the permission for development, and we are not convinced that that is necessary or is an issue of value. We think that it is theoretically possible that someone might wish to carry out a form of development that was perceived to reduce the value of the land, but in doing so might raise an infrastructure requirement, and we do not see why they should not contribute to that.</p>

<p> I am interested in your point about how you deal with the evidence being gathered and that you feel that it should be dealt with through an inquisitorial process. In the High Court, great savings have been made, particularly in the commercial division, by judges being much more proactive in the management of hearings by insisting that the issues be defined in advance and intervening much more to pull &nbsp;up counsel. Is there perhaps something that we should learn from that about how to manage inquiries, not just by the IPC, but perhaps by planning inspectors generally, and might not much more robust judicial management&mdash;for want of a better term&mdash;of the process save a lot of time and prevent duplication?</p>

In Wales it would have significant implications for generating stations, both onshore and offshore, and in so far as it is tied to the totality of the development consent and then relates to the infrastructure onshore, in the worst case it could take quite a bite out of devolved powers in Wales. I think our colleagues are anxious that there should be a discussion at some stage between the appropriate parts of Government about what should be transferred.</p>

<p> Thank you very much. That is useful, but I am fascinated by your saying that there is a greater disjunction between the UK and Scotland. To me, that means there is a greater difference.

<p>Local government view planning as a key strategic function. It is the thing that enables us to help to develop prosperous mixed and well-planned communities and to do so with community consent. Therefore anything that takes away that operation should be done very carefully and on a very limited basis. We are persuaded that there is a case for handling very large projects through a different procedure, but with two safeguards. First, the definition of such projects should be drawn very tightly. Secondly, there should be a clear method for local views to be heard and paid attention to through the new process, given that the normal mechanisms of lobbying the local planning authority will not be available.</p>

<p> Sir Simon, the infrastructure levy is going to be quite a complicated business. Do local authorities have the administrative capacity to deliver &nbsp;this? What measures do you envisage your organisation taking to try to establish some sort of common approach across local authorities, or would you be happy if we had a competition between local authorities in the levy they charged so that planning became part of a competitive agenda and there was competition between local authorities to get developments, for example?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> The whole process starts with having a valid local development framework. There have been a number of difficulties for councils getting their LDFs through. One of the things we have lobbied the Government about is simplifying the process. Part of the Bill seeks to tackle that. Through that process you should as a local area be able to come up with an agreed vision of the community infrastructure needs. That will vary from area to area. We are keen that there should be maximum flexibility for councils and communities to define their infrastructure needs. It might be crèches, cycle paths or combined heat and power plants. We should not be prescriptive in the Bill or in guidance as to what that should be. That requirement should then be partly funded through this levy. That is how it should work. Yes, I believe that councils have the capacity to come up with an agreed statement of needs for their local community. That is at the heart of what councils can and should be able to do.</p>
<p>On the second point of your question and whether we see some kind of competition between authorities, the development decision to invest in an area and to seek to develop to build is subject to a whole range of economic and market factors. It could be that in time the demands of a community levy would become a material factor, but I doubt whether it would become such a factor as to outweigh all of the other things such as land values, complexity of development and the reputation of the planning authority as to have a significant and material impact.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> I heard the tail end of the last sitting, so I heard your Craven example. Councils are coming together now in sub-regional partnerships. They are coming together in multi-area agreements and through those are defining what kind of infrastructure &nbsp;is needed for their areas, particularly to do with transport, but also on skills development, economic development and housing. I think that it is entirely reasonable that councils that have come together in that way can agree among themselves to devote a small portion of the levy towards meeting those wider sub-regional needs.</p>

<p> Can I move on to the national policy statements and the IPC? One of the things that concerns me greatly is the degree of consultation that is needed with the national policy statements and the IPC. I wonder whether the Local Government Association has a view on how consultation should be carried out on the development of the national policy statement. A slightly different issue&mdash;I am running the two together&mdash;is how the planning commission should hear the views of local people.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> This goes to the point that I made in my introductory statement about ensuring that there are safeguards to ensure that local views are heard in the new process. The LGA believes that there are one or two mechanisms that would help that could be introduced by amending the Bill. First, on the national policy statement, the Secretary of State should be required to commission and pay for a statement of local community impact, particularly when it comes to allocating a project to a different part of the country. That would be one safeguard. Secondly, when you have a scheme that is going through the commission, the commission should be required to pay for a statement of local views and impact. That would allow the local authority to pull together local opinion and local consultation and present it to the commission. There should be a requirement for those views to be taken into account through the probing and questioning that the commission undertakes on the specific application.</p>

<p> Briefly, just to pick up on the point about the community infrastructure levy, I was interested in what you said about issues, such as skills or transport, and so on, that require a wider view, perhaps, than that of the immediate local planning authority. I have seen that need in my neck of the woods. You say that the Bill should be amended to provide councils with that ability to drive decisions. How far should the Bill go in laying that out? How detailed should it be?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> I do not believe that it should be detailed, because then you create a straitjacket that is too prescriptive. I think these things are best handled by negotiation. Yes, that sometimes takes slightly longer, but it is likely to lead to a better outcome. The LGA would be opposed to having percentage thresholds, with so much going to the sub-region and so much staying locally. I think it has got to be done through negotiation with the affected councils and through their LDF process, which is necessarily consultative.</p>

<p> Thank you for that. On another tack, you are very supportive of the mechanism in terms of local member review bodies in the Bill.

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> I did not hear the RTPI evidence, but I know that it is hostile to politicians getting involved in planning matters. Local member review boards are the right mechanism. It is ridiculous to assume that councillors are qualified to take decisions on very complex major developments but not competent to take decisions on minor planning matters that had been delegated to officers on which there is an appeal. So there is no issue there about the skills or capacity of elected councillors to do the job.</p>
<p>I do not accept that councils would automatically rubber-stamp the decisions that had been taken by officers. That is not the experience of how planning committees work. Councillors operate pretty independently. I think that they would be quite capable of assessing the evidence that was put before them by the appellant and of taking a de novo decision on whether the right initial decision had been taken. That has more legitimacy than having a planning inspector from Bristol come in and seek to take a decision without any real knowledge of local context.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> Yes, I think that we do. We believe that it should be confined to matters of national economic or security importance.

If you were building a trunk road to link a new port, it would clearly be part of that application, but trunk roads per se are not matters of national economic importance; they are quite suitable for being determined by local planning authorities. It is a nonsense, in our view, that they should fall within the remit of the new national commission.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> If we want to go back to basics, why is this Bill here in the first place? It is because Government have deemed it necessary to expedite the way in which we handle applications for schemes and projects of this type. We believe that it is justifiable where it is clearly in the national economic or national security interest to have a process that allows that to be expedited and where there are clear limits and clear guidelines.</p>
<p>If you accept that that is the case then you accept that you are going to ultimately disappoint some people who will not like the decisions that are made because they will not like living next to something which is a bad-neighbour use. However, that is the case in any planning system. There is nothing like a controversial planning application to get people turning up to a meeting at the town hall. We know that people can become very exercised. The best that you can offer as a planning authority, whether you are a council or the national commission, is that people have the opportunity to make their points and that they will be taken into account in making the final decision, whether you like that final decision or not.</p>

<p> Sir Simon, you made the point about the legitimate desire to avoid costs. It is perhaps not appropriate for people in my position to say that if you want to avoid the costs of a Queen&rsquo;s counsel you instruct an experienced junior&mdash;that might be taken in the wrong way. Your Mr. Jones might be able to help, but is it your experience that one of the real problems, and the reason that the legal fees become expensive, is that some inquiries of this large kind drag on because all too often they get sidetracked into the issues that are intended to be part of the national policy statement&mdash;the desirability or otherwise of more air travel, nuclear power or whatever.</p>
<p>One of the important things that one would want to see to cut things down&mdash;silks or no silks&mdash;is the removal of that element from the discussion as to whether the particular application is appropriate in that particular site.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Graham Jones:  </span> I would agree with that and I would go further. One of the fundamentally important aspects of this legislation and the procedures attached to it is that it is an opportunity to limit or rather to define the areas for consideration at the outset, before the process starts. Going back to what we were discussing earlier, the opportunity to have a similar sort of process to that which we have in appeals, where the local authority and the applicant can agree on what &nbsp;they agree on and therefore decide what they disagree on, before the commission undertakes its process, is one which should not be missed. That is one way in which the time scales and the areas of concern can be strictly limited. That is in everybody&rsquo;s favour, if one puts it alongside an inquisitorial rather than an adversarial process.</p>

<p> The interesting point, Mr. Jones, is that although you speak about an inquisitorial process, and you say in your submission that local councils should have a special status for the reasons that you have advanced, you then say at paragraph 4.11 that effective councils must have an opportunity to conduct a cross-examination of evidence from other parties or to require the commission to take that into account in its own cross-examination. It is the specific use of &ldquo;cross-examination&rdquo; that interests me. In some cases, that is the best and most robust means of testing the evidence, provided that it is kept within bounds in the way that we have discussed, and limited to the issues that are really germane.</p>

<p> Looking back to the community infrastructure levy and paragraph 5.2 in your submission, to which David Curry referred earlier, my understanding is that you are generally supportive of the proposals. I am trying to get my head around why you say that the Bill should be amended to provide councils with the power to define local infrastructure requirements, with discretion over how and when CIL funds are used. I thought that that was essentially what the Bill did, and I wondered whether I was missing something if you thought that it needed amending.</p>
<p>If it does need to be amended, do you think that the role of passenger transport authorities should be referred to in the Bill, as they are clearly a key to transport developments in the community?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> The references to community infrastructure levy in the Bill are pretty sketchy because they are to be expanded through secondary legislation, guidance and various other things. It is therefore not very clear at the moment, and we are seeking to put down markers as the Bill progresses. The intention always was that it should be developed as the Bill progresses, so that we can ensure that those things happen&mdash;in other words, that councils are at the centre of determining what the needs are, and that there is flexibility and so on.</p>
<p>The scenario that I favour is one where the councils, through their LDFs, come up with a statement of need. A range of other interested parties will feed into that &nbsp;process to ensure that the LDF takes account of their needs, and passenger transport authorities would be one of those. I see them feeding in through the LDF.</p>

<p> May I ask you about the proposals, for want of a better word, to &ldquo;streamline&rdquo; the local development framework? Some people are concerned that taking away some of the requirements that local authorities currently have to pursue would weaken the requirements on sustainability. Others would argue that the measures are necessary because, to date, LDFs have not gone as quickly through the process as was envisaged. Indeed, many authorities still do not have them in place&mdash;and some of those probably did not have a unitary development plan in place beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sir Simon Milton:  </span> The reason why LDFs have become so log-jammed is interesting. Depending on who you speak to, you could apportion blame in various ways. However, I think that everyone agrees that the process is far too complex at the moment. One of the things that it completely fails to do, in my view, is to engage the public, yet that is so critical to communities. However, it is a very technical subject. I looked at the consultation being put out by my authority for our LDF, and the truth of the matter is that nobody other than highly trained experts would be capable of responding to it. It is not because we are particularly jargon-prone&mdash;no more so than any other council. It is because the requirements set out in the legislation are so demanding and complicated. By simplifying that, we will start to make progress.</p>
<p>I had a meeting, on behalf of the LGA, with the housing and planning Minister at which we agreed to conduct a no-blame review as to why it was that of 40-odd LDFs that had been presented, only nine got through the process. The others had been either rejected or withdrawn. There is a variety of reasons, but it is clear that unless we get that process working smoothly, the whole of the rest of the planning system will fall, because everything is founded on that.</p>

<p> Sir Simon, as you know, probably more than 50 per cent. of social houses in Britain are built through planning gain. Are you absolutely satisfied that nothing in the Bill will make it more difficult or threaten the construction of social housing through the planning gain 106 procedure?</p>

It is, however, the case that the more onerous you make development, the less development occurs. I have a&mdash;I keep saying &ldquo;I&rdquo;; I hope that I am speaking for the LGA when I say that we are looking to the planning system to deliver more and more social benefits, and quite properly, possibly, social benefits from affordable housing to sustainability. The latest iteration is national security. The more you require the planning system to deliver, the more complex you make it and the slower development then becomes. You also risk choking off some development. There is nothing specific in the Bill that would threaten the ability to deliver affordable &nbsp;housing, other than if we end up making the whole planning system too complex, too costly and too onerous.</p>

At the moment we debate endlessly what is the right target for affordable housing to have in your planning policy&mdash;what percentage figure. You can take different views on that, but you need a clear understanding of the point at which it becomes uneconomic for a developer.

<p><span class="italic">  Graham Jones:  </span> I think this comes back in a way to the criteria for the development that will be going through the commission. If we are looking at a handful of national schemes per year, for those particular schemes it is quite feasible that we could devise a unified consent regime.</p>
<p>It also comes back to the issue we were talking about: how you discharge conditions and enforce them, and make sure that all those things can be dealt with properly at a local level, rather than having to go through another layer of consents, which would be locally based rather than nationally based. I think that if we are looking at a much larger number of developments, involving a different scale of development as well, then the issue of unified consent becomes more difficult, because it is affecting a much broader array of schemes, some of which will, by their very nature, be of much more local interest where those other consents would normally kick in, rather than being of national interest. It comes back to the issue of criteria. If the criteria are right, the unified consent regime could work.</p>

I take the opportunity to welcome you, Katrine Sporle, and your colleague, Leonora Rozee. If you would like to make a statement before answering questions, now is the opportunity. You could also do so at the end if you think that anything has been missed and has not been teased out of you by the questions. Is there anything that you would like to say first by way of a brief statement?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Katrine Sporle:  </span> I will just introduce my colleague in a little more detail and tell you that Leonora is deputy chief inspector of the Planning Inspectorate. She is head of profession and has 18 years experience as an inspector. I felt that that might be useful to the Committee as you proceed. I am here specifically to cover work load, resource, and those kind of issues. Leonora is the expert on matters relating to professional issues.</p>
<p>I also want to assist the Committee in clarifying that the Planning Inspectorate is an arm&rsquo;s length Executive Agency. Our sponsors are the Department for Communities and Local Government and the National Assembly for Wales, and we do work for other Departments. I should be very clear that we are not an independent body. We are there to take decisions on behalf of the appropriate Secretary of State of whichever Department, or in order to recommend to the Secretary of State. So we do all our work on case work within existing policy frameworks. I felt that it might be helpful to set that out.</p>

<p> You will have dealt with many cases that affect section 106 agreements. Section 106 agreements &nbsp;were challenged originally by the idea of the planning gain tax&mdash;a daft idea that mercifully has been dropped. However, there is still concern about to what extent one can depend upon those to deliver some of the social goods that come from planning. How confident are you that the new legislation will ensure that we can still deliver through what appears to be a section 106 agreement that is somewhat narrowed in scope?</p>

<p> Let me ask you another question. A lot of us are concerned about how the twin objectives of this new process can be reconciled. One objective is to get things done quicker. After all, we have most of the industrial support for this Bill because we faff around for too long getting planning permission in Britain compared with other countries and it damages national competitiveness. At the same time, the Government have said very clearly that everybody who wants a say has got to have a say. You have just heard the Local Government Association saying that the new planning process should be more, not less, responsive to the views of local people.</p>
<p>You are the ones who go out there and sit and listen to various representations. If you were writing the guidance for this body, how would you ensure that those two things were reconciled? What do you mean by the voice of the public and that everybody who wants to be heard should be heard?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Katrine Sporle:  </span> I am going to hand over to my colleague. The thing that we need to be clear about is that the experience of the Planning Inspectorate and the inspectors to date is that we have been able to significantly improve on the processes and that we are able to more proactively manage inquiries. We are able to hear evidence in different ways at different times, as appropriate for the appeal that is being looked at. We have speeded up quite considerably the examinations in &nbsp;public when it comes to core strategies under the local development framework proposals. The Bill is building on the experiences of inspectors being able to proactively manage in the way that has been discussed.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Leonora Rozee:  </span> The important thing is to start from first principles. The proposals for the IPC include a wide range of both pre-application and post-application processes. One should not simply restrict oneself to looking at the inquiry. The expertise of the Planning Inspectorate has been in managing major inquiries, which is part of that decision-making process. The IPC proposals are a much wider process because they involve some proposals particularly around the application and pre-application process. For example, in response to comments made by Jacqui Lait, if I may refer to that, there is a clause that requires the applicant, under a duty to consult, to carry out consultation processes. One of the things that the commission can do is to give guidance on the extent of the consultation that is required to ensure that you start off by flushing out the issues that will be of concern to local people. This is not an assumption that by consulting you get consensus, but that on the basis of consulting it is clear to the community exactly what is being proposed.</p>
<p>Once the application has been brought to the commission, it has a range of different mechanisms by which that application can then be considered. Early procedural meetings and early discussions with parties to try to flush out what the issues are that need to be tested and explored are very much part of an inquisitorial process. The inquisitorial process does not simply mean the commissioners sitting in a room like this and asking questions of people sitting around the table. It is a much more involved process. It is about how you get to the point of the application and the identification of what the issues may be once it is being examined&mdash;flushing them out early and allowing people to exchange views through the early exchange of written representations to draw out the issues. Then the commissioners with their expertise test and explore and, as the Bill allows, offer the opportunity for cross-examination as and when it is necessary and appropriate. All of this is allowed for in the Bill.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Leonora Rozee:  </span> They are certainly not there to provide a barrier between the decision maker and the constituent. They are designed to avoid the constituent getting to the inquiry process with inadequate knowledge and understanding of what the commission is seeking to do. I had a good example of this in an &nbsp;inquiry that I held some years ago where there was a great deal of opposition. I held an open-floor session, much as is proposed here, and as a result the local community had a much better understanding of what the proposal was. Had that been done before the application was submitted, many of the fears of that local community would have been addressed through their ability to discuss with the promoters exactly what was proposed. Clearly there still needs to be an opportunity for people to see the decision maker as and when that is necessary, which is provided for through the open-floor session.</p>
<p>In response to your point about the 10,000 people, again our experience is that with careful management you can often narrow that number down to spokespeople who are prepared to come together and agree that out of your 10,000 a smaller number of spokespeople will be putting the points.</p>

<p> I have listened closely to all the points that you have been making.

I have been a civil servant and I know the position you are in. However, you might like to comment on how effective your current powers are such as the open-floor system and the speeded-up procedures that have been used under the 2004 Act.

<p><span class="italic">  Katrine Sporle:  </span> There are two points that we should be clear about. The first is that lovely phrase used by Sir Simon Milton: &ldquo;statutory underpinning&rdquo;. There is a need to ensure that everyone understands the process from the start. While there is discretion to do much of what Leonora has described at the moment, the new Bill provides that statutory underpinning. The other issue is that, as I said at the beginning, the planning inspectorate is there to work on behalf of&mdash;and, for transferred appeals, to stand in the shoes of&mdash;the Secretary of State. We are not independent decision takers, and the IPC is about decision making independent of Government.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Katrine Sporle:  </span> The planning inspectorate has evolved procedures over time, and a number of the procedures that we use are more akin to an inquisitorial process, for example, the hearings that we hold. About 19 per cent. of our cases are done by hearing. The examination processes that have been evolved for the development plan&mdash;both regional special strategies and development plan documents&mdash;are based on an inquisitorial process. The 2005 legislation on town and country planning, which only relates to planning proposals and not to most of the proposals covered by the Bill, is still based primarily on an adversarial process. Stansted G1 was done within the spirit of the 2005 rules, and involved more inquisitorial-type procedures. Planning inspectors certainly have the expertise to operate within an adversarial and, indeed, a more inquisitorial type of process.</p>

<p> You were answering the question about whether you could take on the work of dealing with this handful of major infrastructure projects. You said, essentially, that your role was different in that you have the Secretary of State above you. You are effectively making recommendations, and ultimately it is the Secretary of State&rsquo;s decision on the matters that you deal with. Do you ever suggest to Ministers or to senior civil servants that you could have a specialist wing of your inspectorate which would take on this responsibility with no Secretary of State standing above you?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Katrine Sporle:  </span> We have obviously had very wide-ranging discussions. I should correct myself slightly so as to not give the impression that the only distinction is the independence of decision making. The Bill provides also for the development of the planning application in its early stages, which we currently do not do. With DCLG, we have looked at the model that is currently in force at An Bord Pleanala, the Irish equivalent of the planning inspectorate. An Bord Pleanala, however, is already an independent body, and therefore had an extra wing put on to it to deal with this kind of major infrastructure proposal. It was, I suggest, an easier step than putting a wing on to the planning inspectorate.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Katrine Sporle:  </span> In factual terms, the 2005 rules have not yet been used in full. They will be used for Stansted G2, for which the planning application is currently under development. Stansted G1 was, however, done under the spirit of those rules. It is important to remember that those rules only apply to proposals under town and country planning legislation.

<p> Finally, I want to ask you about the consumer infrastructure levy. Concerns have been expressed about the problems that might occur if the levy is levied at too high a level by the developer. It could stop a developer full-stop, and there is no effective right of appeal in the proposals, as they stand, if the development scheme comes to a stop because of that. The British Property Federation, which we will come to later with the House Builders Federation, will propose some sort of right appeal against the level of the levy. Have you given any consideration to that and how it might operate as far as the inspector is concerned?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Leonora Rozee:  </span> In relation to a right of appeal, one would need to go back to the process by which the levy was initially produced, or defined. I am aware that the &nbsp;precise details of that process and the precise consultation arrangements for identifying what the levy should be are still under discussion.</p>
<p>If you get the right sort of consultation arrangements for the definition of the levy in the first place, the issue of whether that levy is too high should not arise. It may well be much like current policy&mdash;for example, with affordable housing&mdash;in which one issue can be the viability of the development at a certain level of provision. Sometimes, there is a negotiation between the parties, whether it be the local authority and the developer or, ultimately, through an appeal process, to decide whether there may be an exception to a policy to allow a development to proceed because that development should proceed in the public interest, without necessarily making the contribution that is expected by the policy. I shall put that in simple terms, as it sounded unbelievably complicated. If you have a CIL, the viability of which was prejudiced in a particular development, but there were other public interest reasons why that development should go ahead, one could, conceivably, allow that development as an exception to that policy.</p>

<p> A few minutes ago, Ms Sporle mentioned that it was very important that people come to understand the new processes. Part of that process will involve a potential developer/promoter having to take on board the views of those who oppose his or her application. How confident are we that that developer will act in good faith and pass on the views properly articulated in the process? It seems to me that there is a basic conflict of interest between a developer and/or third-party and/or person affected who might object to a development. How confident are we that that developer will relay those feelings adequately? Let me short-circuit my question with these comments. I am sure that other Members present have had a similar experience: as a group, the mobile phone industry is not exactly clean in this regard, and I wonder whether commercial interests will outweigh the need to be perfectly honest and straightforward in the process.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Leonora Rozee:  </span> I think that the best way to answer that is to say that where there are disputes&mdash;it is necessary to hear disputes such as those we hear currently on appeal, which may well affect telecommunications or wind farms&mdash;the process must be robust and the evidence that is being examined must be robustly tested. The way to do that is to be inquisitorial if you do not think that all the issues have come to the table, and/or to allow cross-examination and/or to ensure that people can be heard. Whichever is appropriate, it is the process that must allow for robust testing, so that in the event that any party has been economical with the truth or whatever, it can be exposed. That is the purpose of a robust testing of evidence at cross-examination, whether at a hearing, an inquiry or an independent examination.</p>

<p> I agree. We have all seen situations in which 200 similar letters arrive saying effectively the same thing and they should be properly filtered out fairly quickly. However, my concern is about the new process in the Bill. Let us suppose that the promoter is less than honest in how he or she might put forward the objections to the development, that it goes further and that the commissioner says, &ldquo;I am not allowing any cross-examination here.&rdquo; My concern is that it could undermine the whole process for the person out there who might be affected.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Leonora Rozee:  </span> First, I want to refer to the Bill and to the various duties that have been placed on promoters. Under clause 42, headed &ldquo;Duty to consult local community&rdquo;, the proponent would first have to identify how it is going to be done, and then do it. Secondly, the commission would have the power to reject an application if it did not consider that the promoter had carried out proper consultation. A further safeguard is the role of the local authority, because it is one of the parties that has to be consulted. The local authority would have a role in representing the views of its community and should draw the commission&rsquo;s attention to any inadequacies that it became aware in the consultation processes.</p>
<p>There are a number of safeguards built into the Bill that do not currently exist; there are no similar provisions in the planning legislation that relates to duties on the proponents of schemes. There are all sorts of duties on local authorities but those duties are expressly about making sure that the proponents of a scheme do the work that they should do before it ever comes to the commission. There are a lot of safeguards built in there.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Katrine Sporle:  </span> The very straightforward answer to that last question is no. We are experiencing no inspectors getting on their bikes at all. I repeat what I said to you earlier: we are not in competition with local authorities and we would not be in competition with an independent planning commission. Each of us has different jobs to do. In working in partnership with the Department for Communities and Local Government we have always said that we see ourselves as having a role to play in being able to work with the IPC, particularly on the training and skilling of inspectors, either to provide an inquiry service or to go on to become commissioners in the future. There is no competition between the two bodies.</p>

<p> That is why the Irish system recruits from among planning inspectors.</p>
<p>My final point is that you have emphasised on a number of occasions the importance of striking a balance in the way that you conduct hearings&mdash;Ms Rozee, in particular&mdash;to ensure that there is fairness as well as efficiency. What would you say is the key thing? Does that sometimes involve allowing cross-examination, where appropriate, and I suppose sometimes limiting the cross-examination when it is going to get out of hand?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Leonora Rozee:  </span> Absolutely. Certainly the 2005 rules under the Town and Country Planning Act make it clear that there should be appropriate controls exercised over cross-examination. My own view is that the principle of a process that is primarily inquisitorial is the right principle with the appropriate safeguards that are built into the Bill and where, if necessary, questioning by opposing parties is an appropriate process.</p>
<p>It may be useful for the Committee to know that we have now been having discussions for three years or so with the planning Bar about how to make the procedures in both inquiries and examinations in public much more effective without going back into the adversarial processes. Those can be built upon for the IPC, so that you do provide these safeguards.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Katrine Sporle:  </span> That is an interesting question, because we have a small number of specially skilled inspectors who deal with the major projects and that probably does not impact on the resource and the work load issues of the Planning Inspectorate as a whole. The 23,000 appeals that we deal with annually are, by and large, town and country planning appeals, as opposed to those major cases that come mainly through other Government Departments, including those dealing with energy and roads. So I do not see there being a big issue in terms of loss of work to the Planning Inspectorate.</p>
<p>We need to be clear that the inspectorate&rsquo;s workload has risen by nearly 50 per cent. over a five-year period, so there is an issue about whether it is appropriate for inspectors to be dealing at national level with something that is obviously a very local issue of local importance. In the meantime, we have made a clear case for what we have called fast-tracking householder appeals. So, for the first time, we are seeking to be clear that different types of appeal should have a slightly different process that is more proportionate, more cost-effective and much more customer-oriented.</p>
<p>We are clear that we have a lot of work to do on householder appeals to give better customer service to householders and that, if there are local member review bodies in future, that streamlined process should be the one passed on to those bodies.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Slaughter:  </span> On behalf of the Home Builders Federation, we want at a high level to welcome the Bill, which we think is helpful in a broad sense for the major housing issues that we face as a country, to both increase supply and, from our perspective, meet the extremely challenging objective of building to a zero-carbon standard from 2016 onwards. The general objectives of the Bill are helpful in that respect, and we support the objective of improving the speed, efficiency and effectiveness of decision making on national infrastructure because that will be broadly helpful with regard to spatial planning in achieving housing objectives as well.</p>
<p>We particularly welcome the fact that we are going to have a process for developing legitimate, properly consulted-on national policy statements. However, from our perspective there are two main areas on which we want to focus today. First, it is perhaps useful to say for the benefit of the Committee that the community infrastructure levy in many ways reflects comments that we made to the Government in the run up to the preparation of the Bill about the best approach to be taken to achieve a suitable contribution from development towards infrastructure requirements to support that development.</p>
<p>We are particularly keen on the fact that this is based on a localised approach that we believe will help to produce a positive climate for development and a sense of discussion among the partners. There are, however, a number of material points that we would like to raise about it, so I shall hand over to Stephen in a second. Briefly, we would like to say that the aspects of the Bill that relate to the town and country planning system are &nbsp;also very important from our point of view, and there are a number of issues there that we would like to go into if we have time.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Ashworth:  </span> The British Property Federation welcomes the Planning Bill as a whole and the efforts that it is making to speed up the planning system. We particularly welcome the proposals on national policy statements and hope that that will achieve the swifter delivery of major infrastructure schemes and assist the development of major infrastructure projects that are necessary to support development, which is the life blood of the British Property Federation&rsquo;s membership. We have concentrated in our memorandum and in our comments to the Committee on the community infrastructure levy. We support it in general terms, but with four key points. First, we believe that it must be locally based. Secondly, it can be locally based by ensuring that it comes through the local development framework system, and we would look for clarity in the Bill to be sure that that is the case. Thirdly, we would ensure that it was dealt with alongside and as part of a planning application process. That is a well-tried, tested and trusted mechanism, so that appeal mechanisms of the sort that you discussed with the Planning Inspectorate can be used to resolve final issues about the incidence of the levy. Finally, some clauses in the Bill refer to the infrastructure levy being dealt with on the basis of increases in value. We think that those are slightly misleading in the way that they approach the infrastructure levy, and we would look for those provisions to be removed.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Slaughter:  </span> The short answer is that it will not put anything on the price because the housing market is driven by what the market price is at any particular time.

<p> Let me clear about this. It is going to be a roof tax&mdash;it has been christened a roof tax&mdash;and the developers will pay it as a contribution to the infrastructure that, according to your memo, you might wish to deliver. Are you saying that it will have no impact at all on the price that you will charge for properties?</p>

The sale of new houses is a maximum of 10 per cent. of the residential property market at any given time. In selling our homes, we are not in a position to influence that general price level.

<p><span class="italic">  John Slaughter:  </span> Perhaps we could ask Andrew to comment on that, because he probably has more detailed knowledge. One makes an analogy with some of the current situations where we have roof taxes.

<p><span class="italic">  Andrew Whitaker:  </span> I think John&rsquo;s answer is correct. The Milton Keynes roof tax, as it is called, is &#163;18,000 per roof, but it is applied in a particular way with a particular formula that suits the infrastructure being provided for the level of development taking place at Milton Keynes. I am not suggesting that you could pick up that calculation and put it in Ripon. Ripon will need to undertake its own calculation, based on its land values, the level of development and its own infrastructure needs. It will have to discuss that with the development industry.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Andrew Whitaker:  </span> Under that system, you would produce an infrastructure plan, which local authorities are obliged to do in any event. They would then cost that infrastructure plan and find out where else they &nbsp;were going to get contributions from. As you rightly say, the CIL is not there as a substitute for funding from other sources, but in addition to them. Therefore, they would take that away from the amount of infrastructure that they require. That gives them a residual amount. They would then need to make an assessment of whether that residual amount is affordable within the local market. If it is not, something has got to give. We have to prioritise; otherwise you will get no development because no one will be able to afford to develop.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Ashworth:  </span> Perhaps I can assist by giving two practical examples. The first is in connection with the emerging Kent Thameside town where there is a charge for transport infrastructure of about &#163;5,000 per house. That has quite a long history and pedigree behind it because a need has been identified for a transport infrastructure to serve Kent Thameside, with a bill of about &#163;160 million. That has gone to the DCLG and the Highways Agency, saying that they have to make a significant contribution, leaving a balance that is being looked for from the development community and other sources, including existing sources of public funding.</p>
<p>After consultation with the development community, landowners in the area and other public agencies, a view is being taken about what is generally affordable. That is a relatively subjective exercise and there is a lot of debate about whether it should be &#163;3,000, &#163;4,000, &#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000. That debate is now playing out in a supplementary planning document that is being promoted by each of the local authorities in the area. They are listening to the consultation and I suspect that over the next two or three months they will reach a conclusion about the level of the charge. In the meantime&mdash;this is quite an important transitionary point for the Bill as a whole&mdash;a number of developers have already started paying at the level of &#163;5,000 per house. Land Securities has signed an agreement that will make a &#163;40 million contribution to that infrastructure.</p>

<p> It is fair to say that the proposal for a planning charge that you put forward as organisations was borne out of your resistance to the planning gains supplement, which was resisted on the grounds of complications over trying to assess increases in value. Is that why you are now getting alarmed at the use of the word &ldquo;value&rdquo; in clause 166 as one of the possible methods of calculating what the infrastructure levy might be? Is this a fundamental stumbling block for you in terms of your support for what the Government are putting forward?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Rhodes:  </span> I am not sure that we think it a fundamental stumbling block. We just think that it is a mistake. It is clear that the Government have abandoned &nbsp;the planning gains supplement, which as you say was based on two calculations of value for every development in the country. Calculations of value are complex and subject to a lot of disagreement. We thought that that process was fundamentally flawed in its application.</p>
<p>The process that the Government have announced is similar to the one that we promoted. Instead of being based on value, it is based on an assessment of infrastructure needs and their affordability across a local authority area. We were therefore surprised to see reference to value in the Bill. Affordability and viability are important. We have just had a short debate about that, but that is very different from saying that the CIL is based on securing a certain proportion of value; it is not. It is based on assessing the requirements for infrastructure in an area, seeing what element of that needs to be raised from the development that is planned and sharing that cost against development. There are references to value in the Bill that we think are unhelpful. Among our members and others in the property industry, that has caused concern that the planning gains supplement is not dead.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Slaughter:  </span> Maybe I can add to that. The key question is workability and the concern about references to changes in land value in relation to planning gain supplement&mdash;it was, as much as anything, that a lot of experts looked at it and found that it would be very hard to operate in practice. The issues about PGS were much wider than that.</p>
<p>One of the other key aspects that we were collectively concerned about, as developers, was the weakening of the link between development and the local provision of infrastructure. We particularly want to stress today the value of the levy from the point of view of hopefully strengthening that local connection, having a proper assessment and buy-in to what is needed to support development in an area, and, as a result of that, making more things happen rather than less. But it is critical technically that the basis on which the levy is assessed stems, as we have said, initially from the identification of needs according to a legitimate process, and then one works towards viability. We are concerned that the references in the Bill to value may, at best, be confusing and, at worst, could introduce complications into the process. We would like a clearer understanding of how the mechanism of setting the community infrastructure levy would work in practice. It is important, from our point of view, that we get that emphasis right in the enabling provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p> May I just lead on to some references you have made to the relationship between the levy and section 10, which will still be around? You referred, in paragraph 2.11 of your submission, to the fact that we ought to be able to define one set of infrastructure demands, which will be done under section 106, and another that would be done under the levy, and that there should not be a &ldquo;creep&rdquo; between the two. Is that not realistically impossible? There will be the odd bit of road linking a development to a major highway, which might well be pertinent to section 106, as being very specifically part of that scheme, but there will be a need for a wider contribution from a number of &nbsp;developments to other more significant transport improvements that are necessary because of the general development of an area.</p>
<p>Also, you go on in paragraph 2.13 to state that developers might elect to have elements of the infrastructure provided through section 106 and that that should be offset against the CIL, then in paragraph 2.19 you discuss the fact that the CIL might simplify arrangements because it would mean that there would be less need for agreements under section 106. Is there not some confusion in what you are saying there?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Ashworth:  </span> The question comes in three separate parts. There is a question about whether a bright, shining line can be drawn between infrastructure that will be subject to the CIL and infrastructure that will be dealt with under site-specific agreement. You are right if you are treating it as an absolute question. There will always be a blurred boundary. We think that that can be dealt with in a number of ways. If the nature of infrastructure that can be subject to CIL is identified in the Act, as it goes forward, that makes very clear what a subsequent section 106 agreement cannot comprise, so you start to get a demarcation between the two which is able to be policed.</p>
<p>You then move on to the question of offsetting. Offsetting works in practice; that is the simple response to that. In Milton Keynes, with each of the agreements that has gone forward on a site-specific basis, the developers have said, &ldquo;We will deliver that piece of infrastructure. This is the cost of delivering it and we will set it off against our future payments of tariff.&rdquo; Identical arrangements are working in the London Thames Gateway, for example. So offsetting for identified pieces of infrastructure that have been costed does work in practice.</p>
<p>In relation to simplifying it: yes, absolutely you can simplify it, because if there is a CIL requirement, a condition imposed from planning consent that says, &ldquo;Pay x before you build&rdquo; is very easy and simple to police and it will avoid a lot of the issues that arise in negotiations at the moment. It does, I accept, get more complex if the developer is delivering some pieces of infrastructure, but I promise you that it will be far simpler to deal with that, and has been far easier to do so in Milton Keynes in the context of the simple offset provisions, when you compare it with the sort of approach that is adopted in the normal negotiated planning agreement.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Ashworth:  </span> That is why I mentioned the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation, which is, I suspect, at the other end of the range that people will be looking at. It is largely a deprived urban area with significant elements of brownfield land, where it has gone through the exercise that was discussed earlier of looking at the infrastructure costs. Those costs were between &#163;25,000 and &#163;30,000. It recognised that that amount could not be charged for &nbsp;each of the areas within it, and said that it would have to discount it to &#163;6,000 and &#163;10,000. Even with that sort of mechanism, there are still provisions for offset that it is willing to accept.</p>

We have focused primarily on our own sphere of interest, and that would broadly cover our own sphere of interest. We are aware that there is potentially a debate about where to draw the line. One way of looking at it might be to work back&mdash;we have discussed the desirability, if we can do it, and there are challenges in doing it&mdash;and identify a sensible list of what would be financed by a community infrastructure levy. On the whole, one might reasonably expect that entities or developments that feature that kind of infrastructure provision would not necessarily contribute to the levy. The honest answer is that discussion about this process is still in play. We clearly see the levy as applying to our members, but we do not necessarily have a clear-cut view on where one draws the line beyond that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Rhodes:  </span> I expect that the levy, in practice, is likely to be paid by the developer. It is associated with the grant of planning permission being secured through a condition or a standard section 106 agreement. One advantage of developing the levy through the LDF process, and one advantage relative to PGS, is that it would be relatively straightforward to work out your likely liability to CIL before you go through the planning process, or even before you buy the land if you are the developer. On that basis, while the cheque might be written by the developer, the cost is likely to be passed through to the land with a reduced land acquisition cost.</p>

I think that Mr. Rhodes&rsquo;s answer deals adequately with the point. If it does not, you need to expand slightly on what it is that you are getting at. I do not see that it makes any difference whether one builds leasehold or freehold properties. A development that has planning consent is liable for a CIL payment, just as it would be at the moment if a section 106 contribution had been agreed. How it is paid for&mdash;where the value comes from or where it is derived from&mdash;is up to the developer, who will have to come to some deal with the landowner about where it will come from. There are only two ways that we make money in land development. One is land value, and the other is development profit. We will continue to make development profit.

<p><span class="italic">  Andrew Whitaker:  </span> It is a concern for us that that could be the case. That is why we require pragmatism in the process of setting the levy. If you set it too high, you will stifle development. Do not forget that we are already paying large amounts of money under section 106. The whole point of CIL is to take away some of that obligation under section 106, although we think that overall CIL will be able to raise more money than we currently get under section 106 because it will apply to more schemes, not because it will raise more on each individual scheme. We see that as an offset. Do not forget that we are not starting from a blank sheet of paper. Most development schemes&mdash;certainly those of any size&mdash;pay money under section 106 and make contributions under section 106.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Slaughter:  </span> I am tempted to make a slightly philosophical point, but I hope that it is not unhelpful. If you go back to what we like about the community infrastructure levy&mdash;it will hopefully create a better climate for development locally&mdash;the danger of these conversations is that we always look at the situation as a zero-sum game. Half of the approach is really about getting out of that and incentivising more development by creating a sensible process whereby local communities can see the value that will be provided, and one can have a sensible conversation about how to achieve that.</p>
<p>If we get into that positive circle, I am not sure that your premise will be the case. If we achieve that great magic circle trick&mdash;a trick in some senses; it is nevertheless a real objective to aim at&mdash;we can achieve more all around. It would create more development, it would not over-affect land values and it would make a necessary contribution to local needs. We must be careful not to look at it too rigidly.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Andrew Whitaker:  </span> We have been discussing with various groups&mdash;both groups in the Home Builders Federation and joint groups with the British Property Federation&mdash;the formula that might be used. It seems obviously inequitable to charge the same for a one-bedroomed flat as for a four or five-bedroomed detached house. Those discussions are going on at the moment, and I am afraid that we have not got to a conclusion. It seems perfectly obvious to have a different levy, but we have not worked out how to calculate it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Slaughter:  </span> That takes you back to the process that we want to see, which involves a proper local discussion and examination through adopting a proper plan on infrastructure provisions and setting the levy as part of the local development framework. The answer &nbsp;is whatever it should be. If the local authority&rsquo;s objective is to encourage a particular type of development in terms of what the local community needs, that may be the right answer, but we certainly would not support that as the general approach. Again, that is why, in our memorandum, we were keen to pick up particular points reinforcing a sensible process to get the levy right. But it needs to vary from area to area, according to an area&rsquo;s particular requirements.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Andrew Whitaker:  </span> And do not forget&mdash;I keep stressing this&mdash;that we are not operating in a vacuum. The town and country planning system is very complex, as you all know. There are lots of other policy drivers within that system, not least the need for affordable housing and its provision through planning agreement. I was interested in the &ldquo;buy one, get one free&rdquo; comment, because that is what it feels like when providing housing. Under a 50 per cent. requirement for affordable housing, you are indeed building one and getting one free. The policy requirement for affordable housing will remain. Indeed, the industry is currently being berated for building too many small units and not providing enough affordable houses or larger-type units. This environment of strategic housing market assessment, strategic housing land availability assessment, the local development framework and the local development documents is still there and still forms the basis of the policy stance against which we should be assessing all these things.</p>
<p>We are trying, via CIL, to provide a much more efficient, transparent and quick methodology for making the contributions that we are already making under section 106 agreements, but because that system is complex it takes a long time and we have to repeat a lot of work, time after time, and we are trying to simplify that process. It is not as if we are operating in a vacuum.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Ashworth:  </span> I am happy to add to that. One of the clauses that is potentially missing from the Bill is one dealing with the delivery of infrastructure. There is a useful provision that makes it quite clear that the levy that is raised must be applied to certain infrastructure, but there is no mechanism for ensuring that the multiple bodies that are required to deliver infrastructure co-operate in delivering the infrastructure for which payment is being made. Trying to ensure that the health trusts, education authorities and everybody else delivers the infrastructure in accordance with the infrastructure plan is a missing element of the Bill.</p>
<p>To date, developers have been willing to sign up and make payments on the basis of promises from the local authorities&mdash;from the Milton Keynes Partnership, for example&mdash;that the infrastructure will be provided. To a large extent, they have taken a leap of faith in relation to that because all that they are getting back at the moment are reasonable-endeavours obligations to deliver infrastructure. At the moment, there is trust that that infrastructure will be delivered. The next few years are critical to make sure that that trust is repaid.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Rhodes:  </span> There are two issues. You have heard us say that we are keen that this should operate through the LDF process. Draft PPS 12, which is out to consultation, already goes quite a long way to explaining that a local authority will have to produce an infrastructure plan and a delivery plan that goes with that. The LDF will not be regarded as sound and capable of being adopted unless there is a delivery plan that persuades the inspector conducting the examination, whose recommendations are binding on the planning authority, that if the money is raised through the CIL policies it will be spent. For that and lots of other reasons, we regard the LDF process as a protection whereby we will not be paying money that simply sits in a bank account.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Rhodes:  </span> Yes, that would be an easy way to approach it. We have not promoted that. What we have promoted are changes to the clauses that make it clear how the system is intended to work. So, the deletion of reference to &ldquo;value&rdquo; was important, but even more important to us than that is ensuring that the clauses take the opportunity, which they do not at the moment, to explain that this is going to operate through the planning system. There are three specific clauses&mdash;163, 166 and 167&mdash;where the option could be taken to say CIL will be raised through the LDF process. We do not understand why that is not in the Bill at the moment. It is the only sensible way in which local communities can engage in this, in which the property industry can have confidence that the CIL is going to be properly raised, and in which there is independent examination.</p>
<p>Through the LDF process you would create CIL policies. You will then have a planning system that creates a presumption in favour of any policies in the plan, and we have an application process and an appeal process already in place, through the planning system, in which the industry has confidence. As long as that is the way in which CIL is intended to be developed, then we are happy to contribute our views to try and make &nbsp;that work as best we can. In so far as there is any residual concern that it may be a different system, then we do have concerns. For instance, there are two references in the clauses to an appeals process being established for CIL. We would like to see those deleted from the Bill. We do not understand the need for a separate appeals process. There is a more than adequate planning appeals process already in existence.</p>

<p> The last point that you make on this issue in your submission is about the right of appeal. You are almost proposing a separate right of appeal, if there is a concern about the viability of a project because of the amount of the levy that is going to be charged. I have just asked the people from the Planning Inspectorate whether they believed that that could be subsumed into the normal planning process and be a matter for an appeal that could be taken in the normal course of events. Would you be satisfied with that or do you still have real concerns over this issue?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Rhodes:  </span> I think that we may not have explained ourselves properly if you have got an impression that we are seeking a separate appeals process. We are looking for CIL to be embedded in the LDFs, so that there is a policy that requires the CIL to be paid. Planning application is then made, and lots of considerations are taken into account, but it may be that in certain cases a developer argues that he cannot afford to pay CIL. The local authority may take the view that that is then contrary to the LDF. Planning permission is refused and there is an appeals process to the Planning Inspectorate&mdash;the existing appeals process&mdash;which allows an appeal to be considered on the basis, which, as Leonara Rozee, I think, confirmed, works in exactly the same way in relation to social housing policies. The developer makes an argument that he cannot afford to meet the full requirement for affordable housing. Planning consent could be refused on that basis, if the planning authority is not convinced. That decision can then be appealed to the Planning Inspectorate. It is a simple, straightforward planning appeal. The Planning Inspectorate then has to ask itself a question: are the merits of this development, without sufficient affordable housing to meet the policies, sufficient to outweigh the objection that there is not enough affordable housing in accordance with the policy, should planning consent be granted? We think that CIL can operate in exactly the same way. If it becomes a policy of the development plan, it can be dealt with through the planning appeals process.</p>

<p> You may have partly answered this question. You will be aware that the Government recently identified the need to build thousands of houses, particularly affordable houses, throughout various parts of the UK, especially for first-time buyers. Can I therefore ask whether there is any tangible evidence that, if this levy is implemented, it will impact in any way on the ambitious plan that the Government have for building significant numbers of new homes?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  John Slaughter:  </span> I probably need to come back to the point I made a few minutes ago about avoiding the zero-sum game view of this. It is undoubtedly true that, when you look at this in the round, what local &nbsp;authorities will need to do&mdash;and they will be in the driving seat in terms of delivering all this in practice&mdash;is balance the need for affordable housing in the local area against other requirements. One needs to look at that in a rounded sense. There is no point in having a discussion about the levy without looking at its interaction with affordable housing provision. We do not see any direct trade-off between the two, but you need to have a sensible overall approach to consider these issues in relation to each other. If we hold to the thought that this is about achieving more, rather than less, then I do not see why that should be a concern, because the end result of this proposal from our point of view is that it &nbsp;will play its part in delivering more housing. Our concerns about PGS were, in part, that it might discourage more housing by discouraging land supply. With CIL, it is the other way round. This is a positive incentive if we set it up right, and we should therefore get more of everything as a result.</p>
