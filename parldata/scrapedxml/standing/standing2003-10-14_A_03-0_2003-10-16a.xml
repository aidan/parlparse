<p> (5) The notice requirements are the requirements under sections 11 and 12 to publish, affix and serve notices in connection with the compulsory purchase order. </p>
<p> (6) A relevant objection is an objection by a person who is a qualifying person for the purposes of section 12(2), but if such a person qualifies only by virtue of section 12(2A)(b) and the confirming authority thinks that he is not likely to be entitled to make a relevant claim his objection is not a relevant objection. </p>
<p> (7) Disregarded means disregarded under subsection (4) or under any other power to disregard a relevant objection contained in the enactment providing for the compulsory purchase. </p>
<p> 13A Confirmation of order: remaining objections </p>

<p> (a) withdrawn, nor </p>
<p> (b) disregarded, </p>
<p> (a remaining objection). </p>
<p> (2) The confirming authority may proceed under the written representations procedure&mdash; </p>

<p> (c) if every person who has made a remaining objection consents in the prescribed manner. </p>
<p> (3) If subsection (2) does not apply or if the confirming authority decides not to proceed under that subsection, it must either&mdash; </p>

<p> (5) The confirming authority may confirm the order with or without modifications if it has considered the objection and either&mdash; </p>
<p> (a) it has followed the written representations procedure, or </p>
<p> (b) in a case which falls within subsection (3), if an inquiry was held or a person was appointed under subsection (3)(b), it has considered the report of the person who held the inquiry or who was so appointed. </p>

<p> (a) every person who has made a remaining objection, </p>
<p> (b) the acquiring authority, and </p>
<p> (c) any other person the confirming authority thinks appropriate, </p>

<p> (3) An order under subsection (2) may be made a rule of the High Court on the application of any party named in the order. </p>
<p> (4) The costs incurred by the confirming authority in connection with the written representations procedure must be paid by the acquiring authority, if the confirming authority so directs. </p>
<p> (5) The confirming authority may certify the amount of its costs, and any amount so certified and directed to be paid by the acquiring authority is recoverable summarily by the confirming authority as a civil debt. </p>
<p> (6) Section 42(2) of the Housing and Planning Act 1986 (recovery of Minister's costs in connection with inquiries) applies to the written representations procedure as if the procedure is an inquiry specified in section 42(1) of that Act. </p>
<p> (7) Regulations under section 13A(6) may make provision as to the giving of reasons for decisions taken in cases where the written representations procedure is followed. </p>
<p> 13C Confirmation in stages </p>
<p> (1) The confirming authority may confirm an order (with or without modifications) so far as it relates to part of the land comprised in the order (the ''relevant part'') if each of the conditions in subsection (2) is met. </p>
<p> (2) The conditions are&mdash; </p>
<p> (a) the confirming authority is satisfied that the order ought to be confirmed so far as it relates to the relevant part but has not for the time being determined whether the order ought to be confirmed so far as it relates to the remaining part; </p>
<p> (b) the confirming authority is satisfied that the notice requirements have been complied with. </p>
<p> (3) If there is a remaining objection in respect of the order, the confirming authority may only act under subsection (1) after complying with section 13A(2) or (3) (as the case may be). </p>

<p> (5) If the confirming authority acts under subsection (1)&mdash; </p>
<p> (a) it must give a direction postponing consideration of the order, so far as it relates to the remaining part, until such time as may be specified by or under the direction, </p>
<p> (b) the order so far as it relates to each part of the land must be treated as a separate order. </p>
<p> (6) The notices to be published, affixed and served under section 15 must include a statement as to the effect of the direction given under subsection (5)(a). </p>
<p> (7) Notice requirements must be construed in accordance with section 13. </p>
<p> (8) Remaining objection must be construed in accordance with section 13A.'' </p>

<p> (4) A confirmation notice is a notice&mdash; </p>
<p> (a) describing the land; </p>
<p> (b) stating that the order has been confirmed; </p>

<p> (5) A confirmation notice must be in the prescribed form.'' </p>

<p> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.The Chairman: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:</p>
<p> Government new clause 19&mdash;Procedure for authorisation of compulsory purchase by a Minister. </p>
<p> Government amendments Nos. 56 and 58 to 72. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.4.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" time="9:10" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s02.htm" colnum="82">
<p> May I set out the purposes of new clauses 18 and 19? New clause 18 recasts the existing procedure for the making and confirmation of compulsory purchase orders for non-ministerial acquiring authorities. Such authorities include local authorities, regional development agencies and English Partnerships. The decision whether to confirm such orders is currently made by the relevant Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales, and they are known as the confirming authorities.</p>
<p> New clause 19 deals with orders for the acquisition of land by Ministers, such as by the Secretary of State for Transport on behalf of the Highways Agency, or the National Assembly for Wales. The procedures for both are similar, but the terminology is different, so parallel clauses are required to achieve our intention. </p>
<p> New clauses 18 and 19 introduce three major changes. First, they will extend the groups of people who have a right to have their objections heard; secondly, they will introduce a written procedure; and thirdly, they will enable compulsory purchase orders to be determined in stages. I shall take each point in turn. </p>
<p> The extension of the category of persons who have a right have their objections heard to confirmation of a compulsory purchase order will create a fairer system. The right to appear at a public local inquiry or hearing to argue a case in front of an inspector is currently limited to owners, lessees or occupiers other than tenants who are contracted for a month or less. At present, tenants for a month or less have no such right, despite the fact that such tenants may have been in occupation for many years. They are typically tenants on short-hold tenancies that have continued after their </p>
<p> fixed term. It seems entirely fair that such persons should have a right to argue their case if they wish to object to a compulsory purchase order. </p>
<p> Another example would be a person who has a right of access across the land to be acquired&mdash;a right that is either to be interfered with or acquired under the acquiring authority's proposals. That right of access may be critical to the person's enjoyment of his land. It is only fair that he should have a right to make representations against confirmation of the order. </p>
<p> The new clauses will extend the category of persons with an interest in or over the land to be acquired who will have a right to object. Essentially, they cover anyone who might be able to claim compensation as a result of the implementation of the order and the scheme for which the order is made. However, given the practical difficulties that acquiring authorities might have in identifying all those with an interest in land, the new clauses do not place an absolute obligation on acquiring authorities to identify them all. For instance, it may be impractical for acquiring authorities to identify those claiming prescriptive rights across land. A person might claim a private right of way across land on the basis of use over many years. Such claims may not be written down or registered, and it may not be obvious to the acquiring authority that such a right exists. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister for the clear way in which she is setting out such a highly complex subject.</p>
<p> I was going to raise this point later, but it seems logical to raise it now. A number of properties up and down the country are empty, or have been abandoned for a period of time, and it may not be easy to ascertain who owns them. What proposals do the Government have to try to identify those who might have an interest in such properties? </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.4.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" time="9:10" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s02.htm" colnum="83">
<p> That is picked up in new clause 20, which we will come to shortly. Obviously, the acquiring authorities must do everything they can to identify all who may have a stake or interest in the matter. However, the purpose of this new clause, and the issue here, is that in cases where there are people whom it would simply not be reasonable to expect the acquiring authority to identify or reach beforehand, we must ensure that the acquiring authority is obliged to fix an appropriate notice on the site, thereby publishing the order on or near the land.</p>
<p> That provision attempts to deal with people who have disputed right of access or who claim to have private right of way across the land, but whose claims may not be obviously apparent to the acquiring authority in the first instant. The acquiring authority will be required to display an appropriate notice at the time of confirmation. The new requirement for site notices is in addition to the current requirements to serve notices on all those whom the acquiring authority has been able to identify as having appropriate interest in the land included in the order and to place statutory notices in local newspapers. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.4.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" time="9:10" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s02.htm" colnum="83">
<p> It is worth pursuing the point one more time: if it is clear that the land has been abandoned, would the acquiring authority be expected</p>
<p> to make inquiries at the Land Registry, where some clue as to who owned the land might well be had?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.4.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" time="9:10" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s02.htm" colnum="84">
<p> Yes, it would. We are certainly not attempting to reduce the acquiring authority's responsibility to do all it can to identify those with an interest in the land subject to the compulsory purchase order; we think that that responsibility is right and proper. The provisions simply recognise that we are extending the category of potential objectors to cover those who may be much more difficult to identify. For that reason we think it right that the authority should have the additional obligation to place a notice on the site, in order to reach those that the acquiring authority might not think it obvious should be included. That is a result of widening the category of people who have a statutory right to object, and that is the purpose of the new clause. We will come to the issue of information in a later new clause.</p>
<p> The people on whom the acquiring authority must serve notice of the making of the order are referred to in proposed new section 12(2)(a) in new clause 18(5) as </p>
<p><span class="indent">''an owner, lessee, tenant (whatever the tenancy period) or occupier of the land, or''</span></p>
<p> someone who ''falls within subsection (2A).'' Subsection 2A covers two categories. The first is anyone whose interest the purchasing authority will have to acquire as part of the CPO, and the second is anyone whom the acquiring authority thinks likely to make a claim for compensation for injurious affection under section 10 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965. That would include, for example, interference with an adjoining owner's property rights, or someone whose right of way over the land was to be interfered with. </p>
<p> Another subject dealt with by this group of amendments is written representations. The introduction of a written representation procedure for the consideration of objections should help to speed up the statutory process. The aim is to make things fairer by making the submission of representations more accessible to unrepresented objectors. At the moment, it is possible in principle for objections to be considered by means of written representations. However, in practice, the use of entirely written representations does not occur. In the absence of a statutory power to prescribe a standard procedure, it has not proved practical to get agreement among all the parties involved on what procedure should be adopted on a case-by-case basis, yet there may be a number of instances where using a written procedure could speed up decision making, and might be less daunting for objectors, and there might be cases in which all parties in the process would prefer a written procedure, if only the details could be agreed. </p>
<p> The new clause enables the Secretary of State to make regulations setting out a procedure by which objections can be considered in writing. We have issued a short paper describing the way in which, subject to consultation, we envisage the written representations process working. That paper is available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister </p>
<p> website, and I believe that it has also been sent to Members. </p>
<p> The written representations procedure will be available only when all those with remaining objections agree to it rather than a public inquiry. It will not apply if an objector insists on a public inquiry or if there are complex circumstances and we think that the need for a public inquiry remains&mdash;for example, when special parliamentary procedure applies, such as with common land or National Trust land, or with operational land involving the acquirement of utilities. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.4.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" time="9:10" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s02.htm" colnum="85">
<p> Perhaps it is easier to deal with matters by intervening, rather than by making points in my opening remarks.</p>
<p> Before we get to the written procedure, I will deal with a point about objections. Objectors may make objections and the confirming authority may confirm the order if certain conditions are satisfied. Under new section 13(2): </p>
<p><span class="indent">''The conditions are&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent"> (a) no relevant objection is made,''</span></p>
<p> but, perhaps more significantly, </p>
<p><span class="indent">''(b) every relevant objection made is either withdrawn or disregarded.''</span></p>
<p> I want to press the Minister a little more on that ''disregarded.'' It seems to me that there is a danger that objections could be disregarded unless an objector has made a full statutory statement of his or her case, with proofs of evidence&mdash;in other words, unless they have presented their full case at that point. I am not sure that that is the intention, but I would be grateful if the Minister clarified that. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.4.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" time="9:10" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s03.htm" colnum="85">
<p> No, it is certainly not the intention to have a back-door way out by using the word ''disregarded''. I would like to come back to the hon. Gentleman on that in my summing up. He has made some important points and I do not want to mislead him or the Committee by trying to respond now. That issue needs to be clarified.</p>
<p> New clause 18 also inserts proposed new section 13B in the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. That gives the confirming authority the power to make orders about the costs of the parties making written representations, including the power to specify which parties must pay the costs. That is analogous to the current provisions relating to public local inquiries into compulsory purchase orders. </p>
<p> As I set out earlier, the third area of change is confirmation in stages. That extends to all types of order the power to confirm orders in stages. It should make it possible for work to start on part of an acquiring authority's scheme where part of an order can be confirmed in advance of the rest. </p>
<p> At present, compulsory purchase orders made under certain specific powers can be confirmed in stages. For example, orders made under section 226(1)(a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 can be confirmed in two stages, and orders under section 259 of the Highways Act 1980 can be </p>
<p> brought into force in an unlimited number of stages, but such staged confirmation is not available for all types of order. Such inconsistency could result in unnecessary delay where there are problems with part of the area covered by a single order, while progress could be made on acquiring the rest of the land and implementing the scheme for which it is needed. </p>
<p> The new clause proposes a general power for compulsory purchase orders to be confirmed in any number of stages if the confirming authority is satisfied that that is the most appropriate course of action. </p>

<p> I confess to having far less knowledge on the matter than my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). Will the Minister please tell me where it is stated who a confirming authority is?</p>

<p> Again, rather than spend the next five minutes trying to find the exact place, I will come back to the hon. Gentleman, if he will allow me.</p>
<p> When the confirming Minister decides that it would be appropriate to confirm the order in part, he must give a direction postponing consideration of the remaining part of the order until a fixed date and stating that the remaining part of the order must be treated as a separate order. The fixed date will be specified in the direction or following it. </p>
<p> New clause 19 sets out very similar structuring of and amendments to the procedure for the preparation in draft, and the making of, compulsory orders for land that a Minister seeks to acquire. </p>

<p> The confirming in stages procedure is of course a new one. If an order for the taking of a property in stages is confirmed it is presumably for the convenience of the acquiring authority, which for some reason does not want to take the whole property at once. In the light of that, can the Minister confirm that if the person whose interest is being acquired incurs extra costs because of the procedure, they will be able to claim those costs, whether as a result of severance, injurious affection or any other way?</p>

<p> Clearly, all issues of compensation have to be dealt with fairly. I cannot specify what the circumstances would be, but all the responses in the process of determining compensation have to go through the proper procedures. If they do not, those people who lose out or are entitled to compensation will have a case.</p>

<p> I will give the Minister a practical example that might help both her and the Committee. Let us suppose that somebody owns a farm, and it is decided that motorway will be put through the middle of that farm. The acquiring authority would hitherto have had to take the whole farm. Now it may acquire land on only one side of the motorway. The farmer will have considerable extra costs as he will have less land on which to operate. For example, if he has a dairy farm he will have far less land and may have to sell cows because he does not have the land to put them on. Therefore he will be involved in considerable cost and disturbance, and I</p>
<p> want the Minister to undertake that such a farmer will be able to claim the costs.</p>

<p> I point out to the hon. Gentleman the fact that the arrangements already exist for certain types of order. It is already possible to carry out safe confirmation for different kinds of order. There must be good reasons involved; it is not simply a matter for the discretion of the acquiring authority. It has to be a matter for the confirming authority to decide, and it must have good reasons. The same approach would apply as does in those areas where it is already possible to confirm in stages. We are simply extending the approach to a wider category of orders, because we think that there will be cases when that makes sense and is appropriate.</p>
<p> Amendments Nos. 56 to 72 are consequential. Amendment No. 60 makes consequential amendments to the Welsh Development Agency Act 1975 and the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. The latter extends to Scotland and it is necessary to extend the Bill to cover Scotland for the purposes of that one provision. That is the effect of amendments Nos. 56 and 57, which amend clause 89 on the territorial extent of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 61 to 64 are consequential to the Highways Act 1980. Amendments Nos. 65 to 68 are consequential to various other enactments as a result of the provisions of new clause 18. Amendments Nos. 69 to 72 are the repeals of existing legislation. </p>
<p> I want to clarify which body will be the confirming authority. The confirming authority will be different for different orders and acquiring authorities, depending on the case. The confirming authority is set out in whichever Act gives the acquiring authority the power to acquire land for those particular purposes in the first place. Later, we will discuss amendments that involve the confirming authority transferring its power to confirm in particular circumstances. </p>

<p> Part 7, relating to compulsory purchase, is complex. Nevertheless it is very important. I would like to probe the Minister as to what is in the new clause and what is not, and why certain issues are not.</p>
<p> Government Library note SNSC 1149 says: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''The Government will take this opportunity to consider whether the proposal to recommit the bill provides an opportunity to bring forward some of the further provisions set out in the daughter document to the 18 July statement covering compulsory purchase, which will help to speed up and simplify the process and which are not dependent on the outcome of the Law Commission's work report.''</span></p>
<p> As long ago as 2001 the Government set out their thoughts in the document ''Compulsory Purchase and Compensation: delivering a fundamental change'', so they have had almost two years to consider the subject. There is still confusion among practitioners about where the Government have got to, and about timing. The ODPM website cheerfully admits that it has not had time to consult the Council of Mortgage Lenders on the issue of advanced payments of compensation to mortgagees. It adds that it hopes to have a new clause ready in time for Report. However, I see nothing </p>
<p> about that in new clause 18. Before we dispose of this new clause or the next one, I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed whether we can expect more amendments or new clauses on compensation at any stage of the Bill's passage through both Houses of Parliament. Are these the final amendments on compensation? </p>
<p> As it is clearly presaged that there are to be further proposals from the Government as a result of the Law Commission's recommendation on compulsory purchase, can the Minister clarify as far as possible, without prejudging what may be in the Queen's Speech, how these matters are to be dealt with? Some of them are included in the new clause. </p>
<p> I shall remind the Committee what was set out in the introduction to the Government's proposals: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''In order to simplify the system we''&mdash;</span></p>
<p> that is the Government&mdash;will </p>
<p><span class="indent">''provide . . . guidance in the short term on the justification required for the exercise of compulsory purchase powers for planning purposes''.</span></p>
<p> I do not see that in this new clause or in any other amendment so far. The second point was to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''provide for unopposed orders to be confirmed by the acquiring authority''.</span></p>
<p> That has been covered by the previous amendments. The third point was to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''enable objections to be considered by means of written representations where that is agreed by objectors'', </span></p>
<p>That is covered by new clause 18. The fourth point was to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''define statements of principle as the basis for compensation decisions, to replace the current plethora of, sometimes conflicting, case law''.</span></p>
<p> We dealt with that issue during an earlier sitting. The fifth point was to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''provide for the dates from which various compensation entitlements arise to be defined unambiguously in statute''.</span></p>
<p> We dealt with that in the previous new clause. The final point was to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''introduce unified Inquiry Rules, with clear deadlines for preparatory procedures.''</span></p>
<p> I certainly do not see that anywhere, and it is a big subject that needs to be dealt with at some stage. </p>
<p> The document goes on to say that to ensure that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''compensation is based on the principle of ensuring that no claimant is worse off as a result of compulsory purchase'',</span></p>
<p> there will be </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a clear statement of the principles for assessment of disturbance claims''.</span></p>
<p> We have not had any discussion of that. There will also be </p>
<p><span class="indent">''consistent compensation for the effect of the replacement scheme on retained land, whether or not land actually taken from an owner''.</span></p>
<p> We have seen that already. The list goes on: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''compensation payable for actual losses even if scheme not proceeded with''.</span></p>
<p> That is the important point that my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) made last time. If the acquiring authority issues a notice to acquire a </p>
<p> property from a farmer&mdash;I am using the excellent example given by my hon. Friend&mdash;but subsequently, for whatever reason, does not proceed to acquire the property, the farmer might have suffered considerable loss. Although powers exist in the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, which I pointed out to my hon. Friend last time, the matter needs updating and clarifying. </p>
<p> The list continues: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''all reasonable fees and unavoidable . . . taxes to be reimbursed in full''&mdash; </span></p>
<p>we have not heard anything about that&mdash; </p>
<p><span class="indent">''compensation for betterment offset only against severance/injurious affection''&mdash;</span></p>
<p> I raised that with the Minister for Housing and Planning on Tuesday, and he undertook to give us a note on the subject. The list also says that there will be </p>
<p><span class="indent">''improved provision for buying the whole site even if only part required'',</span></p>
<p> and that is covered by the new clause. Finally, there was to be </p>
<p><span class="indent">''improved advance payment arrangements, including for mortgaged land''.</span></p>
<p> That was partly dealt with under the previous new clause. </p>
<p> A number of those matters are included in the clauses that we are discussing, but some are not. For the sake of the practitioners out there, this whole subject needs to be clarified. I appreciate that the Minister cannot do that this morning, and that she would probably be out of order if she did, but if she could find a way of doing so&mdash;in a written statement, for example&mdash;that would be very helpful. </p>
<p> Most practitioners have not had a chance to look at these new clauses, but I burnt the midnight oil reading them last night, and I think that the Opposition can give them a cautious welcome. They speed up and simplify the compulsory purchase process. The Government are to be congratulated on this aspect of the Bill. It is obvious that they have listened. This is a complex subject and I applaud both of the Ministers for having addressed it well. </p>
<p> I raised the issue of what happens to a property owner who is not known, or abroad, and the Minister undertook to come back to me on that. There are 753,000 empty homes in this country, and that is only the tip of the problem. There are a number of abandoned and disregarded properties. Compulsory purchase is an important matter: if it is to become more widely used by a variety of acquiring authorities, the problem of identification might grow. I would be grateful if the Minister would address that. </p>

<p> Will my hon. Friend assist me to understand his interpretation of the legislation? If a property was compulsorily purchased and a former owner subsequently appeared, what measures are in place to compensate such people, and, perhaps, to enable them to enjoy appropriate interest on that compensation?</p>

<p> I decided not to quote from the comments on the four matters that the Government invited further views on because I was worried that I might be ruled out of order. However, they are another reason why I want the Minister to clarify how the compulsory purchase issue should be moved forward. The first matter is</p>
<p><span class="indent">''whether there should be a time limit for submitting compensation claims and, if so, what it should be.''</span></p>
<p> My hon. Friend has raised a pertinent point that is not included in this new clause, and which the Government will need to address. </p>
<p> I welcome the Government's clarification of the categories of people who are entitled to claim, and to be notified that an acquiring authority wishes to purchase their interest. In particular, it is right to include tenants in that category: in some cases&mdash;especially in residential property, with regard to which this matter is most sensitive&mdash;they have been in occupation for a considerable while, sometimes for decades. </p>
<p> I also welcome the written representation procedure, although we need some guidance on how that will work. I have already raised with the Minister the persons who may be disregarded. We need to know at what stage a full statement of case needs to be made, and what form it will take. I accept that that will probably be done by regulations, and this clause provides for that. I would be grateful if the Minister would offer at least an outline of what she proposes to include in those regulations, if not now, then as a note to the Committee or placed in the Library. </p>

<p> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify what he has said?</p>

<p> As I understand this matter, there are two stages. An objector has to make written objections, and then the confirming authority decides whether to confirm the order. It is important that we establish what sort of written representations that person has to make at that stage and whether there must be a full statement of case. I can envisage that professional advisers would, perhaps, make a summary written representation at that stage and that the confirming authority might override the objection and confirm the order. The professional adviser would be in considerable difficulty if it were felt that he should have made a full statement of case, with proofs of evidence and everything else, at that stage. We would not want to prescribe too cumbersome a procedure. If it is not necessary to provide a full statement of case at that stage, we need to know that. The Minister must tell us when the particular detail of written representation needs to be made.</p>
<p> The order in stages is a good idea that will simplify things and make them clearer for those whose property is being acquired. It will show exactly which part of their property is to be taken, and on what date. We welcome that. I understand from what the Minister said that where that type of procedure is adopted, the same system of compensation will apply as applied previously. Under the 1965 Act a person should be no worse or better off as a result of the </p>
<p> compulsory acquisition. That is the fundamental principle of compulsory purchase. If I understand it correctly, the order in stages is a thoroughly good thing. </p>
<p> These detailed new clauses would simplify and speed up the compulsory purchase procedure. The Opposition give them a cautious welcome. However, as it is such a complicated subject, perhaps the Minister could provide some clarification by whatever means he can. Because of the timing of the Bill I have not been able to obtain any guidance from practitioners or outside bodies of what they think of these new clauses. The Government are rushing the Bill through. I understand why they are doing that, but it is regrettable. Perhaps by the time the Bill reaches other stages&mdash;perhaps in the other place&mdash;practitioners will have had the chance to consider the new clauses and will come up with ideas about how they may or may not work. We give the provisions a cautious welcome. </p>

<p> We, too, welcome the proposals, which mostly clarify parts of the compulsory procedures that have probably needed clarifying for some time. I do not want to go over the ground already covered by the hon. Member for Cotswold, but I am concerned that new clause 18 may unintentionally create an objector's charter.</p>
<p> I welcome the fact that monthly and weekly tenants&mdash;the sort of people who have an interest in the land&mdash;and others with private rights of access will now have a right of objection. However, I foresee a potential problem. I am sure that hon. Members will be aware that sometimes, when people believe that compulsory purchase might happen, pieces of land are parcelled up among lots of small owners to make it difficult for the purchasing authority, which has to deal with lots of small bits of land. I foresee something similar happening. Objectors wishing to prevent a compulsory purchase could subdivide a field into one-inch squares and rent each one for a nominal sum to a large number of objectors, who would all have a statutory right of objection and, if it were not all to be done in writing, would presumably have a right to be heard. I think that that would be regarded as an unacceptable way of delaying a procedure. </p>

<p> That is an imaginative way to delay a procedure.

<p> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that such practices may seem all very well when one is on the side of wanting to stop something, rather than wanting something to go through, but clearly they are completely unacceptable.</p>
<p> I am trying to make the point that the intention should be to create a system that is fair to both sides. There is the potential in all this for determined and well organised objectors to create an unforeseen difficulty. I do not want the Government to go back </p>
<p> on what they have done to give those other people a statutory right to object, but I want to be reassured that there may be some way of dealing with broadly similar objections en bloc, rather than one by one. The Minister may be able to clarify that. </p>
<p> I especially welcome the changes to the confirmation of unopposed orders by acquiring authorities. The process of acquiring parcels of land when there appears to be no owner is slower than it needs to be. I am increasingly aware of the amount of land in my constituency that no one appears to own. There are pieces of land with access to many other properties, which people have driven across for years. When a dispute arises, however, they suddenly discover that none of the parties involved actually owns the land. </p>
<p> I have dealt with such cases a few times, one of which was at Craven Arms. A 6 ft stretch of the road leading up to the railway station at Craven Arms was crumbling away. Naturally, we told the county council to repair it. It refused, telling us that it was Railtrack's property so it was Railtrack's responsibility to carry out the work. Railtrack, however, said that its deeds said that its land finished 6 ft out. After some considerable time, it emerged that everyone believed for a very long time that it was railway property, and that British Rail probably maintained it. When British Rail transferred the railway to Railtrack, however, the transfer of deeds made it clear that it did not own that piece of land. It then took some time to acquire it. Indeed, the county council may still not have acquired it. The piece of road is used fairly regularly and continues to deteriorate; there are now large potholes in it. I welcome the proposed new clause. It makes a great deal of sense in such cases, and will not cause problems. </p>
<p> I hope that the new clauses and amendments will help the compulsory purchase system. However, will the Minister clarify whether that new clause will create an objectors' charter? We want people to have the right to object, but we do not want that right to be misused. </p>

<p> I admire the expertise of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold on these difficult, complicated and technical matters. I was going to raise one or two points, but he has broadly raised those, so I need not detain the Committee with them.</p>
<p> In summary, I must say that new clauses 18 and 19 are good clauses, as far as I understand them. I say that with the obvious caveat that I am no expert in these matters. However, I suggest to the Minister, whom I now welcome to the Committee&mdash;I had no need to intervene on the group of clauses to which she spoke on Tuesday and so did not welcome her then&mdash;that I echo my hon. Friend's request for information in answer to the queries that were understandably made. I perfectly understand that the Minister may not necessarily be able to give immediate and comprehensive answers to those questions, but answers would help not only us, but all the outside organisations that advise Members on both sides of the Committee on these very complex matters. </p>
<p> I shall comment briefly on what the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) said about ownership of land. There are little pockets of land that everyone seeks to own if there is the possibility of compensation. However, if there are any costs involved, such as in mending fences or clearing up debris, it is always someone else's problem. I have had similar experiences in my constituency, and I am sure that other hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have too. </p>
<p> I want to echo a point that I put to the Minister for Housing and Planning, the right hon. Member for Streatham (Keith Hill)&mdash;I have to keep remembering not to say ''St. Reatham''&mdash;in relation to a different group of clauses to amend the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. New clauses 18 and 19 are very long. New clause 18 would amend virtually all sections from 6 to 13 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, whereas new clause 19 would amend and introduce considerable addenda to schedule 1 to the 1981 Act. When the Bill goes through, it would be sensible to introduce not only a consolidated town and country planning Act, but a consolidated version of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981&mdash;I do not expect an answer to that suggestion, but some thoughts would be encouraging. That would be helpful to all those who will have to operate under the new legislation, whatever form it takes. </p>

<p> I raise the issue again because I am referring to a different Act: the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. Also, if a consolidated Bill that just brings together all the strands of law that relate to that legislation is put before the House, we shall not even need a debate.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is right that consolidated legislation makes life considerably easier for practitioners and those who need to use the relevant Acts, and we seek to make progress on that as far as possible. However, the obvious constraint on doing so is that although it does not require a huge amount of parliamentary time, it requires an awful lot of legal time and work to put together, and we often ask the same experts and the same counsel whom we ask to work on Bills and new legislation to do that work too. I shall certainly take back the points that the hon. Gentleman has made, but he will realise that there are constraints on how rapidly we can do such things.</p>
<p> The hon. Member for Cotswold asked whether the amendments before us were final or whether we intended to take the matter further. It would be wrong to say that these are the final amendments, because the Bill is being considered in Committee and we shall need to examine further points that are raised. As Bills pass through Parliament, things need to be changed, tidied up and resolved in response to issues that are raised. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that at this stage we are not planning to introduce any new issues on the compulsory purchase front. The Law </p>
<p> Commission is currently considering many of the extremely important points that he has raised on compulsory purchase, and its final report is due at the turn of the year. Until then we cannot assess the need for new legislation or any consultation. </p>
<p> We have decided to take forward the aspects that we think most important and on which the necessary improvements are most straightforward. The Law Commission is considering the complex interrelated issues to do with compensation, and we shall respond to its recommendations in due course and decide how to take them forward. That was set out in the July 2002 policy statement, following agreement with the Law Commission. </p>

<p> The Minister has clarified the position just as I understood it. Therefore I am slightly surprised that the Government have tabled the new clauses, welcome as they are, without having thought through the whole subject of compulsory purchase. The new clauses may well constrain the Law Commission in what it can recommend. I do not want to be churlish, but the new clauses seem to offer a procedure that has been only partially thought out.</p>

<p> We do not expect the approach that we have taken, and matters that arise from the new clauses, to be a constraint on the Law Commission or any response that we might make to it. It has become clear from the debate in Committee that hon. Members of all parties recognise that the changes are sensible and will make life simpler, speeding up the process and making it fairer for particular groups. As we are dealing with a planning Bill, it seems right to move on with the items on which there is broad agreement and which will make things better in the short term. It is always possible for the best to be the enemy of the good and, in parliamentary terms, for the whole to be the enemy of the parts. We could delay doing sensible things until we had resolved every detail of the future of the universe. I do not think that we should do that now; it is right to introduce the measures in question.</p>
<p> The hon. Member for Cotswold raised a point about abandoned properties and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight asked what would happen if an owner reappeared. If owners do not come forward, so long as reasonable attempts have been made to identify them, compulsory purchase orders can proceed. There are sometimes different procedures for dealing with the matter through the general vesting declaration. Compensation would be paid into court and could be claimed if an owner subsequently reappeared. </p>
<p> The written procedure would not disadvantage someone whose objection was disregarded. If the objection were disregarded because it was purely about compensation it would go to the Lands Tribunal, just as it currently does. The person concerned would be in exactly the same position as they would under the current arrangements. With luck, the process might be resolved considerably faster, because of the written procedure. </p>
<p> Secondary legislation, following consultations, would be needed to set out the detail and workings of the written procedures, and the method for making </p>
<p> objections. However, we have attempted to inform the Committee's deliberations in a paper setting out our broad intentions, which I believe hon. Members have now been sent, and which I have already mentioned. However, further consultation will clearly be needed before we can specify exact details. </p>
<p> To respond to what seemed to be the concern behind this question, the point is the need for clarity for all concerned. That has been the problem so far, and it is the reason why there has never been agreement on a written procedure, even though it was possible in theory. No one can agree on a case-by-case basis about what would constitute nice, clear, fair procedures that would enable everyone to know the deal and understand at what point representations would be considered or a full representation needed to be made. Statutory force is needed to provide that clarity. </p>

<p> Our rough timetable is to do so around the time of commencement. That will not take us far into the future, but the hon. Gentleman will understand that those who are to work on the detail of the consultation process and the written procedures have first to complete work on the passage of the Bill. I shall be happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with further details.</p>
<p> The hon. Member for Ludlow was concerned that this might prove to be an objectors' charter. That is not the intention. Although a wide range of groups should, rightly, be able to have their objections heard, the fact that we shall have written procedures will speed the process up. As for whether somebody could subdivide land to increase the number of objectors, that could happen under the current arrangements; however many owners there are, and however small the area owned, they have the right to have their objections heard. There will be time restrictions under the new procedures, just as there are now. </p>

<p> It would be easier for somebody to sub-let on short lets than to subdivide and sell off, because the original owner would not then own the land. I foresee a landowner who does not want his land to be compulsorily purchased rushing round finding lots of people to sub-let it to on six-month leases, thus entitling them to object. That will be a more attractive route for objectors than the former one, the sale of subdivisions of the land, which has happened in some cases.</p>

<p> I guess that if the landowner were sufficiently ingenious and determined to sub-let all kinds of corners of land, that would mean more people had the right to object; it could happen. However, there will be a limit to the time in which they might submit objections and&mdash;assuming that those will not be the cases that go to written procedures, as the intention will be to spin things out&mdash;there will be a public inquiry timetable, just as there is at the moment.</p>
<p> There is a limit to the additional problems that can be caused by the procedure, and they are counter-balanced by its increased fairness and the fact that it gives more people who are entitled the chance to have their objections heard. For those reasons, I believe that the new clauses are sensible and I welcome the broad support of the Committee.</p>

<p> We now come to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold: how information about interest should be acquired. An authority seeking to acquire land needs to know the names and addresses of those occupying and having an interest in that land in order to be able to enter into negotiations to purchase by agreement. It is also necessary to have that information if the authority seeks to acquire the land compulsorily, because it is required to serve notice of the making of the compulsory purchase order on such persons. Correctly ascertaining those interests in the land at an early stage must be fairer for the persons affected. The authority can inform them of its intentions and try to negotiate a purchase by agreement. It saves time if the authority can have confidence in the information that it has gathered, and helps to ensure that the compulsory purchase order is prepared correctly, including serving the appropriate notices on all the right people.</p>
<p> Some acquiring authorities already have powers to require such information. Such powers usually do not extend to requiring information about all interests in land. In view of the extended categories of persons to be served with notice of the making of the CPO under new clause 18, which we have already discussed and included in the Bill, such powers may be inadequate. Other acquiring authorities, including the regional development agencies, the urban regeneration agency&mdash;English Partnerships&mdash;and urban development corporations, have no such power. Despite the fact that much of the land that they may need to assemble will be on brownfield sites, where ownership and occupation details are likely to be complex, there is no obvious reason for that inconsistency, which can impede the compulsory purchase process. </p>
<p> For completeness, I ought to add that for land in unknown ownership all is not lost. There is a statutory procedure for the service of notices at the making of a CPO under section 6(4) of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, referred to by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir Sydney Chapman). However, before resorting to that procedure, the acquiring authority must first be satisfied that reasonable inquiry has been made and that it is not practicable to ascertain the name and address of an owner, lessee or occupier. Without a statutory power to requisition for information, such an inquiry can cause considerable delay. The amendment therefore introduces a new section into the 1981 Act to enable all acquiring authorities to require information for the purposes of acquiring land or new rights over land in cases where the provisions of that Act apply. That does not mean that land necessarily has to be compulsorily acquired or even acquired by agreement. However, the power to obtain the names and addresses may be exercised only for the purpose of enabling the authority to acquire the land in question. </p>
<p> The acquiring authorities' notice has to be in writing and must set a deadline for a response, which must also be in writing. The range of people on whom such a notice can be served is limited to the occupiers of that land, any freeholders, mortgagees or lessees, the recipient of rent for the land and anyone who manages the land under an agreement with someone else who has an interest in it. The notice requires details to be provided of anyone whom the recipient believes to be an owner, lessee or occupier of the land, or to have another interest in it. Failure to comply with such a notice without reasonable excuse is to be an offence. It will also be an offence for a person responding to the notice served on him to give information that is false in a material particular that he either knows is false or ought reasonably to know is false. </p>
<p> If either offence is committed by a body corporate with the consent or connivance of certain officers, or is attributable to any neglect on the part of officers of the body corporate, that officer will also be guilty of the offence.

<p> The Opposition broadly welcome new clause 20. It is essential to acquire accurate and correct information. I note, however, that interestingly, in our previous discussions, the Crown was by and large exempted from providing such information. It is a slight paradox that individuals should be required to provide such information, yet the Crown should not necessarily be so required. I mention that in passing.</p>
<p> The Minister mentioned the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. The provisions of section 6(4) are worded in an interesting way, which the House must have approved, but it is quite ambiguous. It talks about the document being served by addressing it to the </p>
<p><span class="indent">'' 'owner', 'lessee' or 'occupier' of the land (describing it) to which it relates, by delivering to some person on the premises or, if there is no person on the premises to whom it may be delivered''&mdash;</span></p>
<p> this is the interesting bit&mdash; </p>
<p><span class="indent">''by affixing it or a copy of it''</span></p>
<p> on or near the land. Under that provision, someone could drop a copy somewhere on a field, and it might be blown away. The Minister is absolutely right to clarify the position. The document should be well and truly attached in a prominent place. We therefore welcome the clarification proposed in the new clause. </p>
<p> I turn to proposed new section 5B and the matter of corporate offences&mdash;a subject that my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight addresses in amendment (a). </p>
<p> It seems to me that the whole of subsection (3) could have been amazingly simplified if it had been worded thus: ''Offences under this section by corporations shall be construed to have the same meaning as in section 331 in the principal Act.'' That would have obviated the need for the whole of subsection (3), which largely repeats what is in the principal Act. I am making a minor and gentle criticism of the drafting. I sometimes think that parliamentary draftsmen like to put the maximum number of words on a page; I think that they should be paid for using the fewest words needed to achieve the desired result. </p>
<p> I must say to my hon. Friend that having looked at the subsection I see no need for amendment (a), because the subsection deals with corporate offences. I do not think that elected authorities come into that category, and I am not sure that my hon. Friend's amendment is relevant. However, he will make his own case for it. </p>
<p> The Opposition welcome the new clause. It forms part of the compensation package, which we welcome. </p>

<p> I am grateful for the pointer offered by my hon. Friend on how I might explain my amendment. I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I assume in amendment (a) that a local authority is a body corporate. If so, certain people are clearly responsible for running it, and responsible for the information that may be provided by that body corporate in response to such an invitation. Many of the executive responsibilities of local authorities now rest with members, not with directors, managers, secretaries or other similar officers. An executive member of a local authority may respond&mdash;and certainly may consent to or connive in&mdash;a response to an invitation to provide information.</p>
<p> The amendment is intended to elicit whether the Government are confident that those in a local authority who use their executive power to consent or connive in an offence under the clause would be caught. The amendment would ensure that a councillor doing so would be caught&mdash;at least, that it is the intention. </p>

<p> I welcome the new clause. However, I want to discuss the amendment. It is a shame that the Minister has not yet clarified whether ''body corporate'' includes local authorities; the two Conservative Members who have spoken disagree about that. I shall speak on the assumption that it might include local authorities.</p>
<p> I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says. However, I would have even more sympathy if councillors were not constrained in other ways. At the moment, because of the behaviour of the Standards Board for England and the effect of the code of conduct, in many cases councillors are tried twice for the same offence. I am concerned about the possibility that another context may now arise in which that happens. I do not want to go into detail, because I hope that Mr. Speaker will allow me an Adjournment debate on the subject at some point. However, I can foresee a situation in which a councillor might be found guilty under the clause, </p>
<p> and then be reported to the Standards Board and perhaps suspended from the council; a second penalty would be imposed. </p>
<p> My concern is not that the clause is not the right approach. It probably is. We probably need to remove the consequential effects with reference to the Standards Board. If the provision applies to local authorities I shall be interested to hear the Minister explain whether councillors should be tried twice for the same offence, as happens now in other contexts. </p>

<p> I want to make a different point about new clause 20. However, first I must say that I share, very emotionally, the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold that Bills should be kept to the minimum necessary length. The more complex the Bill, the truer that is. Shortness is a good thing&mdash;although of course Back-Bench speeches in Committee are an exception from that rule.</p>
<p> Keeping in mind what I see as the central principle of the Bill&mdash;to speed up the planning and compulsory purchase process without sacrificing the rights of individuals or the fairness of the system&mdash;I draw the Minister's attention to subsection (5) of the new section 5A that new clause 20 would insert into the Acquisition of Land Act 1981: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''The notice must specify the period within which the information must be given to the acquiring authority (being a period of not less than 14 days beginning with the day on which the notice is served).''</span></p>
<p> I am all for speeding up the compulsory purchase process, but I wonder whether 14 days is an unfairly short time. I know that the phrase used is </p>
<p><span class="indent">''not less than 14 days'',</span></p>
<p> but I am long enough in the tooth, at least in relation to town and country planning laws, to know that the minimum becomes the maximum for the authority serving the notice or deciding the issues. </p>
<p> I do not know whether other members of the Committee have encountered the same complaints as I have, particularly around August, when people write bitterly to their MP to say that the local planning authority served notice of a planning proposal when it knew that everyone would be away on their fortnight's holiday. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman has hit on a good point. One of the relevant categories is the occupier of the land, which could mean a tenant, who might well be away on holiday for more than 14 days. That would be very unfortunate. The period of 14 days is probably fair for a former utility, for example, but allowance should be made for the circumstances of individuals.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.8.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/792" speakername="Sydney Chapman" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s07.htm" colnum="103">
<p> I am glad to have the hon. Gentleman's support. In fairness, a period longer than 14 days should be specified, for the reason that I gave. Furthermore, it is a good thing to simplify procedure as far as possible. I do not claim to know about compulsory acquisitions or compensation, but my experience of the town and country planning legislation is that often, if an appeal is made to the Secretary of State and an inspector is called after a local planning authority has turned down an</p>
<p> application, one is usually asked to make a representation within 28 days or, in some cases, six weeks.</p>
<p> For the sake of simplicity, I ask the Minister seriously to consider the possibility of changing the minimum requirement of 14 days to, say, 28. I hope that he acts constructively on that suggestion, which is entirely meant to be helpful. </p>

<p> I am grateful to members of the Committee for the spirit in which they have addressed this matter and for their broad support for these very reasonable proposals. The point made by the hon. Member for Cotswold shows there is agreement across the water on the need for conciseness in drafting legislation. On his critique of proposed new section 5B(3), however, I must say to him that it is needed, as it refers to section 331 of the 1990 Act, not to the Acquisition of Land Act 1981.</p>

<p> I may have skirted very quickly over proposed new section 5B(3), but I hope that Hansard will show, if I read out my notes correctly, that I said that it has the same meaning as section 331 of the principal Act. I anticipated that the Minister would not like my solution&mdash;Governments do not often like new solutions&mdash;but I believe that if he examines it he will see that it might work.</p>

<p> I shall reconsider the hon. Gentleman's solution, but I stick to the line that I adopted a couple of years ago that the principal Act in question is the 1990 Act.</p>
<p> I am perfectly happy for the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet to refer to me as the hon. Member for St. Reatham&mdash;we are trying to be up-market. He made a reasonable point about the period of 14 days' notice, within which information must be given. I shall attempt to reassure him by pointing out that this time is allowed for providing factual information, not for further action. It identifies the minimum period, which in most circumstances is quite likely to be longer. There is a precedent for this in section 16 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, which contains a similar power. Allowing 14 days is therefore well established. </p>
<p> On the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, to which the hon. Member for Ludlow referred, both hon. Gentlemen asked whether a local authority is a body corporate. The answer is yes. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight also asked whether a councillor might be caught by the provisions. The answer is no, or not directly, for reasons that I shall attempt to explain. Generally speaking, councillors cannot discharge local authority functions individually. Where a councillor is responsible, it should be for the courts to decide whether he or she can be said to be a person who falls into any of the categories in section 5B(3)&mdash;that is, a person purporting to act in the capacity of a director, manager, secretary or similar officer. </p>

<p> I hear what my right hon. Friend says about the section, but does that line of argument apply across the board to the different executive functions allowed for by the Local Government Act 2000, which, coincidentally, I</p>
<p> happen to have in front of me, and specifically to an elected mayor, who has an executive function and authority over and above other councillors?</p>

<p> I think the Minister has confirmed the fact that without the amendment a court could in certain circumstances regard a councillor as having come within the meaning of the relevant provisions. Will he therefore confirm that we are considering another situation in which a councillor could be tried twice for the same offence? I am sure that a court's decision that a councillor had committed such an offence would automatically have to be reported to the standards board, which would undertake a second investigation of that councillor. Can he confirm that I am correct?</p>

<p> I regret to say that I am not willing to pursue the hon. Gentleman down that path and ex cathedra make a commitment on whether a councillor would be subject to double jeopardy in that situation. We are on speculative terrain&mdash;this is a classic case of whatifery from him&mdash;and I am content to rest on my observation that the matter is essentially for the courts to decide.</p>

<p> May I summarise my understanding of what the Minister said? He said that the new clause will not generally catch a councillor, but that the courts may interpret it if they think that a councillor is acting as a director, manager, secretary or other similar officer. I am not sure whether that means exercising an executive function, which is what I understand councillors to be capable of under the modernised council procedures.</p>
</speech>

<p> We all need to be a little careful when discussing such matters as to what commitments we make vis-à-vis the courts. My judgment would be that a councillor in an executive capacity nevertheless continues to act on behalf of the collective entity that is the local authority, and is to that extent deemed in any normal circumstances to be acting as part of a collective entity, not individually. To that extent, the councillor is not discharging an individual function and is not ''purporting to act'' in the capacity of a director, manager, secretary or similar officer.</p>

<p> I am sorry to pursue the matter in this way, but although an elected mayor is not a councillor, an elected mayor nevertheless has a different executive capacity from that of an officer of the council as implied by the proposed provisions. We should bear in mind the principle of Occam's razor, which the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet enunciated, so would it not be a good idea to use in the proposal words such as ''neglect on the part of any person purporting to act in the capacity of officer or director of a body corporate''? We could cut out proposed new section 5B(3)(a) and (b), and have just one line that the courts would then judge.</p>

I do not think that the provisions will apply in many circumstances. I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman has further details on the subject. They are a specific group of cases for which different procedures apply. Whenever anyone wants to go through the compulsory purchase order process in relation to fuel or field garden allotments, there are different procedures to be gone through&mdash;just as with common land or open spaces. That is why they are grouped together with the fuel or field garden allotments. </p>
<p> I should like to say a little more about subsection (2) in general, which might explain the reasons for the provisions. The approach is to exclude compulsory purchase orders in the case of land for which additional procedures may apply involving, for example, the Minister responsible for the policy or special parliamentary procedures. Because those cases will be dependent on people's decisions in other places or because other processes may need to be gone through, it does not make sense simply to be able to transfer those confirmations back to the acquiring authority. </p>
<p> Subsection (2) also excludes compulsory purchase orders involving statutory undertakers&mdash;in other words, the utilities&mdash;in cases when they argue that the land is needed for operational purposes. Again, those may well involve ministerial decisions and other procedures that need to be gone through. </p>
<p> Subsection (3) limits the scope for giving an acquiring authority the power to confirm its own compulsory purchase order to cases where there are no outstanding objections and where the order can be confirmed without modification. It also requires the confirming order to be satisfied that all the necessary statutory requirements as to the service and </p>
<p> publication of notices have been complied with before contemplating the transfer. The confirming authority will retain confirmation in a series of cases, where, for example, notices have not been complied with, there are objections, or modifications are needed. In all those cases, a judgment may need to be made about whether things have been handled fairly and about what is the balance. In such circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the acquiring authority to make that judgment, because it could be argued that it is not an unbiased judge. Therefore, the confirmation power must lie elsewhere. </p>
<p> The new provision will, even with those restrictions, help to speed up the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders by enabling the confirming authority to give the power of confirmation to the acquiring authority. We also hope that it will provide an incentive that encourages acquiring authorities to prepare compulsory purchase orders carefully, so that they may confirm those themselves. In doing that, they must take care, and ensure that no technical modifications become necessary as a result of errors. We also hope that the provision will encourage acquiring authorities to consult those who are affected by their scheme and discuss with them from an early stage the proposals and any concerns. That will minimise the risk of formal objections once the order is made. Those steps will help to speed up the confirmation process and make it less stressful for those whose land is required. </p>
<p> Subsections (7) and (8) allow the confirming authority to revoke the transfer at any time until the acquiring authority sends the notification. That might become necessary, for example, if the confirming authority received a late objection raising important issues, or if the acquiring authority failed to take any action towards confirmation after a reasonable period of time had elapsed and those affected by the order made representations to the confirming authority about the delay and consequent uncertainty. The procedure is sensible. We hope that it will help to speed up the process in the most straightforward cases that could be handled in such a way. </p>

<p> Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet. On reading the paragraph that deals with ''fuel'', I, too, thought that it was a mistake. That paragraph arises from section 19 of the principal Act, which deals with commons and open spaces. Under subsection (4) a</p>
<p><span class="indent">''fuel or field garden allotment''</span></p>
<p> means any allotment set out as a fuel allotment, or a field garden allotment, under the Inclosure Acts 1845 and 1842. [Interruption.] I was not intending to get at my hon. Friend&mdash;I am merely trying to help him. That subsection was intended to apply to such things as opencast coal mines, electricity apparatus and underground storage, including gas storage, and so forth, as was made clear. </p>

<p> My hon. Friend may not be aware of them&mdash;they may be so secret that they do not exist. We have, of course, discussed that already.</p>
<p> Seriously, though, we welcome new clause 21, but I should like to ask the Minister one question. The new clause is, in a sense, making it easier for an acquiring authority to operate a compulsory purchase order. We must be careful where people's interests are being compulsorily acquired. Although that is a serious matter, we have not touched on the principles of compulsory purchase this morning. Where we are making it easier, we should build appropriate safeguards into the legislation that we are making. I am concerned that subsection (4) says: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''An objection is made by any person (whether or not a person mentioned in section 12(2)), including an objection which is disregarded.''</span></p>
<p> I accepted the explanation when we discussed it in a different context under 12(2), but where we are making it easier for an acquiring authority to operate, and if there is any objection, the acquiring authority should not have the power&mdash;it should go to a confirming authority. Perhaps the Minister will consider that carefully. I am a little bit concerned about that subsection. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.10.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s09.htm" colnum="109">
<p> Let me clarify what I understand to be the position with regard to the point that the hon. Gentleman raised. I will be happy to look further into the matter if that is necessary.</p>
<p> First, where objections are disregarded because they are to do with compensation rather than the nature of the compulsory purchase order, the consultation process takes place in exactly the same way, so people's interests are not harmed at all by the decision for the confirming authority to pass it back to the acquiring authority. Secondly, we have structured this clause differently, so that there is a fresh approach from that which was previously taken. We are not simply referring to there being remaining objections from those who have a statutory authority. One cannot transfer the confirming power back to the acquiring authority even if there is an objection&mdash;including one that has been disregarded. Subsection (4) states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''An objection is an objection made by any person (whether or not a person mentioned in section 12(2)), including an objection which is disregarded.''</span></p>
<p> The new clause does what the hon. Gentleman wants it to do. When people's interests are being balanced, it is important that a proper independent judgment is taken. We would not want concerns to be raised that a judgment was being made about people's interests by someone who was effectively a party to that judgment or had an interest. That was the reason for making it more difficult to transfer confirming power back to the acquiring authority in these circumstances. </p>
<p> Question put and agreed to. </p>
<p> Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill. </p>

<p> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
<p> It is a matter of great regret that the title that I have come up with for this new clause does not share the resonance of some of the titles that the Government have given to their new clauses. Some of those titles&mdash;such as ''Old mining permissions: Scotland''&mdash;remind me almost of a barrel of real ale from the Ventnor brewery. </p>
<p> My new clause is an attempt to deal with a serious issue of which many of us are aware. It adopts two principles. The first, which has been enunciated by the Minister, is that the whole is the enemy of the parts. The second principle is one of conscientious plagiarism taken from Bills introduced by noble Friend Baroness Gardner of Parkes in another place and by the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) in this place. </p>

<p> I hesitate to intervene on my hon. Friend, but I would like to put on the record that the noble Baroness Gardner of Parkes's Bill was almost identical in every respect to the Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). I would not like his contribution not to be recognised.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.36.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" speakername="Andrew Turner" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s13.htm" colnum="132">
<p> My hon. Friend is kind to remind me about that. Looking further down in my notes, I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull did introduce such a Bill, which nearly got through the whole parliamentary process.</p>
<p> The Government carried out a detailed consultation in 1999 on the impact of high hedges. More than 3,000 people and organisations responded, which for a Government consultation must be approaching a record&mdash;it is certainly more than responded to some consultations on regional referendums. The result showed that 94 per cent. of respondents believed that new laws were needed to control high hedges. Some 70 per cent. of local authorities that responded supported that belief. The proposal was made that local authorities should be able to determine complaints. I have not gone along that road because it has failed twice at least, for various reasons. Therefore, I have adopted a slightly different route. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, the Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull fell in April 2001 because of an imminent general election, although the then Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Environment and the Regions reminded us that it is </p>
<p><span class="indent">''the Government's commitment to introduce new laws to solve hedge problems in England and Wales.''</span></p>
<p> He added that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''we could not find room for such a Bill in this Session''&mdash;</span></p>
<p> that is, the Session that ended in 2001. He also said: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''We are therefore pleased that the hon. Member for Solihull is pursuing the matter and that the Bill would apply to England and Wales.''&mdash;[Official Report, 9 March 2001; Vol. 364, c. 575.]</span></p>
<p> The 2001 Queen's Speech also failed to mention a high hedges Bill. Government officials said that they were committed to bringing forward legislation when parliamentary time became available and the then Secretary of State told Hedgeline in a letter on 26 July 2001 that the Government remained committed to introducing new laws as soon as there was space in the parliamentary timetable. I will not go through the frequently reiterated Government commitments on the matter, but this is the opportunity for the Minister to give us half a loaf, if not a whole loaf, and to respond to that need. </p>
<p> Two Bills were introduced in the current Session&mdash;one in the Lords and one by the hon. Member for Ealing, North. When the Commons Bill failed, the hon. Member for Ealing, North asked the Prime Minister, no less, on 17 September 2003, what he was going to do about it. The Prime Minister repeated that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''the Government have had a long-standing commitment since August 2000 to bring forward new laws to give local authorities in England and Wales powers to determine complaints about high garden hedges and will make every effort to get them on to the statute book at the earliest opportunity. I cannot say better than that.''&mdash;[Official Report, 17 September 2003; Vol. 410, c. 859&ndash;60.]</span></p>
<p> Now is the opportunity for the Minister to score lots of brownie points, but she is not the only one who is trying to do so. My noble Friend continues to persist, and tabled amendment No. 194 to the Anti-social Behaviour Bill as recently as 7 October. The Front-Bench spokesman, Lord Bassam, expressed great sympathy for her case: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''I understand why inserting suitable provisions in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill is on the face of it a very attractive proposition. This is a thoroughly anti-social problem. I believe that the noble Baroness described people who are victims of it as hedge victims. She is absolutely right about that. We recognise that some people are victims of such anti-social behaviour on the part of their neighbours. I certainly admire the vigour with which she has attempted to argue the new clause into the scope of the Bill.''</span></p>
<p> He went on to say that he was not prepared to accept the amendment, adding: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''As Members of the Committee have said, we do not get too many legislative opportunities, and I could not give a commitment as to when the Government could find a legislative slot in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">We as a government want to see such legislation ultimately on the statute book. We recognise the matter for the problem that it is.''&mdash;[Official Report, House of Lords, 7 October 2003; Vol. 653, c. 251&ndash;52.]</span></p>
<p> To be fair, he did say that he would look at it again, but ''ultimately'' is a long way away. </p>
<p> The new clause will deliver only half of what people want&mdash;it will prevent such problems from arising in future&mdash;but it does not pretend to deal with the difficult question of what happens to those who already suffer from such problems. I have had many letters, as I am sure other Members have, asking me to support various legislation, but I have also had letters asking me not to support the proposal in the Bill because of its retrospective nature. It allows people to ask those who believe that they have grown nice tall hedges for good reasons to have them cut down. My proposal would not do that. Let me give an example from Bembridge in my constituency that shows why it is appropriate. </p>
<p> Somebody sold a plot of land adjacent to his home for housing purposes and planted a hedge that was designed to rise to about 6 ft, or 2 m. That was many years ago and the hedge has now grown that high. Now, the people who have bought the houses&mdash;some of them the second or third owners&mdash;are complaining about the hedge, but it was there before they were. Many feel that it is unfair that they should be able to do nothing about the hedges, while others feel that it would be unfair were they able to do something. I solve the problem by doing nothing about it, although I am proposing a mechanism that will ensure that it does not arise in future. I shall now try to describe that mechanism, and I am indebted to the officials of the House who have helped me by drafting the proposal. </p>
<p> Planning permission would be required for high hedges, and the new clause describes what would be considered to be a ''high hedge''. The first requirement is that it would be </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a barrier to light for, or access to, residential property.''</span></p>
<p> Therefore, one would not have to get planning permission unless the hedge, or part of it, were such a barrier. The second requirement is that it </p>
<p><span class="indent">''is formed wholly or predominantly by a line of two or more evergreens'',</span></p>
<p> and the third is that it </p>
<p><span class="indent">''rises to a height of more than two metres above ground level.''</span></p>
<p> I would much have preferred to specify 6 ft, but I am told that this is what we have to say nowadays. The new clause goes on to define an evergreen&mdash;I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet, as a former president of the Institute of Arboriculturalists, could do so too&mdash;and says: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''The provisions of this section shall not apply to any high hedge existing on the date on which it comes into force.''</span></p>
<p> In other words, if one's hedge had grown beyond 2 m on the date on which the requirement came into force, the new clause would not apply to it. I leave Ministers with half a loaf and this Minister with the opportunity to satisfy at least half the Prime Minister's pledge, as well as the problem of satisfying the rest of it. I believe that the new clause would ensure that people no longer risked finding themselves in the circumstances that are able to claim them as victims at the moment. </p>

<p> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on having suggested the new clause. I was one of the named supporters of the Bill championed by the hon. Member for Ealing, North. The only problem with the most recent of the failed Bills&mdash;in his potted history, the hon. Member for Isle of Wight mentioned three, but I think that there have been five in recent years&mdash;was that the hon. Member for Christchurch talked it out. Fortunately, he is not on this Committee, which is welcome if we are to debate the issue as that gives us an opportunity to legislate on it without having certain Members talking out a measure that has the overwhelming support of Members of all parties. It may be only half a loaf, but it is a good half loaf. However, I have been on too many Committees in the past few years to believe that the Minister will accept it as it stands. I suspect that she will say that she will consider the matter and possibly return to it, but that may not be enough. It is usually done to suggest that something should not happen.</p>
<p> The Minister may have been advised that the Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for this issue, but it is likely to be the most appropriate that we will have for a very long time. We have seen the problems with private Members' legislation, so unless the Minister knows something that she cannot tell us such as that an appropriate Bill might appear in the Queen's Speech&mdash;I suspect, however, that the Government may have more pressing priorities than a high hedges Bill&mdash;she will be doing the House a disservice if she does not take this opportunity, because I cannot foresee when the next one will arise for incorporating such a proposal in Government legislation. </p>
<p> I fully support the new clause. If the Minister picks me up on any technical drafting errors&mdash;the other reason that Ministers use to reject new clauses&mdash;I suggest that with all three parties working together, we can rapidly find ways of reintroducing it on Report. It would take very little time on the Floor of the House to do that. My only regret is that in this instance, it has been introduced by a Member whose name is not quite </p>
<p> as appropriate to the subject as is that of the noble Baroness Gardner of Parkes. For the sake of posterity, I wish that it had been her Bill, as that would have made it one of the most appropriate Bills that could ever have been invented. </p>

<p> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight on the way in which he introduced his new clause. I have heard three memorable speeches about the need to tackle the problem of high hedges; they were made by my hon. Friends the Members for Isle of Wight and for Solihull, and by the hon. Member for Ealing, North&mdash;all of whose facility for style and wit I admire. I particularly admire the hon. Member for Ealing, North, whom I regard as the living personification of Mr. Punch&mdash;but in saying that, I hope that I am not thought to be the living personification of the Reverend Obadiah Slope.</p>
<p> My hon. Friend asked me to tell the Committee what a coniferous shrub or tree is. Before I attempt to do so, I should say that although I was the instigator of national tree year in 1973, and was president of the Arboricultural Association for many years before I became a Minister, I am not an expert on trees; I simply love them. I understand that, in layman's language, a coniferous tree does not shed its leaves, whereas a deciduous tree does. The point is that because an evergreen or coniferous tree does not shed its leaves, it forms a permanent barrier that light cannot get through. </p>
<p> As my hon. Friend said, the issue raises great emotions. There are some&mdash;certainly one or two in my party&mdash;who, if I judge their views rightly, think that we have enough pressing problems with town and country planning laws and regulations, and we do not need any more. They think that to try to extend the planning system to hedges is taking a step too far. There are others&mdash;I am in this category&mdash;who recognise that high hedges are a real menace, and involve the loss of rights for neighbouring properties. </p>
<p> We rightly always pay regard to the need to preserve rights of way for ordinary people, but we make rights to light a second-class issue, although they are equally important. I am pleased that my hon. Friend has recognised the qualification someone should be required to take action to reduce the height of a hedge only when there is loss of light for a neighbour. That usually happens because a property owner puts high hedges on his or her northern boundary&mdash;which is, of course, the southern side of the property behind, and materially affects the light to that property. I applaud my hon. Friend for making that distinction. </p>
<p> It is right that the new clause specifies </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a line of two or more evergreens''.</span></p>
<p> One could perhaps live with one evergreen, because evergreens, or coniferous trees, tend to grow high but are relatively narrow. The definition of a hedge is, I suppose, two or more shrubs or trees&mdash;although I am not a lawyer, so perhaps I will be picked up on that definition. </p>
<p> The new clause also defines a high hedge as one that is 2 m in height. I come from an age where imperial </p>
<p> preference had two good meanings, and I resist using the metric system, although of course it is now part of our law and we have to live with it. Suffice it to say that 2 m is about 6¼ inches higher than 6 ft. That is, however, by the way. My point is that if one wishes to put up a fence on the side boundaries or at the back of a property, it must be less than 2 m high. One has to get planning permission if one wants to put up a fence higher than 2 m, so the choice of the 2 m height limit is very apposite. </p>
<p> I can understand, although I will be very sorry, if the Minister feels that the new clause should be resisted. In the light of what my hon. Friend said about the commitments and semi-commitments of Ministers, not least the Prime Minister, I hope that if the Minister asks us to resist the new clause he will feel able to give a commitment that legislation will be mentioned in the Queen's Speech on 26 November. If not, I hope that the Government will make a specific commitment to support a private Member's Bill, and to help draft it if necessary, in the new Session. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-10-14_A_03-0_2003-10-16a.36.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" time="11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st031016/am/31016s14.htm" colnum="136">
<p> I did not speak earlier, because I wanted to hear what hon. Members had to say about the new clause first. I unhesitatingly congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight on bringing it before the Committee. It gives the opportunity for an important subject to be debated.</p>
<p> I know that some members of our party take a different view, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet said, but the Conservative Opposition's view is that the matter is a significant problem. Some 10,000 cases are outstanding, and we believe that the Government should honour their promises to legislate on the matter. Without exception, all Members of Parliament will have had correspondence about difficult cases in which people have been severely inconvenienced by high hedges. I know of a case of one London resident who has a 30 ft hedge within a yard on both sides of their small property, and nothing can be done about that. We need some legislation. </p>
<p> To that end, I considered tabling the Bill that was promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull in its entirety as a new clause. I do not want to be churlish about the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight, as it provides an excellent opportunity to debate the subject, but it has several shortcomings. I am sure that the Minister will pick up on them, but it might be helpful if I pick up on them first. </p>
<p> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet, I have spent many hours, both on the Floor of the House and in Committee, on this problem. I sat through the debates on the Bills introduced by both my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull and the hon. Member for Ealing, North. The Government should take the earliest opportunity to remedy the problem with legislation. We want there to be some flexibility, because if two neighbours living side by side are happy with a high hedge, the Government should not intervene. Intervention should occur only when one of the parties has a problem with the hedge. We are wary about blanket legislation, and I would want to see some arbitration procedure built in, so a local </p>
<p> authority could be invited to resolve a dispute if either party has a problem. </p>
<p> New clause 1 would be prospective, not retrospective, and the Government already have 10,000 problems to deal with, which would be a massive work load for planning authorities throughout the country. On top of the heavy work load provided by the Bill, that would be a real problem, so the Government should perhaps introduce some phasing to deal first with prospective problems and then with retrospective problems. </p>
<p> My hon. Friend's new clause has some specific problems. I emphasise again that in identifying them, I am trying to be helpful rather than churlish. As Committee members know, evergreen hedges can grow by at least 3 ft a year, especially if they are leylandii. What was not a problem at the beginning of the year can become a significant problem by the end of it, and we need to find a mechanism to deal with it. A hedge can, and should, be trimmed to a height of 2 m&mdash;or 6 ft 6 in&mdash;but if one party is obstinate and does not trim it, and an order is made against them, who will be entitled to do the work? The Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull provided that the local authority could do the work and charge the occupier who was causing the problem, and there should be some such safeguard in the Bill. </p>
<p> I had a problem with the Bills introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull and by the hon. Member for Ealing, North, because they both refused to contemplate amendments on this matter. We would not want to make any legislation too all-encompassing, but the problem of high hedges occurs only with leylandii, Lawson cypress and laurel. Any legislation would need a tight definition of those species, because otherwise rare and more special species could be caught up. We would have to be very careful before cutting down hedges of unusual species, because the more special the species, the more likely it is that trimming it too hard can kill it. </p>

<p> If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the problem is confined to those three species of tree, I will happily tell him about a problem in my constituency. Indeed, the problem is not always a hedge directly against someone's boundary. My constituency case concerns a house in a green lane. The hedge on the other side of the lane is a mixture of species. It has grown to about 30 or 40 ft, and completely blocks the light because of the angle of the land. I have visited the couple involved, who would not find redress if the restrictions proposed by the hon. Gentleman were accepted.</p>

<p> I am grateful for that intervention. I shall come to the issue of light being blocked in a moment. The hon. Gentleman said that the hedge was a mixture of species; the most common species in most hedges is thorn, which is not evergreen. Bearing in mind the enormity of the problem, I would want the three species in question to be dealt with first; it may then be possible, by order, to extend the proposal to other species.</p>
<p> I tend to follow the line taken by some of my hon. Friends that the measure should not be all-encompassing. I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight what would happen when a hedge that had been planted properly and had not caused a nuisance was deemed to be a barrier to light in a development built after it was planted. Would retrospective legislation be required? I had such a case in Northleach in my constituency: someone innocently planted a hedge next to an agricultural field. It was not a problem to anyone at the time, but new houses were built and a constituent has written to me saying that the hedge now is a problem. That possibility should be addressed; perhaps an amendment with a retrospective element is needed. </p>

<p> Does my hon. Friend accept that it is likely that such a hedge would require permission subsequent to the construction of the houses concerned? Does he accept, too, that it is also likely that if the person were growing the hedge for the purpose of providing a barrier he would seek planning permission when he sold the land? I accept that there is a lacuna in the measure, which Ministers could plug at a later stage, in respect of houses built after the growth of a hedge on a site that had not been in the ownership of the person growing the hedge.</p>

<p> I hear what my hon. Friend says, but I do not want to get too bound up in the argument. I am not being churlish about the new clause; I am merely pointing out what needs to be considered when the Government draft legislation.</p>
<p> On the issue of light, the amendment does not define a barrier to light, and a definition is needed. The Building Research Establishment has issued some excellent guidelines on the subject, which deal with the matter raised by the hon. Member for Ludlow. As he said, a house 1 m away from a hedge is in a very different situation from one that is 40 or 50 m away; the same hedge can cause different problems, depending on the angle of the light and the height of the hedge. There are different problems in the winter and the summer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet said, whether the hedge is on the north or the south side of a house is also important. The matter has been considered in some detail in the BRE guidelines, which should, at the very least, be incorporated into any proposed measure. </p>
<p> Hedge roots, too, create difficulties. As every surveyor knows, hedge roots can cause problems of subsidence, and get into the drains of neighbouring houses. Hedge roots like drains, which provide them with the nutrients that they need to grow even faster, so hedges whose roots find their way into someone's drains are likely to become an even greater problem. </p>
<p> There are lots of matters that need to be dealt with, such as who is to hear appeals, what sanctions are available when the legislation is not complied with, and so on. I have identified some of them, but there will be others. I join my hon. Friend in urging the Government to act on the matter. About 10,000 people are already affected, and if there is to be a reasonable level of house building, which we need, that </p>
<p> number will grow rapidly. Indeed, if the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's guidelines are to allow the density of housing to increase, I suspect that the problem will become even greater. This is a pressing matter and I hope that the Government will deal with it. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is in danger of sitting on the fence&mdash;or should I say the hedge? Will he make clear whether he supports me in my belief that the Bill is appropriate legislation for the Government to use to introduce suitable clauses on Report to deal with this question?</p>
</speech>

<p> That is a matter for the Government; it is their Bill. The Opposition merely say that the Government should find the first legislative opportunity. The matter would clearly be within the scope of the Bill, or the Clerk would not have selected the new clause. I simply say that it is an urgent problem, which needs to be dealt with at the earliest opportunity. If the Government can prepare an appropriate new clause in time for Report, and get it through the other place, they should use this opportunity. However, this is a complex subject and I suspect that it will be difficult to deal with in the Bill, so it will probably need separate legislation.</p>
<p> The thrust of the speeches from the Opposition Benches is that the Government need to do something, and I hope that something will be included in the Queen's Speech. I cannot be any clearer than that. </p>

<p> I see that have only a few minutes to respond to the debate. I shall answer as many points as I can, but we may need to return to the debate this afternoon. I strongly support the intention behind new clause 1. We were extremely disappointed by the failure of the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North. Only a small minority of Opposition Members opposed it; otherwise, the issue has cross-party support.</p>

<p> I wish to correct the Minister. It was not only Opposition Members who opposed that Bill. The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) tabled a large number of amendments, which delayed our discussion of the Bill on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p> As the hon. Gentleman will know, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon supported the Bill. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of exactly what was going on when the Bill was discussed on those Fridays. I was about to give his party credit for the fact that the majority of Conservative Members supported the Bill, so it was a little churlish of him to try to cast aspersions on the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon.</p>
<p> In the short time since I took responsibility for this matter, it has been my experience that one requires considerable persistence and ingenuity to make progress. Many Members in the House and in the other place have shown that persistence and that ingenuity by continuing to raise the subject, and they do so because constituents continue to raise it with us. The problem makes people's lives a misery, especially those who live next to a house with huge high hedge, classically a leylandii hedge, as it can leer over the garden wall&mdash;some are double the height of the house&mdash;and can block light, and the view. As a result, and given the failure of the private Member's Bill, we have given much consideration to what we could to. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for Cotswold said that he had considered tabling my hon. Friend's entire Bill as an amendment to this Bill. We, too, considered that. </p>

<p> I suggested that idea to the Government, who said that they would consider the idea carefully.</p>

<p> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have done. However, using my hon. Friend's Bill would raise problems of scope. We also considered whether other ways might be found to include such provisions, in order to address the many problems that hon. Members have raised, but they too would have created all sorts of difficulties&mdash;</p>
