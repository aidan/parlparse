<p> Amendment No. 565 follows logically from the thrust of my argument on the other amendments, especially No. 564.</p>
<p> It is reasonable to build in a period of notice in the event that an accreditation is removed during a course of study leading up to an examination or qualification. It is also reasonable that where accreditation is removed during a course of study, the costs should be borne by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority rather than by the awarding body, school or educational institution that is involved in teaching that course of study. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 566 is designed to probe the Minister's intentions behind the broad rights of entry in the provisions that extend as far as allowing unfettered rights of entry when determining a reasonable fee. Subsection (2) should be deleted, thereby constraining the powers of entry to a certain extent. Although inspectors could enter the premises of an awarding body to satisfy themselves that the appropriate standards were being maintained in relation to the award or authentication of a qualification, they could not enter and have unfettered access to the awarding body's accounts and confidential papers. </p>
<p> It seems extreme to take powers to allow the QCA powers of entry to crawl all over the books of an awarding body to decide an appropriate fee for a qualification. That suggests that the Government believe that we are moving towards a single awarding body rather than several competing awarding bodies that can keep the fee under control through normal competition in the marketplace. We shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments. </p>

<p> I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) in these proposals, particularly in so far as they are designed to probe the Government's intentions regarding competition between examining bodies and any intention they may have either of maintaining standards or of driving down prices by unifying the examining board as is the case in Scotland.</p>
<p> The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills will be aware of cases that I have brought to his attention concerning the Edexcel examining board&mdash;in particular, its history syllabus 9267. I thank him for his responses to the concerns of my constituents and of the staff at Carisbrooke high school in my constituency who have had extraordinary difficulties with the board. </p>
<p> Thirty-six of the school's students took the history exam at advanced level in June 2001. If it is any comfort to my hon. Friend, I may tell him that I obtained a grade E in A-level history&mdash;it was, of course, much more difficult then. The pupils got worse results than expected, but most of them got good results in politics, which was taught by the same teacher. They launched an appeal on 19 August and were told that they would receive a reply within 20 to 30 working days. After 59 days, no response had been received. During that time, candidates of course suffer the danger of having their university applications rejected and their places given to someone else. </p>
<p> The lesson here is the inability of Ministers, despite their best endeavours, to offer any comfort. The Minister said that his officials had been in touch with the Joint Council for General Qualifications and he understood that the report on appeals would not be coming out until March 2002; that it would not contain the information that parents wanted; and that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''It is at the discretion of Edexcel to make such information public and I have been advised that they have no plans to do so''.</span></p>
<p> That seems extraordinary. I recall that when Sir Keith Joseph was Secretary of State the only power he had over examining bodies was to sign the certificates at O-level and A-level. On the back of that, he was able to introduce GCSEs. The lesson that some would draw is that we must have a single examining body under state control. That is not my conclusion&mdash;and I am glad to see the Minister shaking his head&mdash;because the clear message from Mary Hoather, the head teacher at the school, in her letter of 17 January to the chief executive of Edexcel is </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Clearly our frustration and anger has made us change examination board for our history examinations in future and is making us consider seriously for other subjects''.</span></p>
<p> In other words, the market is working. It would work a great deal better if there were not only three examination boards for England. It would work better still were people able to recognise openly that the standards of some examining boards are slightly higher than others. </p>
<p> I remember from my schooldays our slight criticism of those who took Associated Examining Board examinations rather than Oxford and Cambridge examinations, because we felt the standards were not the same. I am sure that that was recognised also by higher and further education institutions. I do not agree that there is competition to drive down standards, as long as there is transparency about which board issued the certificates. I hope that the Minister will assure me that there is no agenda to unify the examination under state control as has so lamentably happened in Scotland. </p>

<p> May I take this opportunity for the last time to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Pike. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) shared his history grade with the Committee: that might explain his distorted view of the previous Government's record&mdash;[Laughter.]&mdash;or perhaps not.</p>
<p> The comments on Edexcel underline the importance of the relationship between the QCA and the examination boards. The impact that such events have on students and their families is traumatic and stressful, and we should not understate the effect on those individuals. However, we should not exaggerate the problem and give the impression that the examination system is on the verge of collapse. If serious mistakes are made in a couple of examination situations, we have a responsibility to maintain an appropriate, balanced reaction. </p>
<p> Edexcel experienced difficulties during the curriculum 2000 reforms. The Government responded by asking the QCA to audit that examination board, and to report on the reasons for those weaknesses and failings. That report will be published soon, and will be a public document. MPs and others will be able to examine the reasons for those difficulties and the QCA's recommendations for putting them right. </p>
<p> The QCA has placed its head of quality assurance at Edexcel, to ensure that performance improves immediately. It is important that none of the mistakes be repeated when students take their exams in the summer. Committee members were right to express concern, but we should have a proportionate, responsible response. The conclusion that we make about the difficulties of one examination board should not lead us to believe that the best solution is to create a monopoly provider. That is not the Government's position. </p>
<p> It is appropriate to have choice and diversity, but we cannot tolerate too many failures of the kind that have occurred. It is important that the QCA use its powers. The amendments concern the relationship </p>
<p> between the QCA and the examination boards. That underlines the importance of the QCA's role as a regulator of the performance and standards of the examination boards, and its powers of intervention when mistakes are made. </p>
<p> Most of the amendments have reasonable objectives, although they are not necessary or desirable. Amendment No. 560 would remove the paragraph enabling the QCA to devise and apply criteria that would limit the number of qualifications in similar subjects or functions that it accredits. We consider that paragraph very important. We intend to have a robust and transparent framework of worthwhile qualifications that can be easily understood by users and the general public. </p>
<p> It is also important that learning and training needs in that context are fully addressed. Equally importantly, public choice and confidence may well be improved if the number of qualifications is reduced, and the unnecessary overlap and duplication in provision is eliminated. We believe that it is a sensible power to give the QCA when the qualifications framework is not actually supporting the objectives of raising standards and making things clear for students, when it is confusing, when it is unwieldy and when there is unnecessary duplication. We believe that it is appropriate to ensure that the QCA can intervene in those circumstances to streamline and rationalise in a reasonable way. We believe that the majority of people would support its having that reasonable power. </p>
<p> Over the past two years, the QCA has undertaken a substantial programme of accrediting qualifications up to and including level 3. It has accredited more than 3,000 qualifications. In many areas, we have the qualifications that we need, but there is a doubt about whether the QCA and its sister regulatory authorities can legally deny accreditation to qualifications that may otherwise be sound but may unnecessarily increase provision in particular subjects. If we are to avoid an undesirable proliferation of qualifications, it is important that the QCA should be able to have the power and the criteria to deal specifically with the issue of excessive numbers of qualifications. For that reason, we do not believe that amendment No. 562, which would replace ''excessive'' with ''reasonable'', would be helpful. </p>

<p> Is the Minister saying that amendment No. 562&mdash;which, as I said, was originally drafted to replace ''excessive'' with ''unreasonable''&mdash;is unnecessary because the word ''excessive'', as used in this clause, equates to the word ''unreasonable''?</p>

<p> Yes. I think that the objective is the same. We would argue that there is no need to substitute the word in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p>
<p> Amendment No. 561 would reduce flexibility and could lead to perverse results in terms of what the QCA may want to achieve. As drafted, it would enable the QCA to limit the qualification types in which a particular subject is available, but not the number of qualifications in that subject. I think that the hon. </p>
<p> Gentleman would, on reflection, agree that such a change would not help us to achieve our goal of ensuring that there is not a proliferation of qualifications that are difficult to understand for candidates, teachers and employers. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2001-12-11_G_18-0_2002-01-24a.4.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/749" speakername="Graham Brady" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmstand/g/st020124/pm/20124s02.htm" colnum="619">
<p> Does the Minister not agree that what is important for the transparency of qualifications and the ability of parents, employers and others to understand their value, is the rigour of the qualification itself, rather than the precise content of the curriculum in that subject? I am slightly concerned that the drift of his argument appears to be that it would be worrying to have a GCSE in the history of ancient Rome parallel to one on Carthaginian studies. The subject matter is surely less important. There should be that variety and choice of subject matter. Is not the legitimate goal of the QCA to ensure that the standard of those qualifications is rigorous and transparent to those who need to know?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2001-12-11_G_18-0_2002-01-24a.4.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1044" speakername="Ivan Lewis" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmstand/g/st020124/pm/20124s02.htm" colnum="619">
<p> I agree that that is central to the role of the QCA, but I am sure the hon. Gentleman would also agree that we do not want an unnecessary proliferation of qualifications, because that just leads to confusion. Yes, the primary responsibility of the QCA is to safeguard the rigour and standards of qualifications. That is absolutely central and it is particularly relevant, for example, in the context of the introduction of new GCSEs in vocational subjects, to be staged over two years, starting this September.</p>
<p> We believe, in the context of our 14 to 19 policy, that if we are to achieve parity of esteem for what has always been described as vocational education, it will be essential that the content of the qualifications&mdash;the rigour&mdash;is every bit as strong and respected as that of equivalent academic qualifications. We will work with the QCA to ensure that that is the case in the future. That will be a central part of what we are saying about wanting to give more young people more opportunities in what has been described as vocational education. I think that we would all agree that we have not in the past succeeded in making vocational education work in this country, and if it is now to work and be effective, the robustness, quality and credibility of the qualifications will be absolutely essential, so I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about the QCA's general responsibilities in those areas. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2001-12-11_G_18-0_2002-01-24a.4.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/749" speakername="Graham Brady" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmstand/g/st020124/pm/20124s02.htm" colnum="619">
<p> I am grateful to the Minister and pleased that he accepts that point. By way of illustration, could he give us an idea of the kind of overlap or duplication that he thinks would be unnecessary or unwelcome in terms of subject matter, so that we can see how Ministers might envisage these criteria being used to limit the number of different subjects being offered within a qualification?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2001-12-11_G_18-0_2002-01-24a.4.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1044" speakername="Ivan Lewis" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmstand/g/st020124/pm/20124s02.htm" colnum="619">
<p> If the Bill is enacted, it will be the role of the QCA to make those judgments. One example would be if we had 10 virtually identical qualifications but they were badged or branded slightly differently, leading to unnecessary confusion and a lack of clarity about what each qualification actually meant. That would not be efficient or lead to the kind of credible, transparent system that we want to create. We want to give the QCA reasonable powers, as the body that is</p>
<p> charged with those responsibilities, to make credible and reasonable decisions. I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman is so concerned about seeking to limit the QCA's capacity to take such decisions. That is one of the reasons that the QCA exists in the form that it does.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2001-12-11_G_18-0_2002-01-24a.4.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/749" speakername="Graham Brady" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmstand/g/st020124/pm/20124s02.htm" colnum="620">
<p> I am not concerned about trying to limit the QCA's role, I am concerned to know why the Minister is so keen to extend its role in this way, why he believes these criteria need to be available and in what circumstances they would be used. The example that he gave, that there may be 10 qualifications all differently branded but rather similar, seemed to suggest that he was referring to types of qualification, rather than subjects, and that his concern was that there could be a City and Guilds, a BTEC and perhaps something else, all in relatively similar subject areas. He has not actually given any indication of where he believes the subject areas covered by qualifications may be too close and would need to be altered in the way that the Bill provides.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2001-12-11_G_18-0_2002-01-24a.4.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1044" speakername="Ivan Lewis" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmstand/g/st020124/pm/20124s02.htm" colnum="620">
<p> It is clearly possible that those circumstances will arise in future, so it makes sense to give the QCA the power to deal with them. I see no risk in giving the QCA the ability to take reasonable management decisions in that regard.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2001-12-11_G_18-0_2002-01-24a.4.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" speakername="Andrew Turner" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmstand/g/st020124/pm/20124s02.htm" colnum="620">
<p> May I illustrate the point? The word ''branded'' was used, which will lead us astray if we are not careful. There are three examination boards, each of which offers a history syllabus. The brand is the name of the board, not the name of the syllabus. The badge is the name of the syllabus, which might be ''History, 20th Century''. All three boards may offer broadly the same syllabus but with different brands. I hope that the QCA will not try to prevent the offer of the same syllabus with different brands. It might try to prevent the offer of differently badged but similar syllabuses by the same board. Is that correct?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2001-12-11_G_18-0_2002-01-24a.4.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1044" speakername="Ivan Lewis" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmstand/g/st020124/pm/20124s02.htm" colnum="620">
<p> Yes, that is the point. Many bodies do not issue generic qualifications; they issue individual qualifications. As he is probably aware, there are 98 awarding bodies largely offering vocational qualifications. That reinforces the point that it makes sense to give the QCA the power, where appropriate, to rationalise the situation sensibly and responsibly if it becomes confusing for students, employers and others for whom it is important to get the provisions right. That is all that we seek to do. We expect the QCA to exercise reasonable judgment, and overall it has a good track record.</p>
<p> The changes that we are making through schedule 18 are designed to provide clarification and make changes to the powers of the QCA that are in line with the legislation's original intention. Amendment No. 563 proposes a significant change by removing the QCA's ability to make a charge for accreditation work. The QCA has not considered that and does not propose to do so now, but there may be circumstances in which it is necessary to reconsider the position. It is therefore important that the QCA retain that power. </p>
<p> On amendments Nos. 564 and 565, I appreciate the concern that the QCA might impose conditions post-</p>
<p> accreditation unreasonably and that that might detrimentally affect the awarding bodies' cost base or economic viability. However, I believe that that concern is not well founded. As I said, we expect the QCA to carry out its functions reasonably and to take soundly based decisions. Indeed, as a statutory body, it must legally act reasonably. In doing so, we expect the QCA to take account of the costs of any conditions that are intended to support policy developments. </p>
<p> The QCA is also expected to consult the relevant awarding body before imposing any post-accreditation conditions. As a matter of administrative law, it is bound to do so. However, it would be highly undesirable to impose an arbitrary time bar for a condition that may result from the need to address a problem in the delivery of a qualification that is uncovered during post-accreditation monitoring. That is an example of where the power may be necessary. In those circumstances, urgent action may be required if the learner's best interests are to be served. </p>
<p> Equally, it would not be appropriate to require the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to pay systematically for the implementation of those changes. It is difficult to predict the conditions that the QCA may want to impose post-accreditation rather than waiting until the qualifications come forward for re-accreditation. I am sure that the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West will agree that if the conditions work to remedy weaknesses in an awarding body, it would be inappropriate for the QCA to pick up the tab. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 566 would remove the proposed change that would give the QCA the right of entry to premises to inspect and copy documents in connection with its power to limit an exam fee. The QCA already has a right of entry, but only in particular circumstances. The current legislation gives the QCA the right of entry only to ensure that standards in qualifications are being maintained. It was an oversight in the original legislation to provide the QCA with a power to limit an exam fee but not with the means of obtaining evidence to help it to take a well-founded decision, and paragraph 4 will remedy that. It is a power that would be used only as a last resort, but it is important. </p>
<p> Despite the recent difficulties, the QCA and the awarding bodies generally have a good working relationship, and it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which the power would be needed. However, the Committee must ask itself whether, as we are giving the QCA the power to enter to maintain qualification standards, it would be consistent not to give it the right to obtain the necessary evidence on exam fees.

<p> I am considering what to do. I started by saying that the group of amendments was intended to probe the Government's thinking and intentions. I am glad that we tabled the amendments, because they have prompted a useful exchange. The Minister was</p>
<p> good enough to say that he thought that the amendments were reasonable and that he had some sympathy with the apparent objectives. It is not altogether surprising therefore that his response was not entirely convincing.</p>
<p> We have established that there is some uncertainty in the intentions of this part of the Bill, and it is not clear how the powers may be used in future. We seem to have moved to and fro on the limitation of the number of qualifications that will be on offer, between one concerning the nature of the qualification or the brand or badge that it carries and one that applies to the subject matter or curriculum. That highlighted a weakness in the Government's thinking, and Ministers should reflect further on that, and attempt to give greater clarity to the bodies concerned. </p>
<p> In responding to amendment No. 561, the Minister was good enough to agree that the primary responsibility of the QCA is to safeguard the rigour of the qualifications. It is a necessary reserve power that he anticipated would not be used that often. He was helpful and concise on amendment No. 562 in confirming that the definition that applied to the word ''excessive'' should be the same as that applied to the word ''unreasonable''. That will help those who are affected by the legislation. </p>
<p> On amendment No. 563, the Minister said that these were reserve powers that were not likely to be used very often. When discussing amendments Nos. 564 and 565, he said that a notice period should not be required because there may be a need to act quickly. I accept that, but I hope that Ministers will consider whether guidance might be given that would encourage the maximum notice to be given if these powers are to be used. </p>
<p> On amendment No. 565 and the question of who should bear costs, the Minister said that if an awarding body was at fault, it was unreasonable to expect the QCA to cover the costs. However, accreditation might be removed for reasons other than the fault of the awarding body. The QCA may have changed its approach and revised its expectations of awarding bodies, and in certain circumstances it may be appropriate to expect the costs to be covered. I ask him to reflect on that. Helpfully, he said that the new power in paragraph 4(2) allowing rights of entry to establish whether fee levels are feasible was envisaged as a power of last resort. </p>
<p> Again, Ministers may be able to give greater certainty to the awarding bodies about the procedure that might be undergone before the QCA might have recourse to that power of last resort. Certainly it could legitimately expect that in ordinary circumstances it could supply information requested by the QCA and have it taken at face value. Ministers may be able to find a way to resolve that problem. </p>
<p> I am not entirely satisfied by the Minister's responses on these amendments, but in the light of his comments and our useful exchange, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. </p>
<p> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. </p>
<p> Schedule 18 agreed to. </p>

<p> May I also for the last time welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Pike? I am sure that when you and I attend the next works outing we will have many happy reminiscences of our time in Committee Room 10.</p>
<p> This clause is intended to clarify the legal position of local education authorities in England and Wales that engage in the award or authentication of educational qualifications. It makes specific provision for LEAs to develop, deliver and award qualifications and to charge a fee for those services. It also enables LEAs to make arrangements with other persons and form, participate in or be members of a body corporate to exercise these powers. The clause applies those provisions retrospectively so that there will be no doubt that LEAs that have exercised them hitherto have done so lawfully. As the provisions are for clarification, they do not limit any existing powers of LEAs. </p>

<p> This minor change ensures that the order in which schedule 11 appears on the list of schedules to the Bill matches the order in which the relevant clauses give effect to them. Clause 189 gives effect to schedule 11. The change will have no legal or policy effect. Currently, schedule 11 appears before schedules 12 to 18. According to convention, however, it should appear after them, as they are given effect by clauses that precede clause 189. </p>

<p> My question relates to subsections (4) and (5). Will the Minister clarify what ''qualifying material'' means? I take it that it is not material that is specified verbatim by the National Assembly, but material that fulfils purposes outlined by it. In those circumstances, it is interesting that subsection (5) states:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''No material published or provided under this section may name any individual to whom it relates.''</span></p>
<p> If parents are choosing a school for their children, one thing that may interest them is who the head teacher is.

<p> I can help the hon. Gentleman. The clause provides for local education authorities and governing bodies of LEA-maintained schools in Wales to publish material provided to them by the National Assembly, which is designed to help parents to gain a broader understanding of the performance of schools in their communities. The ''qualifying material'' referred to in the clause will include public examination results and outcomes of national curriculum assessments.</p>
<p> The clause enables the qualifying material to be put in context by the inclusion of value-added indicators and benchmark data that reflect the socio-economic conditions that prevail in different communities and different parts of Wales. The intention is that any information that the National Assembly requires LEAs or governing bodies to publish under the new power will first be checked by each school concerned. </p>

<p> The clause appears to be very widely drawn and allows the National Assembly for Wales to alter completely the balance of responsibilities between school governing bodies and local education authorities from the settlement in the Education Reform Act 1988 that was substantially re-enacted in the Education Act 1996 and the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. My remarks may relate better to the next clause, but may save us debating that clause. The clause will also alter the power of parents to express a choice of school for their children. Will the Minister clarify whether the powers have the effect that I fear they have?</p>

<p> I refer to my remarks on the previous clause, in which I stressed the importance of giving information so that parents can make proper choices about where their children are educated. The clause enables the National Assembly to make regulations that require any LEA in Wales to enter into a partnership agreement with the governing body of each school maintained by that authority, or each school of a prescribed class. The agreements will be about how the LEA and the governing body of a school discharge their functions in relation to the school in such matters that may be prescribed and other matters that the LEA and the governing body may agree should be prescribed. It is necessary to sustain and enhance existing partnership working between the LEA and the schools maintained by that authority in that way, so that both parties can work together effectively to promote high standards of education in those schools.</p>
<p> We envisage that the partnership agreements will set out the procedures that the LEAs and schools should adopt to establish agreed common objectives for pupils' educational progress, the actions that the authority will take in exercising its functions, such as visits by advisory staff, and action to be taken to ease the transition of pupils between phases of education and schools. The regulations may provide for review of the agreement and for a deadline by which the LEA or governing body may comply with any requirement imposed by the clause. The clause also enables the LEA to draw up a statement setting out how it and the governing body will discharge their respective functions in relation to the school if neither party is able to reach an agreement. </p>

<p> That explanation is certainly helpful, but it would assist me if the Minister would consider an example. Let us say that the LEA would like to have a firmer agreement about the redeployment of redundant teachers than is possible under the current legislation, although we know that schools, not LEAs, are responsible for the appointment of teaching staff. The LEA canvasses the views of Members of the National Assembly, which requires LEAs to enter into a partnership with their governing bodies.</p>
<p> The purpose of the partnership arrangement is that matters such as facilitating the redeployment of redundant teachers may be prescribed. Some schools object on the grounds that they do not want others' cast-offs, but the LEA may be closing several schools and is determined that it will be less expensive. Most schools in the area do not have any vacancies for teachers and so do not fear the consequences. Most of the schools are able to reach an agreement with the LEA, for the purpose of subsection (1), but one or two schools may not. The LEA then draws up a statement that sets out how they will discharge their respective functions, and governing bodies accept redeployment staff who are available in the LEA. Does the clause permit that? </p>

<p> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the clause sets out only how LEAs and governing bodies carry out their functions. It does not alter their functions. It cannot change the law through the power, and so could not change any of their responsibilities in relation to staffing.</p>

<p> I have a question about proposed new subsection 512ZA(2) on page 117, which says:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''A local authority shall charge every person the same price for the same quantity of the same item''.</span></p>
<p> That sounds admirable. In some schools, teachers are provided with lunch free of charge in return either for specific duties or an agreement to undertake lunchtime supervision or other activities. Would that be forbidden by the clause? Similarly, would it be forbidden for schools to offer lunches to old people in the local community at either a reduced charge or the market rate? </p>

<p> I want to raise another example that might be important under this clause and on which I would welcome the Minister's reassurance. Might it be sensible and appropriate in various circumstances for a larger quantity of certain foods to be offered at the same price? I shall not detain the Committee for long with this anecdote, but when I was at university there was a dispute in my college over the amount of food available to students. The principal at the time, a splendid lady named Irene Hindmarsh, made the memorable suggestion to the junior common room that we should always sit next to a person of the opposite sex, on the premise that a larger male sitting next to a smaller female might have some of the food that the girl did not want. I am sure that many beautiful relationships began as a result.</p>
<p> A more prosaic example in the context of a school is where a class has been out on the playing fields on a cold winter's morning and a well-meaning dinner lady gives a little extra food to those in need of sustenance. It would be unfortunate if an over-prescriptive clause were to prevent such a common-sense act of kindness. </p>

<p> I look forward to the hon. Gentleman moving on Report an amendment based on his JCR experiences.</p>
<p> The clause replaces section 512 of the Education Act 1996, which allows LEAs to provide and charge for meals, milk and other refreshments to prescribed persons receiving education. Changes to other legislation have made the original intentions less clear than they were. Some aspects of the legislation are at risk of becoming unworkable. The changes to the benefits and tax credits system have changed the background to these measures. </p>
<p> The Bill provides for an order-making power to allow the Secretary of State to add to the benefits allowances or tax credits that would entitle a child to receive a free school lunch. The Secretary of State can limit eligibility to families in receipt of particular tax credits by reference to their income level. I am glad to tell the Committee that the Secretary of State has agreed that those children who would have lost their entitlement to free school meals because of the changes proposed by the Treasury to the tax credit system will have their entitlement protected. We will adjust the free school meal eligibility criteria to secure free school meals for all children who currently receive them, and for others in similar circumstances in the future. The entitlement of about 100,000 children will be protected, and the changes will bring about the </p>
<p> extension of free school meal entitlement to an additional 89,000 children in England and Wales. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General is now announcing that news to the Committee considering the Tax Credits Bill, not far from here. </p>
<p> The concerns expressed by Opposition Members about further changes are not warranted. The school can pay the cost of teachers' lunches. That is the current basis on which teachers are provided with free lunches, and nothing in the Bill will change that. That will also be true of meals given to visitors: the example of elderly people was cited. The Bill creates a new power for school governors to provide services to the community. Opposition Members need not be concerned that anything is lost in the arrangements; in fact, there are significant gains. </p>

<p> I have a small but significant point to make. I did not pick up one particular assurance from the Minister.

<p> The amendment is purely technical. It relates to a power under section 218 of the Education Reform Act 1988, which is being repealed and re-enacted in the clause. The clause simply provides legal reinforcement for further education institutions to share records with other providers. The amendment ensures that the powers are complete. By virtue of the amendment, </p>
<p> regulations can, for example, place specific obligations on governing bodies of further education colleges to keep and share records. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will accept it. </p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 298, in page 120, line 34, leave out from 'education' to end of line 37.</p>
<p> This is a drafting amendment to remove the definition of further education from the clause. Such a definition is redundant because the clause applies only to primary and secondary education. The clause replaces the existing provisions that regulate payments between local education authorities. It is intended that, as now, the regulations will affect payments only for certain categories of pupils receiving education in a different authority from the one to which they belong. From April 2002, further education will be funded by the Learning and Skills Council, not by LEAs, so the clause does not apply to further education and the definition is not required. </p>

<p> On a point of order, I wonder whether we might have some clarification. Amendment No. 463, which I did not move, appears also on our selection list as Government amendment No. 463, which the Minister has apparently moved formally. Can you elucidate whether the fact that I did not move it or the fact that the Minister did takes precedent?</p>

<p> I should like to make a few remarks before we formally report the Bill to the House. On behalf of the entire Committee, I wish to express our thanks to you, Mr. Griffiths, and to Mrs. Adams, whom we have not seen for a few weeks. Between you, you guided our deliberations with great skill, and we are grateful to you for bringing us successfully to this point in our deliberations.</p>
<p> I also thank the Clerks and all those who have worked with the Committee: the Hansard reporters, the police, the messengers and others. I wish to thank my officials, who have worked extremely hard over a long period&mdash;a good deal longer than we have&mdash;and who will continue to work on the Bill for some time to come. I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, who shared much of the load on the Front Bench with great skill, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, who ensured that the interests of Wales were promoted and safeguarded throughout our deliberations. </p>
<p> My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell), played an influential role off as well as on the record. The contributions of my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker) have not been recorded in Hansard but have been none the less considerable. I also wish to thank all my other hon. Friends, whose contributions have been distinguished more by their quality than their quantity. I want to express my thanks to them for their forbearance. </p>
<p> I also thank Opposition Members. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West contributed in a courteous and measured manner, which has helped the Committee, and only rarely gave vent to bouts of indignation. I also thank his colleagues on the Front Bench. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) made contributions characterised by vigour and commitment, which the Committee appreciated, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) will pass on those sentiments. We have also appreciated the well-informed and warm banter between the hon. Member for Isle of Wight and his good friends in the Liberal Democrat party. That has entertained us a great deal. </p>
<p> The Bill will raise standards, especially in secondary education. We shall realise our ambition for a modern and effective secondary system that commands the confidence of every community in the country. All Committee members will receive an invitation from the all-party group on children, chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), who is organising a performance by children linked to NCH Action for Children to convey their views about secondary education. That will be on 7 February, and may be of interest to hon. Members. I thank Committee members for their interest and commitment, and I conclude by thanking you again, Mr. Pike, for steering us successfully to a conclusion. </p>

<p> I know that the Minister will be reassured to learn that I remain indignant&mdash;I am just not showing it. We have concluded the Committee stage in a better manner than we began it. I am pleased that we were able, albeit at a late hour, to convey the importance of proper scrutiny. We are grateful that the Government acceded to a request for more time on Report, in recognition of those parts of the Bill that were not sufficiently scrutinised in Committee because of timetable constraints.</p>
<p> On behalf of myself, and my hon. Friends in Her Majesty's Opposition, I thank you, Mr. Pike, and your colleagues in the Chair who have assisted us. I thank the Clerks and the other staff of the House whose services have been invaluable and unfailing. I also thank officials who have been helpful in ensuring that Opposition Members receive answers to questions that Ministers cannot supply off the top of their heads. I particularly thank my hon. Friends, who have been unstinting in their service, and constant in their attendance. Today is a slight exception because one is unwell, and another is speaking in Westminster Hall shortly. </p>
<p> I also thank our friends, in this context, from the Liberal Democrats. We have found surprising amounts of common ground, which should give pause for thought to Ministers and make them a little worried. Despite our differences, on matters of substance regarding the Bill and on procedural matters, we have enjoyed good-natured debates. I am grateful to the Ministers, who have contributed to that, and their colleagues on the Government Benches. Finally, Mr. Pike, I renew my thanks to you for your courteous and helpful chairmanship. </p>

<p> May I convey the apologies of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough for not attending the end of the proceedings. Unfortunately, he had to attend an important meeting in his constituency about the rail crisis, but a rail strike prevented him from getting there and he had to leave the Committee early. We have also enjoyed the proceedings and are grateful to the Ministers for the reasonable way in which they dealt with Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members' inquiries. We also thank you, Mr. Pike, and the other Chairmen of the Committee, and the officials and others who were involved in the proceedings. We enjoyed the opportunity to debate fundamental issues of principle, and less fundamental issues about schools at risk of falling into the sea and other matters, which were also important to consider.</p>
<p> We have learned several important lessons that we will pass on to those who focus on the targeting strategy of the Liberal Democrats at the next general election, and I am sure that the Isle of Wight will receive even closer attention than usual. I say that in the nicest possible way, and we look forward to further proceedings of the Bill. </p>

<p> Those comments are traditionally made at the end of a sitting and are almost out of order, although the Chairman never rules them out of order. I will pass them on to the other Chairmen of the Committee. This is the first time that I have chaired a Committee, and I have enjoyed it, although the first</p>
<p> sitting was a little tiring. However, I warn the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills that if he keeps referring to Manchester City and its relationship to Burnley in future sittings, I might jump on him quickly. If Burnley does not reverse its table position by the end of the season, I hope that we will repeat 1946&ndash;47, the first year after the war, when City went up as champions from the second division and Burnley were runners-up.</p>
<p> To conclude, when some hon. Members discussed history this afternoon, it reminded me that when I started school we learned in air raid shelters, so that what for some people were current affairs are now history. </p>
<p> Question put and agreed to. </p>
<p> Bill, as amended, to be reported. </p>
<p> Committee rose at four minutes to Four o'clock. </p>
