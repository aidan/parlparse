<p> I am delighted that we are finally, at least in this clause, discussing the role of commissioning. The Minister is aware of earlier exchanges during which regret was expressed at the fact that a great deal of this piece of legislation is designed to change structures and systems relating to the provision of service. This generally very welcome clause recognises the importance of commissioning, particularly local commissioning according to local decisions.</p>
<p> The amendments seek to examine more carefully the basis upon which commissioning decisions will be made. Proposed new section 16CA(1) does not give enough priority to the importance of first assessing local need and then commissioning services designed to meet it. Instead, it simply allows primary care trusts to judge what it is reasonable to commission. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain how that qualification, and the basis on which local commissioners have a duty to commission dental services, compare to the commissioning of other services by health authorities or their replacements under the National Health Service Act 1977. The comparison seems to be a fairly loose one, and it may be more appropriate to place a requirement in the Bill to deal with local need. </p>
<p> Dentistry, the provision of dental services and the level of public dental health vary considerably across the country. That variation is too great, which implies that there are pockets of great need. Commissioners may decide to increase the level of provision to a degree that they consider reasonable given all the circumstances. However, if that level comes nowhere near meeting the identified need, or if they do not take </p>
<p> steps to identify the needs of public dental health, health promotion, access to dental care, access to screening services and access to emergency and elective treatment, the commissioners may fall short. </p>
<p> In tabling amendment No. 635, the Liberal Democrats have the support of the Consumers Association, which requested that we raise the issue with the Government. It too recognises that access to dentistry is poor and that dental services are under great pressure in many areas. We have also heard from the British Dental Association that the share of funding for dentistry under the national arrangements has fallen from about 5 per cent. to nearer 3 per cent. of NHS spend. That constrains the ability of dental services to obtain sufficient resources to keep up with the level of need or demand, which is why the Committee and the Government have faced the problem of poor access to NHS dentistry. </p>
<p> Providing the ability for local commissioners to commission services and to be responsible for making contractual arrangements with providers&mdash;a matter to be dealt with in later clauses&mdash;is a sensible move away from a nationally negotiated and nationally organised system of contracting with dentists, and I support the Government in their intention. However, reference to need will be important. </p>
<p> We are concerned at the continuing failure to provide the ability for people to register with an NHS dentist. The Government made a limited pledge to ensure universal access to dentistry as much as possible. However, that really meant access in emergencies and did not result in people registering with dentists, as was the case before the drift away from NHS dentistry to private dentistry. </p>
<p> Primary care trusts should be required to identify the need for people to be registered with a dental practitioner, just as they register with a medical practitioner in primary care. Without that, there will not be the holistic and preventive care provided by dental practitioners that is an important part of dental health care, but simply a dental sickness service that deals with problems as they arise. There will not be the continuity of care that registration with an identified dental practitioner gives, and patients will not receive the advice that regular check-ups provide. Whether the practitioner is salaried or on a contract is immaterial; the question is whether that holistic care will exist. </p>
<p> If the Government were minded to look kindly on amendments Nos. 635 and 636 and consider the necessity to identify and cater for need, they would find that there was more pressure on local commissioners to ensure that they provided not just a holistic and preventive service, but one that was actually cost effective. If more dental disease were prevented by advice and appropriate evidence-based, effective screening techniques, and by dealing with problems early rather than in an emergency, the cost of dental care would ultimately be lower than if people were allowed to drift into problems that a firefighting system would rectify. </p>
<p> The wording of the clause is far too loose, because a PCT might consider it reasonable to maintain the current level of services and registrations. After all, the </p>
<p> Government consider that level to be adequate because they claim to have met their access pledge to dentistry. Members on both sides of the House know from their constituencies that current dental provision is simply inadequate, especially the levels of holistic and preventive work that I mentioned. The Government are running the risk of ensuring that commissioners continue to view dentistry and related care as a lower priority than other areas, and it is unreasonable to allow that to continue. </p>

<p> The Government have lived up to their 1999 pledge on dentistry, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that they have only partly done so, as they have fulfilled their pledge on emergency dentistry and but not on the bulk of dentistry care?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.4.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" speakername="Evan Harris" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s01.htm" colnum="845">
<p> Yes, the hon. Gentleman is agreeing with my earlier point that their pledge was limited in that it ensured greater access to only emergency treatment. Registration with dentists continues to fall, yet most people consider that good dental care involves the ability to register with a dentist, as one does with a GP, to ensure access to joined-up services, preventive work and advice on screening. The Government seem to want to provoke a firefighting mechanism by ensuring that there is a requirement only to provide access to emergency treatment or treatment when the patient deems it necessary, rather than encouraging the normal teamwork relationship between a patient and their registered dentist.</p>
<p> I hope that the Government have heard that point. I also hope that they recognise that the current wording is insufficient to safeguard the need to increase dentistry care. If PCTs argue that the current dental provision that the Government consider adequate&mdash;for which the access pledge has already been met&mdash;is acceptable, it would be reasonable not to seek to increase the degree of registration. </p>
<p> The clause does not recognise the degree of variation in dental services and in need. There is huge dental need in certain areas. It is important to debate whether other preventive measures, such as fluoridation, may be appropriate, but it is probably not fitting to do so during debates on this Bill. That whole debate is predicated on the unevenness of treatment. </p>
<p> The British Dental Association advised my colleagues and I on amendment No. 639, regarding the provision of specialist services. It is rather surprising that the British Dental Association, which has been involved closely with the Government in the negotiation of the contract and which, like us, generally supports these clauses, still has concerns. In tabling the amendment, I seek to clarify what specialist and special needs services will be available under the new system, because the Bill makes no specific provision for securing services for patients with special needs, who are among the most vulnerable people in our society. Dentists working in the community dental services have considerable experience in that area: they, and we, need assurance </p>
<p> that such care will continue to be provided and commissioned by primary care trusts under the new arrangements. </p>
<p> Similarly, patients who need orthodontic treatment and oral surgery must be assured that such services will be available in the future within a primary care setting. The General Dental Council, which regulates the profession, has recently set up specialist registers of those qualified to provide such services, and primary care trusts need to recognise the contribution that such specialists can make. </p>
<p> The Department of Health, through a supplement of the chief dental officer's digest from May 2003, states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''There will also be an opportunity to ensure that developing dental specialities are given the right incentives to contribute to patient care''.</span></p>
<p> Amendment No. 639 would seek to secure that. The Minister will know that access to orthodontics and oral surgery is poor. Waiting times for orthodontics were traditionally not measured under the Government's waiting time statistics inherited from the Conservatives, and, therefore, there were particularly long waiting times in that service, as there were for a few other services such as chiropody. Indeed, the term foot and mouth disease might well apply to the failure of the system to measure the waiting times in those specialities. Therefore, due to the priority given to meeting waiting time targets, dentistry, chiropody and some other areas have fallen through the net, and waiting times have become too long. </p>
<p> There are people with complex needs who often have significant other health needs of which oral health is a component. In particular, some patients with congenital disease require effective access to these services both in secondary care and in primary care settings, especially as more expertise develops in primary care and the Government seek rightly to shift services into primary care for reasons of quality and access. If the Government are going to be consistent in that, they must give an assurance that primary care trusts will have a duty not only to commission and secure the services that are currently available for these groups of people with special needs, but to improve those services. </p>
<p> We may be able to cover access to dentistry in other areas, so I will not go into detail on that because you, Mr. Chairman, may see fit to have a clause stand part debate. However, there are issues concerning access to dentistry for other parts of the population, and I hope that we will have an opportunity to debate at some point, though perhaps not under these detailed amendments, what the Government intend to do to secure better access to dentistry in prisons and detention centres, and for some other groups. </p>
<p> I hope that the Government will look kindly on this group of amendments. They are tabled in a constructive manner to seek to ensure that primary care trusts are given the incentives that they need to ensure that dentistry is no longer the Cinderella service that it has been under the current arrangements. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.4.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/767" speakername="Simon Burns" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s02.htm" colnum="847">
<p> I agree with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) that his amendments are a constructive way in which further information and guidance on the Government's intentions can be sought. I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to concerns, particularly as part 4 is an important and significant inclusion in primary legislation. To be accurate, the last work on this matter was done in 1977, so this is the first time in almost 30 years that a Government have taken a new approach to, and sought a greater insight into, the provision of dental services in this country.</p>
<p> It is apparent that since Nye Bevan set up the NHS in 1948, dental services have been a hybrid part of that service, and they have been greatly misunderstood by those who use them. In many ways Governments of all parties have used them as a whipping boy in the NHS, particularly when those Governments have experienced severe financial problems. That is why, by and large, the services have lost out. </p>
<p> I noticed that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon mentioned briefly the question of access to the NHS. I am not quite as optimistic as he seems to be, because the pledge that the Prime Minister gave at the 1999 Labour party conference was not that access through registration with a local dentist would be ensured, but that within two years anyone would be able to ring up NHS Direct and be told the location of an NHS dentist in their area. That is very different from registering with one of those dentists, and the matter must be looked at. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.4.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" speakername="Evan Harris" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s02.htm" colnum="847">
<p> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I thought that I had made it clear that the Government's pledge on access to treatment was limited only to the accessibility of NHS dentists, and that that is not equivalent to ensuring that registration rates, which have been falling for years, turn the corner. Without registration one does not get, as I mentioned, the holistic and preventive care that is so important in avoiding dental problems.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.4.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/767" speakername="Simon Burns" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s02.htm" colnum="847">
<p> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and as I am in a benign mood, I will go along with him and accept that that is what he said.</p>
<p> Apart from giving the Committee an opportunity to improve the Bill so that there can be no misunderstanding or lack of progress, the amendments, just as importantly, will flush out more of the Government's intentions. Amendment No. 635 refers to proposed new section 16CA(1) in clause 157, which basically states that a primary care trust will now have a vital and significant role in the commissioning and, in effect, the provision of dental services in its region. That is in keeping with the Government's professed aim to decentralise the health service and make it more accountable and responsive to the needs of local communities. I have no problem whatsoever with that principle, and I think that the sooner that politicians end their day-to-day interference in the provision of dental services and health care the better. </p>
<p> I am not, however, convinced that what the Government propose for other areas of the health service&mdash;I shall not expand on those so as not to fall </p>
<p> foul of the relevance rule&mdash;will decentralise services to the extent that Ministers maintain. New subsection (1) states that a PCT </p>
<p><span class="indent">''must, to the extent that it considers it reasonable to do so, provide primary dental services''.</span></p>
<p> The amendment seeks to remove the words: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''to the extent that it considers it reasonable to do so''.</span></p>
<p> I do not understand why the Government have put that phrase in the Bill, because there is a danger that it will allow the status quo partly to continue under a different commissioning and provision regime. </p>
<p> What exactly does </p>
<p><span class="indent">''considers it reasonable to do so''</span></p>
<p> mean? I would appreciate it if the Minister elaborated on that in his remarks, and I hope that he reassures me. In theory, that could be a cop-out clause for PCTs. If they could argue that they do not provide a service, or do not provide it to the level that the local population might believe, they would be able to hide behind that expression. That weakens what the Government are proposing to do. However, I suspect that the Minister does not intend that to happen. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.4.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1259" speakername="Gary Streeter" time="9:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s02.htm" colnum="848">
<p> Does my hon. Friend agree that another interpretation of the words</p>
<p><span class="indent">''to the extent that it considers it reasonable to do so''</span></p>
<p> is ''to the extent that it can afford to do so'', which lets off the hook not only PCTs but the Government? One can imagine that, for a PCT, a shortage of funding would be a good excuse for not making such a service available. </p>

<p> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who anticipates a point that I will discuss in due course. I have been made aware by the Minister's sedentary comments that the debate has the potential to degenerate rather than remain at an intelligent level. I am not confident that that level will continue once the Minister begins to speak. I will say&mdash;to pray in aid my case&mdash;that the Minister should be a little cautious before he begins his misrepresentation and his rant about funding, because the Government have been in power for six years. One cannot constantly live solely in the past: defining what has happened between 1997&mdash;</p>

<p> Labour Members may find it strange that a certain party seems to want more money to be spent on primary dental services. Removing the qualifying phrase in subsection (1)&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="indent">''to the extent that it considers it reasonable to do so''&mdash;</span></p>
<p> would render it meaningless because it would simply state: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Each Primary Care Trust and Local Health Board must provide primary dental services within its area, or secure their provision within its area.''</span></p>

<p> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I do not accept his argument. The phrase could throw an element of doubt into the procedures or introduce a barrier or excuse that PCTs would be able to hide behind. I will not argue with the hon. Gentleman, because if he believes that the amendment would render the subsection meaningless, which I do not, then presumably, rather than include a phrase that causes doubt, we should strengthen the subsection to remove any element of doubt.</p>

<p> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could point out to the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) that amendments Nos. 635 and 636, which would insert the words,</p>
<p><span class="indent">''in accordance with identified local need'',</span></p>
<p> are supposed to be taken together to reassure him that although part of the clause may be taken out, needs will be identified and met. If, as he believes, the removal of the qualifying phrase would make the subsection unreasonable, that would make it meaningful again. </p>

<p> One minute.</p>
<p> Of course, that provision is crucial, because one of the main functions of PCTs is to identify local health needs or, in the case of this part of the Bill, dental health needs and to seek to commission treatment and care for patients. </p>

<p> In accepting the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, is the Conservative party supporting the notion that, in certain areas, the public sector should pay in full for dental services according to need? That would be the effect of amendment No. 636, and it would go completely against what the hon. Gentleman's party did when in office. The amendment would require the PCT to pay for all dental services according to local need.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and, as I said at the beginning of my comments, if one is to have a health care system that includes dental care, one must respond to local needs. In many ways, this is about changing the way in which dental care is commissioned in an area and by whom.</p>
<p> The Government are using this part of the Bill in an imaginative way to devolve power to local PCTs, which is absolutely right. Sadly, we have not heard from the Minister yet, so we will have to wait to hear how he envisages the measures will work. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon stated, we do not know what will drive these reforms. Of course, spending drives the health systems in this country, and we will be very interested to hear how the Government will implement their proposals for funding that expenditure. Do they, for example, expect this innovation to be funded by their existing levels of expenditure, or do they think that the responsibilities and systems that they are imposing on PCTs will, in fact, generate more funding requirements from the existing NHS budget, and will they adjust their funding mechanisms accordingly? </p>
<p> We also do not know when the proposals will be implemented. We are at a loss because we are not familiar with all the Government's intentions for the exact working of the system and when it will be introduced. Will that be in the next 12 months or in two, three or four years? </p>

<p> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that Labour Members find it ironic that the Conservative party is making a major argument for huge expansion in NHS dentistry. Putting that aside, has the hon. Gentleman worked out how much the amendments would cost the NHS?</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is not taking in what I am saying. I welcome the fact that commissioning for dental care will be devolved to PCTs.</p>
<p> I welcome the fact that it will provide services at a local level. That is not in the Bill, but the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is seeking through his amendment to include that commitment in the Bill. </p>
<p> However, until we hear from the Minister, we are in the dark about exactly how he expects the system to work on the ground, and whether he expects the system to work under the existing framework and arrangement. Alternatively, does the Minister envisage an expansion in the provision of dental care as a result of the changes in systems? As we all know, dental care is very different from most of the rest of NHS provision. It is split significantly between those who use the private sector for a variety of reasons, and those who have to, or choose to, use solely the NHS. Of course, even those who use the NHS do not, in most cases, receive a service that is free at the point of use. To return to my original point, that is because dental services have, almost since the beginning of the NHS&mdash;although not from day one&mdash;included an element of charging for a proportion of the cost of treatment. </p>

<p> Before the hon. Gentleman goes down that path, I would like to recognise that the hon. Member for Leigh made some important points, which I would have appreciated responding to in my own speech.</p>
<p> It is important to note that amendment No. 636 does not use the words ''all identified need''. It is not an unlimited spending commitment, but it is a </p>
<p> commitment to spending more. Liberal Democrats support the fact that extra resources are being made available. We also want the PCTs to be elected and to have tax-varying powers to meet the needs that they want to prioritise. The hon. Member for Leigh's point is a fair one to put to the Conservative party&mdash;it is quite political&mdash;but I hope that he recognises that the way that the amendment is worded does not provide for an unlimited spending commitment, and that Liberal Democrats at least have a democratic mechanism to respond to that. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The amendment is not talking about ''all'', but ''the'' local need. It is in that context that I am making my comments, because I have been very careful in the course of my remarks not to give any commitment in any shape or form on spending. It is not appropriate in the context of the discussion of these amendments for us to do so.</p>
<p> I think&mdash;I say this with a degree of kindness&mdash;that the hon. Gentleman's intervention was too hard. I welcomed the first part of his intervention. However, vis-à-vis the second part of his intervention, I knew that it was only a matter of time before he jumped on the bandwagon and tried to turn this debate into a party-political dogfight, rather than maintaining the higher standards of intelligent debate on the provision of dental services. </p>

<p> I will not, because I wish to make progress and to conclude my remarks so that possibly the hon. Gentleman himself could make an invaluable contribution to our discussions; clearly he has an interest in and knowledge of dental services from his work on the Select Committee on Health.</p>
<p> I conclude with two points. First, with this part of the Bill the Government seek to achieve a significant change from the status quo and, in many ways, an overhaul and update of a system that was put in place when the provision of health care was in a different situation. In doing so, in many instances the Government raise more questions than answers. It is important that we hear what the Minister has to say, because I suspect that he will have an opportunity with these amendments not only to put flesh on the bones of this part of the Bill, but to inform us more about the way in which the Government intend this part of the legislation to work. </p>
<p> In dealing with the amendments and his proposals, the Minister must share with us when he anticipates the proposals being introduced. Moreover, how does he anticipate that the reforms will impact on the provision of dental care and its cost? </p>

<p> Most of my constituents' principal concern is the patchy provision of dental services. Amendment No. 635 would help to remove the possibility of that patchiness continuing. It is certainly the case that one can get different services in different areas. For the new section 16CA(1) to contain the phrase</p>
<p><span class="indent">''to the extent that it considers it reasonable to do so''</span></p>
<p> means that the service will continue to be provided as it is at present, so it would help if that phrase were deleted. In subsections (5) and (6) we see that regulations may define primary dental services and those that would be provided by contractors. At a lower level, the primary care trusts pass judgment, or comment, on that level of regulated provision and tweak it to suit local need. That is very good in theory but in practice would mean that there would continue to be a patchwork of services across the country that would vary from one primary care trust to another, and that would be wholly undesirable. Therefore the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon was right to table amendment No. 635, which would delete the phrase </p>
<p><span class="indent">''to the extent that it considers it reasonable to do so''. </span></p>
<p>Primary care trusts would be allowed to concentrate on those primary dental services that have been mandated by regulation. That would lead to more uniform primary dental services across the country, which most of my constituents want. </p>

<p> First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon on tabling the amendment. It has given us the opportunity to discuss what is, by common consent, a very important and significant part of the Bill. Those were the words of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), and I agree with them.</p>
<p> It may have escaped the attention of anyone who was listening to the debate because of the words that were uttered, but part 4 of the Bill has been broadly welcomed. It is not the biggest shake-up of NHS dentistry in 30 years; it is the biggest shake-up since the NHS was established in 1945. It is a very important and significant area for the NHS. All of us know that our constituents experience problems in accessing NHS dental services, so it might be helpful for the Committee if I make it clear at the beginning that the clause is not about maintaining the status quo, but changing it. It is not about providing a covert mechanism for rationing, which is the usual approach of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon to every such issue. It is about widening access to NHS dental services and providing a more up-to-date legal framework that will better allow primary care trusts to develop and plan those services strategically. </p>
<p> Part 4 makes several significant changes, and clause 157 is at the heart of those changes. The clause will place on primary care trusts and local health boards in Wales a new duty to commission dental services or provide them directly. There is no such explicit duty under the existing legislation, so existing legislation does not provide a robust-enough platform for developing NHS dental services. It is worth reminding ourselves, because no one has mentioned it yet, that section 35 of the 1977 Act merely requires primary care trusts to enable general dental services to be delivered when a dentist has agreed to provide such services. That is not a satisfactory basis on which to </p>
<p> develop the role of NHS dentistry to meet the needs of local communities. </p>
<p> No one is satisfied with the existing arrangements&mdash;we certainly are not. Thus, the new duty has been widely welcomed. Clause 157 will broadly shift the responsibility for commissioning NHS dentistry on to a basis similar to that of other medical services that primary care trusts are obligated to provide. This is an important new addition to the framework of NHS legislation. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for West Chelmsford said that he wanted to flush out my intentions. I am happy, if by doing so he can perhaps set aside some of the concerns that have been raised. </p>
<p> This group of amendments essentially addresses the concerns of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon about the word ''reasonable'' in clause 157, which inserts new section 16CA in the 1977 legislation. It may be helpful to give a little background on this. The use of the word ''reasonable'' in new section 16CA(1) mirrors its usage in section 3 of the 1977 Act, which states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''It is the Secretary of State's duty to provide throughout England and Wales, to such extent as he considers necessary to meet all reasonable requirements'',</span></p>
<p> a national health service. The duty in new section 16CA relates to the primary care trust area, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh made clear, without the test of reasonableness it would be difficult to interpret that provision succinctly. This is a new departure, so we must be as precise as possible. Given that, it would be unhelpful to inject an element of uncertainty into the precise parameters of the new duty. </p>
<p> With the greatest respect to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, his assessment of his own amendment is not accurate. It certainly was not helped by the clarification given by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford, who spoke in its favour. </p>
<p> Let me explain the fundamental difficulty with the amendment. Primary dental services are a description of what dentists do, rather than a service provided by the NHS itself. Therefore, his amendment would affect not only NHS dentistry, but private dentistry. It could be interpreted as meaning that the Liberal Democrats want primary care trusts to be put under a duty to promote the development of private dentistry. That may well be what the hon. Gentleman intends, but I suspect that he intended to provide a duty to develop NHS dentistry. However, that is not what his amendment proposes. This may well be a probing amendment, but I do not get the sense that it is. </p>

<p> I anticipated that the Government would take that approach. It is unfair to do so, because neither we, nor the Minister, oppose the ability of primary care trusts, and commissioning bodies in general, to commission services for the NHS from private dentistry. The Minister is saying that a need for private dentistry may be identified, and that it will somehow be the commissioners' role to ensure that people who feel a desperate need to pay privately</p>
<p> shall have that need met. That is not a fair interpretation of health need generally. I have never heard the Government mention, when they discuss health need in their many documents and consultation papers, the desperate need, and the right, of people to find services for which they can pay directly or through insurance. Therefore, the Minister's attack is a little unfair.</p>

<p> I am not trying to be unfair to the hon. Gentleman; I am simply telling him what his amendment proposes. There is a distinction between the two. As the hon. Gentleman well knows, we have no objection to encouraging a plurality of different health care providers&mdash;a concept to which the hon. Gentlemen is something of a late convert. It is a sensible way to maximise capacity and make it available to NHS patients, and it would be provided free at the point of use. That is not the issue. His amendment places a duty on primary care trusts to promote the development of private dental services.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but that simply confirms that he does not understand the purpose of the clause. If he were talking about general dental services, that would be a different story. However, he is talking about primary dental services, and that clearly includes private provision. I do not argue whether that is an appropriate way to provide treatment of NHS patients; it clearly is, and that is how it is currently provided. The question is whether that makes sense in terms of his proposals. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would clarify whether or not this is a probing amendment.</p>
<p> He did not make that point in his introduction. We have to take the amendments at face value as a serious attempt to widen the commissioning responsibilities and duties of PCTs. </p>

<p> Would the Minister's claim that this seeks to promote private dentistry apply if amendment No. 635, which would delete the words</p>

<p> were rejected, and the words </p>
<p><span class="indent">''in accordance with identified local need''</span></p>
<p> were accepted? Would commissioners or providers be saved from having to secure and help the development of private dentistry by a test of ''reasonableness'', or by amendment No. 636, which talks about ''identified local need''?

<p> I thank my right hon. Friend for showing the good manners that are so uncharacteristically lacking in his opposite number. The real weakness in amendment No. 636, which the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon seems to be advancing, is that it does not limit the number of people who could identify local need. The amendment does not restrict that role to the PCT, because it is so vague, it could mean that anyone in an area could identify local need, which the PCT would then be expected to meet.</p>

<p> I did address that point when I started to speak to the amendments, which feels like a lifetime ago. Amendment No. 636 would not aid the proper interpretation of clause 157 because it is so completely open-ended and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh made clear, it would be difficult to determine the duty of PCTs.</p>
<p> I tried to say&mdash;for the sake of recalling the argument&mdash;that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon was concerned about where the concept of reasonableness came from. I made it clear to him that it is broadly the Secretary of State's existing duty under section 3 of the 1977 Act. We are not importing an innovation or taking a back-door route to rationing. This is the current broad framework within which NHS services are commissioned and provided by the Secretary of State. </p>

<p> The Minister read from section 3 of the 1977 Act. However, I would be grateful if he read it again so that, in my response, I can get the wording exactly right. The wording in the Act is not the same as that in the Bill, because section 3(1) talks about the ''necessary''&mdash;a word that is not in clause 157&mdash;steps to secure reasonable requirements, and it lists those requirements. There is a difference between taking necessary steps to secure reasonable needs and doing something reasonably without any reference to its being necessary or to what those needs are.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman is scraping the bottom of the barrel with that approach. There is no substantive difference. Typically, he is making a mountain out of a molehill. I have no doubt whatsoever that this is a broadly comparable provision. The hon. Gentleman should not be developing his arguments along those lines.</p>
<p> Amendment No. 636&mdash;regardless of who the author is, and we can have a debate about that&mdash;would not help. It would introduce unfortunate ambiguity into the parameters of the new commissioning duty, and we can do without that. The real difficulty with the amendment, which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, is that it suggests that PCTs should provide services in accordance with identified local need. We expect a PCT to have regard to the needs of persons resident in its area, but as the hon. Gentleman knows, dental services have always been provided on the basis of catchment area rather than residential area. That </p>
<p> means that the public can access the service where it is most convenient, and we want that to continue. </p>
<p> It is at least arguable&mdash;probably more so than in the case of the words chosen by the hon. Gentleman&mdash;that amendment No. 636 would limit the service to what was required to meet the PCT's local health needs. I assume that the amendment is intended to cover the local resident population, rather than to those who want to use it wherever they are resident.

<p> Will the Minister explain the difference between catchment and resident population bases? It was not clear from his remarks. If he could do that, it might help me to respond to his interesting argument.</p>

<p> The catchment could be outside the PCT area, as is currently the case with NHS dental services. That is the difficulty with the amendment. Many commuters will register with an NHS dentist in Westminster because that is where they work and where they use services.</p>
<p> There is genuine difficulty with the amendment. I am not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill, but the new commissioning duty should be made as clear and simple as possible. I understand the hon. Gentleman's intentions; he wants PCTs to plan the provision of dental services, using their new statutory duties to commission in a way that meets the needs of local people. As I understand it, that is what the new commissioning responsibilities require them to do, so there is no issue. I say only that his amendment is unnecessary and its precise meaning is unclear. We do not know how it would affect historic patterns of registration with dental practitioners. I cannot support this group of amendments. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for West Chelmsford raised the subject of resources. With hindsight, he might acknowledge that that was not very clever, given that Labour Members know what happened to NHS dentistry when his lot were last in office. This refrain may sound familiar, but I am sure that he will understand why I use it: I do not think that anyone in the country believes that if the Tories were ever returned to power, they would suddenly reverse the changes that they made to NHS dentistry, or find that their policy was to spend significantly more on it. The hon. Gentleman will make no progress if that is the thrust of his argument. </p>
<p> The issue of resources is, however, important. It may help if I speak about that now, rather than being tempted to do so on every group of amendments. That would be tedious, although Labour Members would enjoy it. The changes to NHS dentistry in part 4 create a new legal platform within which those services can be provided. That is long overdue and widely welcomed. However, as I said earlier, we know that in some parts of the country it is difficult, especially for adults, to access NHS dental care. In some cases, </p>
<p> patients feel that they have to pay privately to see a dentist. That situation is not good, but we inherited it from the Conservative party. </p>
<p> Measures such as the establishment of personal dental services pilots, including dental access centres, have been taken to improve access to NHS dentistry, and they have done an excellent job in extending the range and reach of NHS dental services. However, more must be done. The proposals in the Bill underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service, provided through contracts between PCTs and dental practices. PCTs will have a duty to secure the provision of primary dental services, either through contracts with individual practices or by providing services directly. With those new responsibilities will come £1.2 billion of financial resources that are currently held centrally. </p>
<p> I make the important point that once the reformed system is in place, it will be possible, over time, to adjust NHS allocations to take account of the health inequalities that can only persist under the old system. I acknowledge that the existing funding arrangements are unsatisfactory. They reflect the varying willingness of dentists to treat, rather than the needs of the NHS to secure dentistry. </p>
<p> I can give the Committee the important guarantee that current spending will be protected. We will also take some short-term measures until the implementation of the Bill enables the NHS to address local historical anomalies, with additional funds being deployed to support PCTs as they get to grips with the new agenda. </p>
<p> In the longer term, allocations will need to take health needs into account, as general allocations currently do. In some areas that may mean that additional funding for dentistry will be available to PCTs so that they can begin to address the long-term oral health inequalities that many of them face. Clearly that would be taken into account in future allocations within the framework of the funding formula. </p>

<p> Yes. We hope to have the new GDS contract operational by 2005, and we intend to commence the implementation and operation of the provisions as soon as possible. Perhaps we can return to the matter at hand.</p>
<p> Alongside the practice-based contracts, I want to move to a more preventive approach to the provision of dental services in much the same way as the Health Committee's report on access to NHS dentistry recommended. The Bill will end reliance on the fee-per-item-of-service method of paying dentists. Also, clause 158 will, for the first time since the foundation of the NHS, give dental GPs the opportunity to focus on prevention and health promotion as well as treatment. Those are important provisions. </p>
<p> The amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon are unfounded, they </p>
<p> are not well drafted and they would not add clarity to the duties that we are placing on PCTs. The amendment in the name of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford would take us into similarly uncharted waters and create ambiguity that the NHS can do without. </p>

<p> The Minister asked whether these were probing amendments. I may not have the necessary experience, but I did not think that it was a requirement to say at the outset whether an amendment was ''merely'' probing. I would hope that all amendments were probing. I sometimes wait to hear a Minister's response before I decide whether to press an amendment to a vote.</p>
<p> I do not accept the Minister's counter-arguments, perhaps because I have not understood them. That may be due to my deficiency in understanding or his deficiency in explaining. We will leave others to judge when reading Hansard. </p>
<p> The Minister said correctly that this is partly about rationing. The hon. Member for Leigh made that point too. My position is clear&mdash;there will always be rationing in a publicly funded cash-limited health service. The question is not whether there will be rationing. There are two key questions. First, how much rationing will there be? In other words, what services that are not available on the health service, or not available without a charge, do the health professional and the patient together think would be of net benefit to the patient? </p>
<p> Secondly, how explicit will that rationing be? There is, and has been, far too much rationing, and I have supported greater funds for the health service to reduce it. The Government's latest comprehensive spending review details the funding that they plan to put into the NHS. We argue that it is five or six years too late, but we accept that the level of extra funding is about right. I am at one with the Minister on the degree of rationing. </p>
<p> It is the failure to be explicit about rationing that concerns me. People should know what they will not be able to have, and they should not have the wool pulled over their eyes with the pretence that a treatment would not be beneficial, when it would be beneficial but simply cannot be afforded. </p>
<p> Citizens, voters and taxpayers should be empowered, so that when they know that something is not available because of a lack of resources, they can vote for politicians who are committed to the expansion of the necessary resources. Otherwise, not realising how much is unavailable to them, they may be duped into voting for tax-cutting, expenditure-cutting parties. The Government should find common cause with us on that, for their electoral well-being as well as ours. We take a generally similar view on the quantum of funding, whereas the Conservative party does not. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, the framing of the clause leads to fog rather than to clarity on rationing. </p>

<p> May I have clarification about tax-cutting parties? I am under the impression that the hon. Gentleman has just</p>

<p> Let me be a little clearer: this is about the quantum of resources and about how those resources are raised. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point: in any tax-and-spend package, some taxes will be raised and others will be reduced. Our policy is to cut unfair taxes and to raise fairer taxes, so he is quite right. We are keen to cut unfair taxes. Let us not talk about tax cutting or tax raising, because one can get into silly arguments. The question is whether&mdash;</p>

<p> Quite so. The question is whether parties are committed to the quantum of resources, and the increase in resources, going into the health service. We voted for the rise in national insurance that the Government are using to fund the increase, but the Conservatives voted against it. That implies that the Conservative party is not in support of the additional resources. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that that argument can be made and that there is, therefore, a question of rationing. How does one provide a greater level of services when one does not put in the resources?</p>
<p> As I said, the key issue with the amendment is whether rationing is explicit. If citizens, patients, consumers, voters and taxpayers are to understand what services are not available, it would help them if there was clear information on the level of need and on what services are provided. The next group of amendments provides the other part of that equation. This amendment seeks to ensure that primary care trusts look at identified need and then make decisions on what can be met, taking reasonableness into account. That is why amendment No. 636 stands on its own, in addition to whatever words the Government want to put in to ensure that there is a test of reasonableness&mdash;the rationing test&mdash;before meeting those resources. Amendment No. 636 ensures that any rationing becomes explicit. </p>
<p> The Minister was right to say that this is about rationing, and the hon. Member for Leigh was right to question the Conservatives about how they can support the amendments without at least supporting a significant increase in funding to give some scope for meeting&mdash;[Interruption]. Is the hon. Gentleman seeking to intervene? </p>

<p> It is slightly easier to put that question as an intervention, because, given the acoustics, it is hard to hear what is being said from a sedentary position. The question needs to be answered, but perhaps not in this forum. The rationing issue is clear, and I want to state clearly that the amendment is predicated on the basis of achieving greater explicitness. The Minister said&mdash;he sometimes says this and sometimes does not&mdash;that I am a late convert in relation to the plurality of providers. I have challenged him and his colleague to find any</p>
<p> statement in which I am on the record as saying that that I am opposed in principle to the provision of NHS services by non-NHS providers. I have opposed an increase, at the expense of NHS provision, in privately commissioned services, private pay-as-you-go services or insurance-based services, especially those that are subsidised by NHS money, such as the system recently proposed by the Conservatives.</p>
<p> Moreover, I am opposed to private health care being delivered through NHS services when it is against the interests of NHS users, because to jump the queue is unfair. Should the Minister continue to make this allegation, I should be grateful if he could find anything I have said to suggest that I do not support the mixed-provider message. </p>
<p> My main difficulty with the Minister's rejection of amendment No. 635 is that he thinks that the meaning of the words in subsection (1) </p>
<p><span class="indent">''to the extent that it considers it reasonable to do so,''</span></p>
<p> in relation to the provision, or the securing of the provision, of primary dental services, is equivalent to the general duty on the Secretary of State as set out in section 51 of the National Health Service Act 1977. I think it is the same as in section 3 of the Act. I invited the Minister to repeat the reference, but he was unable to do so. There is a difference, because the wording in that section concerns doing what is necessary, and makes the qualification of ''reasonable'' only after saying that he must do what is necessary to secure what is a reasonable need. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.4.55" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" speakername="John Hutton" time="10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s05.htm" colnum="860">
<p> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood what section 16(6)(a)(i) provides. If he looks at it carefully he will understand that the primary care trust must provide those services that it considers reasonable so to do. The use of ''necessary'' that he is harking on about does not change that one iota.</p>

<p> It may be that we must look at what the Minister has said and, at a later stage or in another place, table an amendment that has the exact wording that applies to the provision of general medical services. The Minister implied that the effect was the same and that to use the words that apply to the rest of the health service would make this clause unnecessarily complex. That is a debate that must take place when the wording is before the Committee. I accept that it is incumbent on Opposition parties to put those words in an amendment so that the Minister can argue with them.</p>
<p> Furthermore, the Minister argued that, because the wording was broadly comparable, we should not go down that path. However, when I have not been convinced by what he says, I am always sceptical when he urges me not to go down the path, because that suggests that he is not clear of his own ground. </p>

<p> It is questionable whether an amendment would be in order. I should be grateful if the Minister could advise me on how I might do that, other than through a new clause. I accept that in order to deal fully with his response to this amendment and to test it we would have to bring back an amendment with the same wording as section 51&mdash;if that is the section to which he refers.</p>
<p> I did not understand the Minister's argument about catchment and resident populations, and I am not sure that he was convinced that that was a relevant argument. I am not sure from his two comments on it&mdash;one in response to my intervention&mdash;which arrangement exists now. Could the Minister clarify whether dental services are currently arranged on a resident or a catchment population basis? I should be grateful for his advice. I should also like clarity on the position of someone who comes to work at Westminster, lives in Westminster and wants to access an NHS dentist in Westminster. Will that person receive dental services on the basis of residency or catchment? </p>

<p> I made it clear that it is currently done on a catchment basis through reinvestments to general dental practitioners through the Dental Practice Board. The effect of this amendment&mdash;in crude terms&mdash;would be to prevent primary care trusts providing services on that basis. Instead they could provide them only to people who lived in their areas. That would be a retrograde step.</p>

<p> I now understand what the Minister is saying: catchment applies, by definition, to those who register with a dentist, rather than to a local resident population. School catchments imply a residency qualification, and that is why I was confused.</p>
<p> However, amendment No. 636 does not talk about local residents' needs, but local needs. As the Minister will know from other areas of the health service, many areas have a duty to provide health services for tourists. Indeed, such areas get extra funding under the weighted capitation allocations to meet the needs of tourists and commuters. He will also know that that is the case for Westminster, among other places. That is an example of local needs, but clearly not local residents' needs. Because the word ''resident'' is not in amendment No. 636, I understand his point, but I still do not think that it applies. It might have been easier to have the debate on wording that the Government have accepted in other areas of the health service. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 635. </p>

<p> Amendment No. 637 also relates to clause 157. New section 16CA(3) reads:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''Each Primary Care Trust and Local Health Board must publish information about such matters as may be prescribed in relation to the primary dental services for which it makes provision under this section.''</span></p>
<p> I will deal with amendment No. 638 presently, which is an amendment to clause 159. </p>
<p> Access to information about local dental services is clearly fundamental to enable consumers or patients to find appropriate dental care locally. As MPs, we know that access to information about local services is a high priority for people who come to see us who simply do not know where to find an NHS dentist. The Consumers Association found that to be the top priority for its members and consumers in a consumer health survey conducted in May 2001. An Office of Fair Trading consumers' survey found that 60 per cent. of those surveyed did not know where to find information about local dental services, which confirms the existing research on this issue. </p>
<p> In June 2001, the Consumers Association examined how NHS Direct provided information about NHS dental services and found that it was extremely patchy and generally poor. The Consumers Association told me that it has noted that there is no obligation on NHS Direct to provide information about private dental services. The Government may feel that it is not the job of the Government or the commissioning body to ensure that information is available about private dental services, and the Minister may want to comment on that. </p>
<p> There is clearly a problem with information, but without information about what is provided, we do not have the other half of what is required for an explicit system of rationing to ensure that people&mdash;patients, voters and taxpayers&mdash;know what they are voting for when they get it. Amendment No. 638 is important because there is a problem with the failure to provide consumers and patients with the necessary information. </p>
<p> The Office of Fair Trading report is relevant. It recommended that dentists should provide their patients and the population that they serve with clear information on indicative prices for common treatments, detailed treatment plans together with information on any other options and estimates of the likely costs, access to dental records and complaints procedure. Such information is fundamental to the delivery of a patient-centred service and to any notion of patient choice. </p>
<p> One would expect this to be sensible and to be observed by all dental practitioners, but the Office of Fair Trading report found that that was not the case, and that is extremely disappointing. There is a strong argument that dentists should inform consumers about the likely cost of NHS care and how to find an alternative dentist offering NHS treatment if they cease to offer it. Consumers tend not to look for a </p>
<p> different dentist, even if their usual dentist stops providing NHS care. I have had constituents whose dentists have stopped providing NHS care. They have been told that they can join Denplan or Dencare, but they have not been given the name of an alternative NHS dentist. That is not too much to ask. </p>
<p> These are genuine concerns, not only for us but also for the Consumers Association and the Office of Fair Trading. It is particularly important in an area such as dentistry where, historically, care has been provided by people who also have a private practice and, therefore, have a tremendous incentive to increase the market for that private care, particularly given that the rewards are so significantly better than their NHS remuneration and are always likely to be so. It is also important that this information is available where, in this particular area of health care, there is so much co-payment and co-charging. That is why dentistry is unique and why it creates a greater need for information so that consumers and patients may be absolutely clear, and to be made available not only by those who commission it, but also, in these cases, by those who provide it.

<p> I obviously have a great deal more sympathy for the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon on these amendments than I did with the other group of amendments that he moved. All of us, when talking to our constituents, have come across a generally recurring theme: the information about what NHS dentistry services are available and how the public might access them is often pretty poor and frequently difficult to understand. That is why the Government, in bringing forward new section 16CA(3), are very much in favour of greater consumer information and choice being made available. These are new duties on primary care trusts and local health boards to make this sort of information available to the public. I am sure that it was an omission on the hon. Gentleman's part not to say that he greatly welcomed the introduction of this new statutory provision.</p>
<p> The question is not whether we provide this information, because we should; the question is how we do it, and how we do it in the most effective way. We are thinking about dealing with this, as the clause makes clear, on the basis of regulations rather than through the Bill itself. We can argue that fairly and reasonably on several grounds. The requirements will inevitably change over time as providers' abilities to provide information improves. For example, in the future, it may be a requirement to make available certain statistical information that providers do not currently record. We should therefore look at alternative ways of ensuring that that information flow remains up to date. The danger of putting anything into primary legislation in the way in which the hon. Gentleman proposes is that it tends to get stuck in time. </p>
<p> I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need for the sort of information that amendment No. 638 lists to be made available to members of the public. It may be helpful to him and the Committee if I make it clear </p>
<p> that our experience from over five years of piloting primary dental services is that this sort of information is best provided through national requirements, which local contracts must then contain. </p>
<p> Proposed new section 28O, which we shall come to later, will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying mandatory contractual terms. The information required in the amendment will be covered by that type of provision. </p>
<p> We are also committed to learning from the field sites, several of which are concerned with improving the patient experience. The Modernisation Agency is setting up some 20 sites to test ideas that we want to incorporate into the dental service contract as it develops. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 638 seeks to replace new section 28L(2), which allows regulations to describe services </p>
<p><span class="indent">''by reference to the manner or circumstances in which they are provided.''</span></p>
<p> For example, the regulations could state that certain services could be provided on week days, perhaps between the crucial working hours of 9 am to 6 pm. Amendment No. 638 deals with completely different territory. However, I am sure that it is not intended to remove the flexibility that proposed new section 28L(2) will give with the exercise of powers conferred by proposed new section 28L(1). It is not a restricted provision; it attempts to ensure that there is a power to make regulations in cases where it would be helpful to patients and consumers. </p>
<p> I agree strongly with the hon. Gentleman's sentiments, and I know where he is coming from. This information should be made available. Regulations will ensure that that information is relevant and up to date. We can also consider mandatory contractual terms as a further platform for progressing such information exchange. I have only one argument with the hon. Gentleman, which is where we do it, not how we do it. For the reasons that I have given, it is better done through regulations and new contracts. </p>

<p> Clause 157 largely enacts the provisions outlined in ''Options for Change'', and I want to examine some of the implications of the new commissioning regime. I was able to discuss the matter with the now Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy), when he appeared before the Select Committee on Health a few weeks ago as Under-Secretary of State for Health, a role which, sadly, from the Department of Health's point of view, he no longer holds. He was able to throw some light on how the system will operate, but I</p>
<p> should like the Minister to confirm a few points or let us have the Department's views on how it will operate.</p>
<p> The extensive discussion on PCTs and local health boards did not touch on how decisions will be made on what is reasonable with regard to the provision of private dental services. How much public consultation will there be? Will there be consultation with the broader public or will it be restricted to professional providers? Will an outline plan be published, on which consultation could be sought? Or will decisions on provision simply be taken and commissioned arrangements secured to support them? </p>
<p> I believe that the field test site programme is almost completely in place and that an implementation date for the new commissioning arrangements of April 2005 is still the aim. Will the Minister confirm that there are arrangements to allow that timetable to be met and that there is sufficient expertise available to people who are new to commissioning, not least the dentists themselves or those involved in the commissioning negotiation procedure? Would it not be better to have a simple default contract that could be negotiated rather than various PCTs having different contracts? I should be grateful to the Minister for an explanation of those issues. </p>

<p> I return to the issue that I flagged up earlier, which I hope the Minister will be able to address. How will the provision or commissioning of dental services by primary care trusts improve the services for certain vulnerable groups of people who are currently significantly underprovided for?</p>
<p> I do not have detailed briefing notes about the situation in the Prison Service, and I know that the Prison Service had a separate health care system from the NHS until recently when it was finally announced, after a long time, that there would be an effective merger. However, it has been generally acknowledged in various reports by the chief inspector of prisons that the provision of dental health care&mdash;and even access to emergency treatment, let alone preventive work&mdash;is appalling in prisons. There may be historical reasons for that: perhaps it was not felt unreasonable in the past that people in prison should suffer toothache. However, it is a miserable thing to have to suffer, and poor dental health has significant implications for infection, particularly systemic infections and infections of heart valves, and for the general health of the patient or person concerned. </p>
<p> There is now plenty of research that shows that the poor provision of dental health care in prisons creates major problems for people who have been in prison, and a significant financial burden on the NHS, which has to pick up the pieces. I should be grateful if the Minister would take the opportunity to assure me that there will be some thinking about that matter when primary care trusts take over responsibility for the provision and commissioning of NHS dentistry, and that either specific duties will be imposed on them with regard to prisons&mdash;there is very little lobbying of them by people in prisons&mdash;or there will be some other mechanism. </p>
<p> The second area that I am concerned about is people who are not in prison and are not criminals but who are otherwise in detention. In my constituency the Campsfield house immigration centre has a number of people detained, sometimes for very long periods even though that was not the intention. Some of them, not unsurprisingly, have dental health care needs, and I understand that the detention centre has only been able to avail itself of the services of one community dental practitioner once a fortnight because of the extent of rationing. I do not see how it is compatible with human rights for people to be left in that situation. I know this because people who have been in detention there have contacted me while in detention or after their release. How can it be compatible with basic decency for people to be left for weeks, shut off from the outside world, not having been convicted of an offence and unable to obtain access to the dental health care that they need? People in the outside world with relatively trivial complaints can simply go to the dental practitioner with whom they are registered or get access to some of the community dental services and personal dental services schemes that the Government have introduced. </p>
<p> This is something that I feel strongly about. I will not go into any more detail, but I seek an assurance from the Minister that he is aware of the problem and that it will be dealt with, not only through the Bill, but in general even before this measure reaches the statute book. </p>

<p> As we have realised during discussions on this clause, we are talking about a significant revamping and overhauling of the provision of primary dental services. But there is one area that we have not really touched on, about which the BDA is particularly concerned, I think with some justification.</p>
<p> I should like to raise the issue of dental service staffing so that the Minister is aware of our thinking. As we shall discover as we progress through the amendments to this part, the Government envisage not simply overhauling the commissioning process but specifying an expansion in the duties and services provided. Such expansion, however, requires a sufficient number of properly trained dentists and dental nurses, hygienists and therapists. Will the Minister explain how he will plan for future staffing in the dental service to fulfil the Government's aims as set out in the clause? </p>

<p> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I have come fully briefed for this debate; he need not worry about that.</p>
<p> My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham (Jim Dowd) asked three important questions, and I shall try </p>
<p> to deal with each in turn. First, he asked about preparations for the new general dental service contract. As he knows, some 20 sites with approximately 100 dental practices will be involved in testing the contract. They are preparing to start on 1 October. I am assured that all arrangements are proceeding satisfactorily, and our intention is to begin to test those new arrangements on that date. The Government have made it clear that they want those provisions and the new contract to start in April 2005, and that remains our strong intention. It is the Department's job to ensure that that timetable is observed. </p>
<p> Secondly, my hon. Friend asked about the default contract. Clause 160 provides for that, and it is not optional; provision must be made for a default contract in the interim period. We shall activate that provision, so dentists need not worry in that regard. Thirdly, my hon. Friend raised the important issue of the PCTs' new commissioning responsibilities. He asked whether I thought it appropriate for PCTs or local health boards simply to make decisions and then publish their strategies. That would not be appropriate; it is the responsibility of PCTs to consult widely on their new commissioning responsibilities and to develop their local dental strategies in an open and transparent way. </p>
<p> For many years, the NHS has been a secret society wherein plans are made and announced, and people have to take them or leave them. That is absolutely not how the new NHS will operate. This is an opportunity for local PCTs to consult widely on the development of their services, particularly dental services. Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 requires proper public consultation on any significant change to service delivery, and that will apply as much to dental services as to other parts of the NHS. Those are all significant gains for transparency and openness, and I hope that my hon. Friend is reassured. </p>
<p> I apologise to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon for not referring to prisons earlier. The new commissioning responsibilities for PCTs will apply to prisons in their area, so they will have a responsibility to make reasonable provision in that regard. I am not aware of the particular problems at Campsfield detention centre, but I shall make inquiries and write to the hon. Gentleman if he has concerns. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.4.73" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" speakername="Evan Harris" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s07.htm" colnum="867">
<p> I do not want to retread the ground of amendment No. 635, but does the Minister think that the current provision for prisons is reasonable? If it is not, could PCTs be criticised for continuing with the current provision rather than increasing it? I am talking in general terms. The problem lies with the use of the word ''reasonable''. PCTs may consider it reasonable not to offer much of a service to people who have fallen foul of the law. That is why prison health care is so appalling, as is commonly recognised. I hope that the Minister will state his view of the current state of dental health care in prisons.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.4.74" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" speakername="John Hutton" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s08.htm" colnum="867">
<p> It is for PCTs to make those determinations in their own area. I could not say whether dental provision in every prison and detention</p>
<p> centre is sufficient, and I would not want to volunteer an opinion about that. It is not in my capacity to do so. However, it is important that PCTs look carefully at their new responsibilities and plan accordingly. I do not doubt that there could be an improvement in dental provision in many parts of the Prison Service, and I look forward to that happening.</p>
<p> The hon. Member for West Chelmsford also raised some important issues. If we want to expand and improve NHS dentistry, we must ensure that there are dentists, hygienists and therapists to work in the NHS and support this policy, which we have outlined on previous occasions. He will be aware, as the BDA is, that we are currently reviewing the work force requirements for dentists and other health care professionals. We want to ensure that we have proper, strategic long-term planning. </p>
<p> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we have already provided for an additional 150 training places for dental therapists to be established next year. That is the first instalment of the long-term approach that must be taken by the Government, the NHS and the higher and further education providers to make sure that we have an adequately skilled and sufficiently large group of workers to ensure that NHS dentistry can continue to play the role that we want it to play. </p>

<p> I hope that we can do that soon. It depends on the work that is done and the progress that has been made. It is a very important piece of work. As the hon. Gentleman will know from his time in the NHS, work force planning has not been one of our greatest strengths. It is a complicated field, and we have never performed very well in the past, so we are now trying to plan effectively. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is one of those who would counsel us to ensure that we get it right this time rather than rushing something out. That is how we used to do it, and it is not how we want to do things in future.</p>

<p> I would like to make it plain from the outset that these are probing, but important, amendments. They were drafted by the BDA, and they give us an opportunity to discuss preventive dental care among children and young people. In the explanatory briefings that the Minister kindly made available to us on Tuesday, he pointed out that the Government's intention is that the regulations that will flow from this clause are likely to cover school screening, oral health promotion and local oral health surveys. I assume, therefore, that he will welcome the amendments because they directly reflect his intentions.</p>
<p> It is crucial that the regulations contain those elements when, at the appropriate time, they are drafted and published, because it is quite extraordinary that, although we live in what John Kenneth Galbraith described as ''the affluent society'', the health care, particularly the dental health care, of our children in this developed nation is deteriorating. One could argue at length about why that is happening, although I do not intend to do so today. Sadly, I suspect that it has nothing to do with funding or the fact that the service is provided by a Government body&mdash;the NHS. I believe that it has more to do with education and ignorance and with other problems associated with poverty in certain areas of the country. </p>
<p> It strikes me as odd and contradictory that, when standards of living in this country have been improving for many years, a section of the community is still failing to move with the times and to ensure the dental health of their children and, in many cases, themselves. That is why preventive initiatives designed to bring home to people the importance of basic oral hygiene are crucial. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman seems to be laying the blame for the poor dental health of children in some parts of the county at the door of parents. Leaving that aside for a moment, his amendments propose a duty of oral health promotion. Does he envisage that that might involve PCTs promoting water fluoridation, which has been proven to be the safest and most effective method of improving dental health?</p>

<p> I am grateful for that guidance, because I do not want to go down that route today.</p>
<p> To ensure that there is no misunderstanding on the part of anyone who reads the report of the proceedings, I point out that the hon. Gentleman's statement that I blame parents gives a distorted view of the point that I was making. I am sure that he did not do that intentionally. I said that, sadly, through ignorance or lack of knowledge or for other reasons, too many people are not carrying out their responsibility as parents, either as well as they should or, in some cases, at all, to ensure that their children are familiar with oral and dental hygiene, and clean their teeth regularly each day. That fact struck me as ironic, given that we live in a society in which living standards, educational standards and the </p>
<p> awareness of health requirements have improved significantly over several decades. Something is failing: the message of the importance of oral hygiene and of caring for one's teeth is not getting across sufficiently to the population, and to certain sections of it in particular. </p>
<p> Dental health is not simply a question of how many fillings one needs before the age of 15; by having high standards of dental care and oral hygiene one can avoid, or detect at an early stage, other medical problems, which can be identified through regular dental check-ups. Far too many people do not fully appreciate that a dental check-up is not simply a procedure that one goes through to find out whether one needs a filling. It is also an opportunity for dental staff to identify potential mainstream health problems or further dental problems, or to confirm that there are no other problems. </p>
<p> That is why it is important to make the maximum effort to ensure that we raise standards through education, screening in schools and other community-based initiatives. We must get the message across to the many people who missed or did not appreciate its importance, which is that dental and oral hygiene and the care of one's teeth are crucial not only to avoid the pain of a tooth that needs to be filled, but because of the other health implications. </p>

<p> Although oral health is important in the preventative sense, it must be put into its proper context, which is that one can detect a finite number of oral diseases.</p>
<p> Who will be responsible for dental public health? Primary care trusts have directors of public health whose functions and, I suspect, priorities, are clearly defined. I fear that the priority that is accorded to dental public health will be limited, given that there is nobody obvious in primary care trusts who can develop dental health. My hon. Friend is correct to point out that there is widespread misunderstanding among the public at large about the importance of public health. However, I suspect that that is also true of the medical profession, which staffs public health posts. It is important that the Minister tells us how he envisages directors of public health developing programmes in dental public health. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling these amendments, because it gives me the opportunity to place on the record the Government's intentions.</p>
<p> Many of those duties are set out in section 5 of the National Health Service Act 1977. However, it specifically relates to those duties that are given to the Secretary of State that he then delegates to the primary care trusts. Clause 158 seeks to confer those duties directly to the primary care trusts, and that is in line with our policy of ascertaining where power and responsibility should properly lie in the NHS. </p>
<p> In changing the function from one that is delegated by the Secretary of State to one that is directly conferred on primary care trusts, we have chosen to draft those changes as regulations, rather than putting them in the Bill. I know that this is a wearisome argument, and I apologise in advance for making it, </p>
<p> but we have drafted those changes in that way not because we no longer wish to provide those functions&mdash;they are important in developing and maintaining high oral health standards&mdash;but because it gives us the flexibility that we need to ensure that the regulations reflect changes in practice, as well as advances in the development of services. </p>
<p> I do not have as rigid a view on this as I have on some of the other amendments. I am prepared to have another look at this matter to see whether it would make more sense to put it in the Bill. Flexibility means that it is better to include those functions in the regulations. I can at least confirm again&mdash;as I did on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Atkinson&mdash;that if we decide to proceed with the regulatory-making power rather than converting anything onto the Bill, which would be my preference, those regulations would cover the matters that the hon. Gentleman's amendment raised; oral health promotion, school dental screening and local oral health service. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) raised a fair and important point about who will actually carry out this work, and mentioned the relationship between that and the wider public health functions of the primary care trusts. It is important to bear in mind that primary care trusts are now responsible for community dental services and the bulk of the public health function is carried out within, from and through community dental services. That will continue in one way, shape or form, either through primary care trust direct services under the Bill&mdash;which is another option&mdash;or as community dental services. We have a cohort of skilled oral public health practitioners who will continue to do that work. </p>
<p> It will be the job of the public health directors in the PCT to co-ordinate that work, and to ensure that it has been done properly and effectively. It is not the case that there is no one there to do that work; those functions are currently being discharged through the community dental service. I very much hope that those practitioners will continue to work under this new format, and I am confident that they will. Oral public health is a sector in which there is much professional expertise, and in which many skilled practitioners work. I hope that the new legal framework that we are creating for dental services within the NHS will boost oral public health; that is precisely what clause 158 is designed to do. </p>

<p> With your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, I wish to deal with a point raised by the hon. Member for Westbury. He asked who would carry out this function. An important aspect of the Bill is that, for the first time, general dental service practitioners will be allowed to </p>

<p> Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill </p>

<p> In contrast to clause 158, subsections (5) and (6) of new section 16CA contained in clause 157 specifically provide for regulations, their purpose and scope. New section 16CB contained in clause 158 mentions prescribed functions in subsections (1), (2) and (3), but does not mention where the regulations that set out those functions are, or where the regulation-making power is. I assume that the Government are relying on a general regulation-making power somewhere in this part of the Bill, and perhaps there is a general provision in the Bill. I looked for it, but could not find it.</p>
<p> Given that the issues are similar&mdash;indeed, we have just debated what dental public services should provide&mdash;why does new section 16CB not include descriptive subsections about regulations equivalent to those subsections included in new section 16CA? New section 16CA(6) mentions ''the manner or circumstances'' in which some of the dental public health services might be provided. I hope that my question is clear, and that the Minister can answer it; if not now, then later. </p>

<p> It is important to bear in mind that all those amendments are insertions into the 1977 legislation. In this case, I understand that the regulation-making power is contained in the 1977 Act. The Secretary of State&mdash;or, where appropriate, the National Assembly for Wales&mdash;has the power to make those regulations.</p>

<p> I know that there are general regulation-making powers in this Bill and in the 1977 Act. Why has specific provision been made for regulations in new section 16CA but not in new section 16CB? Presumably such provision was not felt necessary, or perhaps it is redundant in new section 16CA. When a subsection mentions functions that may be prescribed, I check whether there is anything specific about the regulation-making power. The Government are not generally reluctant to give themselves specific regulation-making powers and descriptions of how those regulations are provided for. Why the distinction in the treatment of the two areas?</p>
</speech>

<p> It relates to the specific circumstances of the two different duties. Subsection (6) of new section 16CA has been included because we want it to cover that ground. I gave an example of weekday services and the hours in which they are provided. Section 128 of the 1977 Act sets out a general regulation-making power, and I am confident that the powers to make regulations under the 1977 Act give us the necessary flexibility and reach. We included new section 16CA(6) because we did not have that power, and we feel that we were right to include it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.6.16" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" speakername="Evan Harris" time="10:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s09.htm" colnum="873">
<p> On that basis, will the Minister consider whether&mdash;if he did not feel that the general powers were sufficient to provide for those proposed in section 16CA(6)&mdash;there are similar issues relating to the manner and circumstances by which dental public health services are provided, such as those listed in the amendments we have just discussed? If he agrees that there are, will he consider including equivalent regulation-making powers or qualifications to section 16CA(6) in clause 158, so that we can be certain that there will be the ability to make regulations that will</p>
<p><span class="indent">''describe services by reference to the manner or circumstances in which they are provided.''?</span></p>
<p> That is even more important in the provision of some of these services than in terms of primary dental services. </p>

<p> The amendments make minor and technical changes to section 28M of the National Health Act 1977, ''Persons eligible to enter into GDS contracts''; in particular to the conditions that are to apply to those who may become contractors under a GDS contract.</p>
<p> General dental services may be provided by a dental practitioner, a dental corporation or a partnership including at least one dental practitioner, and any of those people listed in section 28M(2)(b)(i) to (iii). Amendment No. 616 changes the wording of section 28M(2)(b)(iii) to make clear that health care professionals who work for the health service in any capacity are eligible to seek GDS contracts as a member of such a partnership. The existing wording might have implied that they had to have a contract to provide services in the health service when, in fact, it does not matter whether they are working for the health service as employees, contractors or on any other basis. The important point is that they are engaged in providing services for the health service. That was always our intention and I hope that is now put beyond all doubt. </p>
<p> The amendments would add existing providers under a GDS or PDS contract to the list of potential providers of GDS contracts. Otherwise, it is possible that providers&mdash;such as practice managers, who are parties to GDS contracts&mdash;would not be able to seek </p>
<p> new contracts because they may not fall into any of the existing categories. We want to avoid that situation. </p>
<p> The amendment also makes provision to cover the situation where a person, such as a practice manager, was a provider of GDS, but that contract terminated before a new contract was agreed. The exercise of the power will allow such a person to enter into a new contract for a prescribed period&mdash;for example, three or four months or longer&mdash;after the ending of the first contract. That is notwithstanding the fact that he is not currently a provider, and is simply an avoidance of that provision. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 617 enables regulations to cover the situation where there is a change in a partnership whose members hold a GDS contract; for example, where one of the partners leaves or a new partner joins the practice. It is intended to avoid an unnecessary renegotiation of the contract. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 618 alters the definition of a dental corporation in line with that which appears elsewhere in the 1977 Act. That was an oversight. The purpose of amendment No. 620 is to adjust the definition of an NHS employee in relation to a GDS contract to ensure consistency with the same definition that applies in relation to primary dental services. </p>

<p> The effect of clause 160 is to set out the transitional arrangements for general dental services.</p>
<p> The clause gives the Government powers to make orders to ensure a smooth transitional period between </p>

<p> I shall not rehearse my arguments about the pros and cons of affirmative rather than negative resolutions again because the Minister has heard those arguments many times in various Committees in recent years. Those arguments, with which he is familiar, still hold good. However, given the importance of those orders and what they will do, will the Minister reconsider and make the orders subject to affirmative rather than negative resolutions, so that, when they are made, Parliament will have the opportunity to debate in detail the Government's proposals to ensure that they are getting it right? </p>

<p> I can give the hon. Member for West Chelmsford that assurance. We shall look at the matter and consider whether it is the right way to proceed.

<p> I hope that these amendments will improve the effectiveness of the primary care trusts and their ability to control their performance lists. Amendment No. 621 will enable regulations made under section 28Q(3) to ensure that, where a performer is subject to an inquiry into efficiency and fraud, that performer cannot circumvent the investigation by simply removing his or her name from the list. It would not be in the public interest for the Government to allow that to happen, and I hope that members of the Committee will sign up to that.</p>
<p> Amendment No. 622 makes it clear that the information disclosed about applications to be included on the list should include information about applications that have also been granted. That is a natural counterpart to information about refusals, and it will provide a fair and more evenly balanced system. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 623 makes it clear that information about applications for inclusion on a list may be shared with the Secretary of State, primary care trusts and local health boards. That is necessary in order to ensure that a performer, under sanctions </p>

<p> I am very happy to do that. Essentially, the clause paves the way for a new special health authority to be established to take on the functions and responsibilities of the Dental Practice Board. These two new functions are needed to enable the new special health authority to be established as a successor body to the DPB to undertake the functions needed in relation to primary dental services.</p>
<p> Subsection (1) amends section 11 of the National Health Service Act 1977, under which a special health authority is established, having reference to the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997. This will allow, very simply, for a new special health authority that replaces the DPB and takes on its functions in relation to primary dental service pilot arrangements. </p>
<p> Subsection (2) amends section 16(b) of the 1977 Act in relation to the exercise of functions by primary care trusts. An order may provide for the transfer to a special health authority of the rights and liabilities of a primary care trust under a general dental services contract, where the special health authority is to exercise functions on its behalf, and for their transfer back where the authority ceases to exercise those functions. </p>
<p> Subsection (3) makes similar provision in relation to local health boards in Wales. It proposes a simple series of technical provisions to allow the new special health authorities that will take on the work of the DPB to do that within a proper legal context. In that way, there will be no question marks over their jurisdiction and authority. </p>

<p> The Minister will agree that this is an important clause. I wish him to explain some of the background to this clause&mdash;as he has just done for clause 164&mdash;which deals with charges for dental services. A new schedule has been incorporated into the clause, which, according to the explanatory notes, makes some changes to the existing charging arrangements. I should be grateful if the Minister clarified what those changes are and on what basis they have been proposed.</p>
<p> I should be grateful also if he explained, in as much detail as possible, what the significant changes are going to be, compared with the current charging arrangements by virtue of the change from an item per service. What are the Government's intentions in </p>
<p> relation to the range of charges and the income from those? </p>
<p> The Minister may be aware that NHS income from charges has increased steadily over the past six years; indeed, by just as much as it did in the six years before that. Making charges for NHS treatment is not consistent&mdash;generally speaking&mdash;with the commitment that the NHS should be free at the point of delivery. The two concepts are inconsistent. This is a case where NHS treatment is not free at the point of delivery. It is incumbent on the Government, from time to time, to defend their departure from that principle. </p>
<p> The Government should explain why, of the treatments that should be available on the NHS&mdash;as opposed to the treatments that are not considered to be worth having on the NHS&mdash;the Government consider it to be legitimate to levy charges for treatment for the mouth and teeth, but not legitimate to levy charges for treatments for other parts of the body. That requires explanation, particularly given that, in the Bill, they are bringing dental practitioners on to a similar&mdash;although not identical&mdash;basis to that of primary care practitioners on the medical side. That is unless it is the Government's intention not to rule out the possibility of extending co-payment to other areas. </p>
<p> I will not go into the detail of the concerns that have been raised about the Prime Minister's thinking when he referred, in a document, to more co-payment. The Government now say that in the foreword to that book, he was talking about education and not health as far as public services are concerned. It may reassure the Committee&mdash;it would certainly reassure me&mdash;if the Minister explained the general position on co-payment and in particular how that is changing with regard to dental care. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that. </p>

<p> The current law&mdash;section 79A of the 1977 Act&mdash;provides for the charge to be paid by a patient for dental treatment under GDS to be based on the remuneration paid to the dentist. In particular, the existing regulations provide for the charge to be calculated on an item of service basis. Patients, their representatives and others have told us forcibly that dental charges are unclear, are difficult to understand and raise concerns about the potential costs of treatment. A recent survey undertaken by the British Dental Health Foundation found that two thirds of people were ignorant about dental charges, and I would include myself among that body.</p>
<p> Even more worrying is the Office of Fair Trading's comment in its recently published report on the private dentistry market in the UK that poor price transparency can encourage potentially unnecessary treatment or treatment that is of a higher or lower quality than the consumer would wish. If that is true in the private market, it is equally true in the NHS. In the Bill, we are attempting to provide a regime that is clearer, more transparent and simpler to understand. In future, dental charges will continue to bear a relation to the level of service provided&mdash;such as a charge per course of treatment or per visit&mdash;but will no </p>
<p> longer be explicitly related to the dentist's remuneration. </p>
<p> The new arrangements will apply nationally. They are not intended to increase the level of charges but to ensure greater clarity for both dentists and the public about the cost of treatment. I will be establishing a working group, led by Harry Cayton&mdash;the director of Patient Experience and Public Involvement, who recently joined the Department from the Alzheimer's Disease Society&mdash;to undertake a review of the charging regime, as recommended in the recent Audit Commission report, ''Primary dental care services in England and Wales''. Decisions on the structure of the new charging regime will be informed by the findings; they are not specifically provided for in the Bill. </p>

<p> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation, and I interrupt him only to raise two issues. First, he qualified matters by saying that generally it is not the intention that existing charges will be higher under the new regime. Given the changes that are involved in moving away from an item of service payment to a national tariff, can the Minister guarantee that no course of treatment will be charged at a higher rate than at present?</p>
<p> I shall come to my second point after the Minister has responded. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-05-13_E_21-0_2003-06-19a.18.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/987" speakername="John Hutton" time="11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/e/st030619/am/30619s11.htm" colnum="879">
<p> I look forward to the second point.</p>
<p> There will be no new charges for NHS treatment. The Bill does not pave the way for increases in NHS dental charges. How much is raised by charges for particular treatments and so forth is a matter for regular review. The Bill makes no provision for increasing the charges for dental treatment faced by NHS patients. I should also make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that I have tabled a new clause that will produce a new schedule 10 to the Bill. During the review and preparation of legislation, I was advised that schedule 10 was not comprehensive enough, given the amendments to earlier legislation. That is why I have tabled new schedule 2 and new schedule 10. </p>
<p> The difficulty is basically in relation to new schedule 2, and we will come to that shortly. That new wording is designed to replace references to GDS and some references to personal dental services with the new terminology of PDS, primary dental services. In going through the vast volume of NHS legislation, we found that we had not corrected and tidied up all of those references. </p>
<p> In relation to dental charges, I can say little more than I have already said about how we intend the new regime to operate. </p>
<p> I have set out the general principles, and a detailed review of those provisions is about to start. </p>
<p> The hon. Gentleman asked me the wider question of why there should be NHS dental charges at all. Perhaps he will be able to enlighten us as to whether it is now Liberal Democrat policy that there should be no charges and where that money will come from. However, I shall return to his wider point in a second. </p>

<p> I understand that the intention is not to specify the nature of the new charging regime but to allow that to</p>
<p> emerge from the review. To ensure that the structure of the legislation does not constrain the review, will the Minister confirm that, notwithstanding the exemptions for certain persons in schedule 12 of the 1977 Act, the charging regime, in shifting away from items of service, is not only capable of setting maximum amounts of courses of treatment or items of service but maximum amounts for individuals who may be receiving dental services?</p>

<p> I shall have to come back to the Committee on that point or perhaps write to the hon. Gentleman. It is quite a technical question, and I do not want to mislead him or the Committee.</p>
<p> Let me make one or two points clear about the wider question of NHS dental charges. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it absolutely clear that there are no Government proposals to extend co-payment. That was a bit of mischief-making from the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, which we do not usually expect from him. </p>
<p> All I can say is that the view of successive Governments for over 50 years has been that it is appropriate for people who can afford to make a contribution to the cost of their dental treatment to be asked to do so. There is an extensive list of exemptions, to which the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) referred. We ensure that people with limited means who are not in a position to make such a contribution are not asked to do so, and those exemptions will continue. This clause and the schedule, which we shall come to in a minute, will have no effect either on the groups that are currently exempted or on those who receive health costs under the low-income scheme. </p>

<p> I accept the Minister's question about our policy. On a clause stand part debate, it is reasonable for me to ask him about his policy. Does he accept the premise, for better or worse, that co-payments for those who can afford it for this type of NHS treatment are inconsistent with the argument that the NHS is free at the point of delivery for this treatment?</p>
<p> Does the Minister accept, as anyone who supports charges for NHS treatment must, that despite there being a range of exemptions&mdash;these are merely exemptions because there is no income-related sliding scale&mdash;this is regressive in two ways? First, it is regressive for people who fall just outside the exemption but are not very well off, and, secondly, it is regressive for people who have continuing dental health problems that require them to have more treatment than other people in the same income bracket who are blessed with better dental health. Will he at least accept the fact that those issues exist? </p>

<p> Of course I accept the fact that those issues exist; that is blindingly obvious. However, we must keep our feet on the ground during this type of debate. In my experience, the hon. Gentleman likes to come to Committees such as this and to other places and develop the argument that there should not be co-payments. However, as we all know from dealing with Liberal Democrat councillors on social services issues, Liberal Democrats come here and say one thing but</p>
<p> unfortunately they do completely the opposite when they are given an opportunity in power or authority to make actual decisions. [Interruption.] I detect a little support for that argument.</p>
<p> However, we are not talking about social services; we are talking, in the hon. Gentleman's language, the wider language of co-payment. As ever, he wants to pick and choose the argument that he wants to make, ignoring Liberal Democrat practice and instead focusing on Liberal Democrat rhetoric. That might work on some audiences, but I am glad to say that it will never work on a sophisticated audience such as the membership of this Committee. </p>

<p> When we published the Bill, as I made clear in the debate on the previous group of amendments, parliamentary counsel had the huge and laborious task of ensuring that all existing health legislation that identified references to general dental services and personal dental services on the statute book, and other financial and administrative references, reflected the new terminology and language contained in the Bill.</p>
<p> New schedule 2 will effectively replace schedule 10, which I hope that the Committee will remove from the Bill. I want to reassure the Committee that new schedule 2 contains minor technical and consequential amendments, which are needed to establish integrated primary dental services. The new schedule contains amendments consequential upon the new responsibilities for PCTs, in relation to the provision of primary dental services. The new dental public health functions are affected by clauses 157 and 158. As I said, the new concept of primary dental services needs to be reflected elsewhere in the statute book. That is essentially what my new schedule 2 seeks to do. </p>
<p> There are, however, three additional changes that I must bring to hon. Members' attention. I hope that my doing so will address the points made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. First, in paragraph 19 of the schedule, the aim of the significant redrafting of provisions for the establishment and recognition of local dental committees in England and Wales was to improve clarity. Existing sections 44 and 45 of the 1977 Act have been subject to repeated amendment as we have pressed ahead with our reform of NHS legislation. I am glad to say, Mr. Atkinson, and I am sure that the Committee will agree, that the </p>
<p> establishment of an integrated primary dental service provided the opportunity for a rewrite. We have sought not to change the way in which dentists are represented locally but to align that with the way in which the new service will be delivered. Local dental committees will be representative of dentists who are providing services under a general dental services contract. Others who provide or perform services may also choose to be represented. </p>
<p> Secondly, paragraph 36 of new schedule 2 replaces existing exemptions for providers of primary dental services from the restrictions to carry on the business of dentistry, which will allow non-dentists to hold a PDS contract. There is also a new form of words to include providers under a GDS contract. If we are to encourage team working and are to extend the opportunity to be involved in NHS dental service provisions to other health care professionals, it is important that the change be made. </p>
<p> Finally, paragraph 52 contains a minor consequential amendment to a provision in the Education Act 1996 that relates to co-operation on school dental inspections. That amendment is needed because the Secretary of State's previous functions, by virtue of clause 158, will in future become a primary care trust responsibility. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 624 completes the repeals and revocations in schedule 12. Those repeals and revocations are consequential on the replacement of sections 35 and 36 on general dental services in the 1977 Act, abolition of the Dental Practice Board, the new dental charging regime and the updating of PDS legislation in order to make its delivery effective in the new world in which we live. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 625 simply improves the drafting of the Bill. Its provisions generally apply to England and Wales. However, where consequential amendments and repeals to the Bill are required under clause 180, that clause will provide that the extent of such an amendment will be the same as the original provision. That is usually desirable, but in the case of the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997, which extends to England, Wales and Scotland, we must make it clear that any consequential repeals or revocations affect provisions in England and Wales only. </p>

In order to allow the continued development of high street specialist practices&mdash;for example, those that are limited to orthodontics&mdash;and to give dentists the maximum choice concerning their contractual arrangements, we have also taken the opportunity to commence the provisions in section 28C of the 1977 Act, which provides for so-called PDS permanence. That will bring local PDS contracts into the mainstream for the provision of primary dental services. It is our intention that no further PDS pilot schemes will be introduced and that all existing pilots will become PDS or GDS providers. Moreover, trust-led schemes will provide primary dental services under PCT dental services. It is necessary, therefore, to make several changes to the PDS provisions in sections 28C, </p>
<p>28D and 28E of the 1977 Act, in order to update them and bring them into line with the new duty on primary care trusts, in respect of primary dental services and the new general dental services contract provisions.</p>
