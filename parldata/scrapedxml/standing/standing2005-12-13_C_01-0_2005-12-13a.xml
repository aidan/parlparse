<p>Good morning, Mr. Bayley. I warmly welcome you to the Chair and am genuinely delighted that you will supervise this morning&rsquo;s discussion. I also welcome all members of the Committee, and the Opposition spokespeople. It seems that only last week we were in another Committee elsewhere&mdash;which, indeed, we were.</p>
<p>Several of my hon. Friends warmly supported the Bill on Second Reading. I am grateful to them; several Opposition Members who are present also took part in that debate. There is wide support for the Bill from many organisations, including from business. I look forward to a constructive debate that allows the Committee to scrutinise the Bill thoroughly. Members of the Committee will have noticed that the programme motion contains no knives, and no doubt they will welcome that. That gives us flexibility to consider fully issues that deserve particular discussion, and to move more swiftly over issues of lesser significance. I commend the motion to the Committee</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.3.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" speakername="Mark Prisk" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s01.htm" colnum="4">
<p> I am delighted that we are under your leadership, Mr. Bayley. I think this is the first time that I have been guided by you in the role of Chairman, and I look forward to that in the coming few days. I welcome both Ministers who are here today, and also my hon. Friend &nbsp; the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), who understands these issues far better than I ever shall. I am delighted to be here in her support.</p>
<p>We have before us up to six potential sittings; I know how much Labour Members are looking forward to the sittings on Tuesday next, as are Opposition Members. We will, I am sure, have the opportunity here for a full and thorough scrutiny of the issues. As the Minister rightly mentioned, we share much of the Government&rsquo;s view on the importance of the role of work and families. Indeed, we wish to ensure that the quality of the legislation before us is the best that we can manage. That is why we shall be asking questions to probe the Government&rsquo;s intentions and aims. Without such scrutiny, we would be failing in our duty. I am sure that Labour Members will wish to participate in that process.</p>
<p>Therefore, on this occasion&mdash;and I do not often get the chance to say this&mdash;I welcome the fact no timetable instruments, or knives as they are colloquially known, have been put into this motion. One simple reason that Opposition Members raise concerns about such timetables is that they interfere with the quality of the scrutiny process. It means that we sometimes have to guess which amendment we need to focus on to deal with the big issues, and often forces us to leave out smaller issues. Those may be particularly important to our constituents, but we nevertheless have no time for them because we are racing to catch up with those amendments which are perhaps at the back end of a timetable, or knife. Thus it is especially welcome that the motion before us today does not include such knives. I hope that means we shall be able to tease out the details here. We certainly look forward to a thorough and positive exchange.</p>

<p> May I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Bayley? It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I, too, welcome the two Ministers to this morning&rsquo;s debate and, although he did not welcome me in his introductory remarks, I welcome the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk).</p>
<p>We support the Bill&rsquo;s objectives. In many respects, it is an acknowledgment of the revolution that has occurred in the workplace from the days when it was dominated by men, who were the single breadwinners. The world has changed much since then when people worked full-time and were the sole breadwinners. There is an economic imperative for facilitating women remaining in employment, but in a way that also meets the needs of families and of children. There is equally a need to ensure that fathers are able to achieve a better work-life balance.</p>
<p>There are concerns about some of the Bill&rsquo;s details. There is clearly a need, probably shared on all parts, to ensure that we avoid over-burdensome obligations, particularly on small employers. One of the amendments that I have tabled seeks a way of reducing the burden on them. We must be alert to that, because although is it right to ensure that mothers and fathers can achieve the better work-life balance that we are all striving for, we must recognise that when any employee takes time off work, it has an impact on the &nbsp; employer. The impact is greatest on small employers, and everything must be done to ease the burden on them.</p>

<p> I am very grateful for that guidance, Mr. Bayley.</p>
<p> May I also briefly raise the concern that the Bill leaves an awful lot to regulations? Inevitably, there is a concern about that. The TUC, among others, has highlighted the vagueness of the Bill in that respect. In addition, there is nothing about the time scale for the introduction of regulations. The TUC also refers to the fact&mdash;</p>

<p> I thought that the Conservative spokesman made some general comments, and I was merely seeking to make general comments about the presentation of the Bill and the extent to which it relies on regulation. I take your guidance, Mr. Bayley, and I will not push you any further in this respect.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.5.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s01.htm" colnum="5">
<p> As I was saying, the Liberal Democrats very much support the increase in maternity leave proposed in the Bill. It seeks to increase the maximum period of maternity leave to one year. The indication is that that would be introduced by a phrased approach, by way of regulation. First, there would be an increase, by regulation, to nine months and then subsequently to a year by the end of this Parliament. That is a thoroughly sensible way of proceeding.</p>
<p>There is a problem with this new right, which, in a sense, relates to the level of pay. The level of pay for the bulk of the maternity leave is low: &#163;106 at present. There is inevitably a risk that, for many people, it will be impossible to take the full period of maternity leave to which they will be entitled. It may be that there should be a long-term objective of raising that level of pay in a way that is achievable given overall Government expenditure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, it seems that it is worth trying to find ways of putting the power into the hands of the woman taking maternity leave to choose, if she wants, to take a shorter period of maternity leave than the maximum at a higher rate of weekly pay. In other words, every woman who takes maternity leave should be entitled to the full amount of maternity pay that she would receive under the period allowed by the Bill&mdash;ultimately, one year. However, if she chooses, she should be able to take it over a shorter period at a higher weekly rate. That follows the Swedish approach, introducing more flexibility and enabling the woman to choose how she will take the leave while ensuring that every woman is entitled to the maximum amount of maternity pay that can be provided for over the maternity pay period.</p>
<p>Some women might not take the full maternity period, but, if my amendment is accepted, they might take more than they would be able to take financially under the unamended Bill. The risk that we face is that the entitlement that the Bill provides will be meaningless for a group of women who cannot afford to take the full period at &#163;106 per week. I appreciate that that figure will increase marginally year by year.</p>
<p>In my model, which introduces greater flexibility for the woman taking maternity leave, we may well see a situation in which a woman chooses to take nine months rather than a full year of maternity leave, but combines that with a request to the employer on returning for flexible working. In other words, we could envisage a phased return to the hours the woman chooses to work. Perhaps the woman could take nine months rather than a year, return on an agreed basis of flexible working to work two days a week and, if she is a full-time worker, increase that progressively until she is back full-time. In other words, it is about putting the power in the hands of the individual who is taking maternity leave.</p>
<p>I suspect that, under my proposal, the total bill for maternity pay that the Government would have to meet would be higher. In effect, we would be saying that every woman would be entitled to the full amount of statutory maternity pay, but that she might be able to take it over a shorter period. Will the Minister tell us whether a calculation has been done of the extra cost of the amendment? It would be a pity if it were rejected on cost grounds because the Government are facilitating women taking the full period of maternity leave. Therefore, in theory, they must support women being entitled to the full amount of statutory maternity pay. The reality under the Bill will be that not all women will be able to take that for economic and financial reasons.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.5.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" speakername="James McGovern" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s01.htm" colnum="5">
<p> I think that I understand the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s point, but there is a danger associated with it. I assume that we agree that the purpose of maternity leave is to allow the mother to spend time with her new child, but does not this amendment provide an incentive for the mother to spend less time with her new child?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.5.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" time="10:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s01.htm" colnum="5">
<p> I think that the opposite is the case. The power will be in the hands of the woman. Some women will be financially able to take the full amount of maternity leave, but Ministers must accept that the reality is that not all women can do that. Many women will have to take less than that because they cannot afford to be off work at such a rate of pay for the full one-year period.</p>
<p>This measure would mean that more women will be able to take more time off, and to choose how to do that. If we have a situation in which a proportion of women cannot afford to take a full year so they take significantly less than that, I am sure that the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern) would agree that that is not good. However, if the mother is able to take nine months at a higher weekly rate than for the full year, and that facilitates her taking the nine months off, perhaps combined with flexible working when she returns to work&mdash;a phased return&mdash;that will be a good thing that ensures that women are able to take more time off than would otherwise be the case.</p>

<p> To follow on from the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West, is there not a problem in that someone could take a very short period of time off for maternity leave in order to get back to work as soon as possible so as to get a &ldquo;windfall&rdquo; by receiving the contractual pay entitlement as well as statutory maternity pay for the period when they are entitled to that? That would encourage people to go back to work sooner, when the purpose of the Bill is to allow mothers to spend more time with their newborn child.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, and I accept it completely. This is a probing amendment. It is designed to initiate a debate, so that we can discover whether there is a way of introducing &nbsp; greater flexibility and of giving more power to the woman taking the maternity leave, instead of the provisions being something of a straitjacket.</p>
<p>The principle behind my amendment is a strong one: more power should be given to the woman. If that were to happen, more safeguards might be needed to ensure that the entitlements apply for a defined period, so as to avoid the windfall that the hon. Gentleman refers to. However, I hope that we would all accept the principle that more power should be given to the woman to decide how to take that period of leave.</p>
<p>We should adopt the Swedish approach: there should be as much flexibility as possible and the woman should be given the power to decide. The amendment gives the woman the power to decide and helps more women to take more leave, and it does not in any way compromise her entitlement.</p>
<p>The other amendments follow on similar lines. Amendment No. 11 would ensure that the same principle was applied to adoption pay. Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 relate to statutory paternity leave and pay. The Government&rsquo;s own assessment is that take-up of paternity leave will be very low. The regulatory impact assessment makes that very clear; I refer Members to pages 84 and 85 of the document. The prediction depends on whether the entitlement to additional paternity leave is based on 26 weeks&rsquo; service or 60 weeks&rsquo; service. If it is based on 60 weeks&rsquo; service, the Government&rsquo;s own prediction is that 9,000 to 13,000 fathers will take advantage of the entitlement. That is a tiny proportion of the total. If there were a 60-week employment requirement, the total eligible for leave would be 380,000 and the total eligible for pay would be 238,000. The total anticipated to take the entitlement would be 9,000 to 13,000&mdash;as a percentage, that is tiny. We can make all sorts of grand statements about how the entitlement will transform the workplace, but let us be honest about its anticipated impact: that is tiny.</p>

<p> I understand what the hon. Gentleman has said, but conversely is there not a different danger? If the Government assume that the take-up will be less than they have said, the costs could be dramatically different from those presented to us as we have considered this legislation. In other words, if the 9,000 were to become 18,000, that would make a radical difference to the cost, although I am not sure that it would double it. Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that an underestimation is involved, which could be to the detriment of small businesses in particular?</p>

<p> I welcome the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s intervention; what he says may well be the case. We all need to be honest about the issue: do we believe in fathers taking paternity leave? I strongly believe in the right being introduced, but if the Government&rsquo;s own estimate is that the take-up could be as low as 9,000, we shall not be introducing much of a right.</p>
<p>The danger is that the entitlement will be taken up only by those fathers who can afford to take time-off pay at that very low rate; it might become a middle-class entitlement and not one for people on lower &nbsp; earnings, who may have mortgage burdens and so on and simply not be able to afford to take the amount of leave provided for. If we are talking about trying to change the culture of the workplace and really ensuring that men are able to take time off and spend more time with their children during their early years, we have to do something effective to achieve that.</p>
<p>It seems much better to put the power in the hands of the father. I fully acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan); adjustments may be needed to ensure that the allowance is not all taken as a windfall. However, surely it is better for a father to take, say, nine weeks off rather than the full entitlement, but at a rate of pay that ensures that he can do so. That is better than not taking it at all. That is the risk that we face, which was acknowledged by the Government in their regulatory impact assessment.</p>
<p>The case is strong. In principle, if we can put the power in the hands of fathers&mdash;perhaps with more safeguards to ensure that the entitlement is not taken as a windfall&mdash;and ensure that they are able to take advantage of the entitlement, that would be a good thing in changing the culture of the workplace and ensuring that men&mdash;and women, when they take maternity or adoption leave&mdash;take advantage of those rights. At the end of the day, that is what we all want.</p>

<p> To observe the proper conventions, I should say that it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bayley. I welcome both Ministers. The Minister with responsibility for women and equality and I have probably spent more time together during the past six weeks than either of us have spent with any family at any time, so some of what we say this morning is said with heartfelt understanding.</p>
<p>Having said that, I strongly welcome the fact that the Government are taking all the measures that we have been debating and discussing in the past few months, because we thoroughly support the intent to help everyone to achieve the work-life balance that is essential not only to individuals and families but to business and the economy. That is a general point, however, wide of what we are now discussing. I shall not try your patience on it now, Mr. Bayley.</p>
<p>On the precise matter of amendment No. 11 and the others in the group, and the general assertions made by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), we agree in principle with what he just said. There may be differences of detail and, as ever, I make a cautionary point about how much public money could be spent, always bearing in mind that everything that we discuss in passing the Bill must be balanced with other matters on which we would want to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money. Still, in principle, I totally support what the hon. Gentleman said.</p>
<p>The fact is that all families are different. It is wrong for the Government to prescribe exactly how a new mother and father and family should behave, exactly how an employee should behave immediately after the birth of a child, how a family should balance its resources between the mother and father or anyone &nbsp; else in the family who is involved in the child&rsquo;s upbringing, and how all employers should deal with their employees.</p>
<p>Those matters require a degree of flexibility, because every family&mdash;every mother, father and child&mdash;and every employer is different, as is every employer-employee relationship. In particular, there is considerable variation between large employers with a human resources department and plenty of flexibility about replacing one employee with another temporarily and smaller employers that do not have the flexibility to allow that. Therefore, for the Government to prescribe precisely how maternity and paternity leave and pay should work is not the best approach. Everything that I say about maternity and paternity rights should of course apply also to adoption rights, as the hon. Member for North Norfolk said.</p>
<p>In particular, we previously proposed&mdash;and made it an important plank of our manifesto for the general election&mdash;that should a new mother, or, indeed, new father, wish to take maternity or paternity leave or pay, it should be possible for them to receive the amount that would have been paid over nine months in six months, or a period in between those two, as a way of providing the flexibility, choice and adaptability that would fit the rights to each family.</p>
<p>If the Government confer a right but it does not help a particular person or family at the relevant time, that is pointless. It might as well not be given if the family&mdash;or the employee or employer, or the child, father or mother&mdash;cannot benefit. Flexibility is the key factor in making those rights work. It is hard to imagine why the Government would argue against somebody taking the same amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money in maternity or paternity pay but taking it over a shorter period of time.</p>

<p> When would the mother decide the date of her return to work? It seems to me that if she wanted an increased payment, she would have to say so prior to the birth of the baby? Following the birth, the assessment could change and she might decide that she would need a longer period.</p>

<p> On that point, may I assist by way of referring to the amendment? I suggest that, so far as reasonably practicable, the payment is made in equal weekly instalments, but clearly we cannot prescribe beforehand exactly how long the woman would choose to be off. If there is a balance to be paid at the end, she would know that she would be entitled to it. That is the way that the amendment would work.</p>

<p> I thank the hon. Gentleman for clarifying exactly what his amendment says. As I said, I support his amendment in principle, but the detail will take further working out. It does not seem beyond the limits of practical administration that a new &nbsp; mother could, in the first few weeks after the baby&rsquo;s birth, claim her maternity pay, taking it over the nine-month rate per week but that that could then be changed if she wished to shorten her period of maternity leave. Why not?</p>
<p>We all pay too much tax. We all, from time to time, might pay too much tax and then have the tax code changed to take account of that and pay less tax over the next year or receive a rebate. The Exchequer can surely manage to do a simple calculation of an amount that is due. When I think about it, that is a wild hope on my part, given the way in which tax credits are working. In my constituency alone it would take hundreds of man hours of Inland Revenue time to sort out the problems in the tax credit system.</p>

<p> Has the hon. Lady not demonstrated the paradox in the argument of the hon. Member for North Norfolk? He is claiming that the problem with the paternity leave suggestion is that it will benefit middle-class fathers, yet the hon. Lady is saying that the problem with the maternity pay is that those who earn more than &#163;106 a week will not benefit, because a small amount of money is involved. Does she not recognise that some people earn small sums of money and will benefit from the SMP being extended over a nine-month period, rather than it simply benefiting those affluent people in her constituency by way of a windfall? Will this provision not benefit those who need it the most?</p>

<p> I am not giving way to the hon. Member for Tooting, who seems to be making up what I have said. He is having hallucinations about what I am saying. I said that I see no reason why a woman who wishes to take maternity leave over nine months should not be able to do so. Of course, she might not wish to do so&mdash;we have to allow for different circumstances; every family, employment situation and child is different and it makes a huge difference if a mother has a healthy child who does all the things that small babies are meant to do and sleeps through the night at three months. That is all wonderful. I wish that my four-year-old had slept through the night last night, but that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>How very different is the situation if a mother thinks that she is going to have a baby with whom there will be no problem, but it has even a small health problem. That changes the picture completely. Therefore, flexibility is very important. I see no reason why there should not be choice and flexibility if somebody wishes to take only six months away from work, whatever the reason. It might be because she or he does not feel the need to spend more than six months at home with the child because there are brilliantly competent grandparents to help or something along those lines, or it might be that the parent has a particular project or issue in the workplace that he or she wishes to deal with and therefore wishes to go back to work sooner; and why not?</p>

<p> Are we suggesting that there should be a default position? I can see hon. Members raising concerns about the fact that the total sum over a year is &#163;5,512 and that a woman might decide to go back after two months and to receive &#163;4,000 and that we would not want to encourage that. However, some flexibility would be good. Perhaps a default position of six or nine months would allay some of the concerns that have been expressed today.</p>

<p> My hon. Friend makes a good point. One of the problems is that we are dealing with generalities, not with the precise way in which this will be constructed. At a later point in the debate, I shall make a point about the need for very detailed regulations to be brought before the House. Flexibility and choice are what matter if families are to achieve a work-life balance. Every situation is different from every other, every family is different, every employer is different, and every child is different. Therefore, it is right to introduce choice and flexibility.</p>
<p>I should also say that every economic situation is different. For some people, because of their financial circumstances, basic maternity pay is sufficient and for some it is not. If they wish to top up that amount&mdash;for example, by working more&mdash;why should they not be able to do so? It should not be for the Government to prescribe exactly how each citizen lives his or her life at any one time. It is for the people to choose how to live their lives and for the Government to be an enabler. The amendments proposed by the hon. Member for North Norfolk enable them to have the choice and flexibility that, in principle, we support.</p>

<p> I am delighted that we have had such a lively start to the Committee. These amendments seek to allow employees to choose the period over which they will receive their statutory maternity, adoption or additional statutory paternity pay. From April 2007, women who are expecting babies and adopters with whom children are placed will be able to receive up to 39 weeks&rsquo; statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance or statutory adoption pay after the Bill becomes law.</p>
<p>The amount of additional statutory paternity pay that a father or partner of an adopter may receive will depend on the detail of the scheme, which will be subject to further consultation. I note the concern expressed by the hon. Member for North Norfolk that the Bill deals with a range of regulations, but they will enable us to get the detail right through more consultation.</p>

<p> It is, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to wait for our discussion later on. I am sure that he will receive a better response from my hon. Friend the Minister with the policy lead on that issue. It is good that we can work together on these things.</p>
<p>My comments, which are general, will explain the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s opposition to the amendments on statutory maternity and adoption pay and to the amendments on additional statutory paternity pay. The amendment seeks to allow employees to receive the same total payment but in a fewer weeks. The net effect would be that the employee would receive a higher amount each week if they chose a shorter period.</p>
<p>Maternity pay has a particular purpose, to which we must keep returning. It provides an element of wage replacement to help women to take time off work to prepare for and recover from the birth of their child. Adoption pay also has a particular purpose in that it provides an element of wage replacement to help adopters to take time off work to bond with the child, or indeed, children&mdash;sibling groups are often placed together for adoption&mdash;and to settle the child or children into their new home, which is an enormously important task for some of the most vulnerable children in our society.</p>
<p>The first months of a child&rsquo;s life are very important to a mother, and the Government are keen to encourage employees to take as long as they want and need around the birth or placement of the child. We estimate that only about 16 per cent. of women&mdash;about 50,000 women&mdash;take less than 26 weeks&rsquo; maternity leave. By extending the pay period to 39 &nbsp; weeks, we are helping working parents to take more time off in the first year of their child&rsquo;s life. Evidence shows that most mothers take their paid maternity leave, and it is our priority to extend paid leave to help them to take more if that is right for them.</p>

<p> Building on that point, I see some merit in telling a woman that taking the maximum amount of maternity pay over nine months would be the total pot of money for which they would be eligible, but it would insert an element of flexibility into the provision if that woman were allowed to have access to that pot at a variable rate for between six and nine months. That would provide some choice, but it would not be the free-for-all that it would be if the women worked for one month and then took the whole pot of money. The provision to allow the woman to take the money for between six and nine months could be varied, but the woman would have access to the total amount of money, whether she took it over nine months or over eight, seven or six months.</p>

<p> I very much appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) is entering into the debate and seeking to achieve a sensible balance. I agree that flexibility and choice are very important, but I shall respond to his point when I say why the Government are resisting such a flexible approach.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for North Norfolk talked about the amount of money going to people&rsquo;s families. I emphasise that, in addition to statutory maternity pay, we should also consider the fact that families now receive additional money. The tax credits introduced in April 2003 are more generous and inclusive than any previous system of income-based financial support.</p>

<p> Would the hon. Gentleman be patient for a moment?</p>
<p>The value of child benefit has gone up by 25 per cent. since 1997, so families in the poorest fifth of the population are better off by an average of &#163;3,200 a year. As a result of tax credits, about four in 10 families in Britain effectively pay no net tax. That number has risen by about 500,000 since 1997. It is wrong to say that the only money available to families is statutory maternity pay, which brings me back to the point that statutory maternity pay is wage replacement. As the hon. Gentleman knows, tax credits go way up the pay scale; but supporting families, and particularly families on lower incomes, is a completely different matter.</p>

<p> I fully acknowledge that there is other income apart from the tax credits, but bearing in mind what the regulatory impact assessment says about the limited take-up of paternity leave, does the Minister none the less accept that some people will not take maternity leave or paternity leave because of the level of their pay?</p>

<p> I was going to deal with the issue a little later, but the hon. Gentleman has raised it in an intervention.</p>
<p>We know that culture and people&rsquo;s attitudes change over time. I do not say this to reflect badly on my late father, but when my brother was about to be born my mum rang for the ambulance; he packed her off in the ambulance and then went back to bed. Someone had to wake him to tell him of the phone call saying that his first-born son had arrived. My father loved his children very much, and he spent a great deal of time with us. However, that was the culture of nearly 50 years ago. Times change.</p>
<p>We are moving on from the introduction of paid paternity leave, of which there used to be none, to a system that will allow fathers to spend more time with their families if they so choose. Our estimate of what we think will happen is obviously based on current trends. There will be any number of reasons why fathers might or might not choose to spend time with their newborn child. As the hon. Member for Epping Forest said, we are talking about families, but each family is different, and they make different choices. We have estimated what we think will happen. It would be a positive thing from my perspective if more fathers took the opportunity of paid paternity leave, but I think that things will change over time. We are at the starting point. I shall now make some progress.</p>
<p>The majority of women start their maternity leave before their child is born. If we were to adopt the amendment, the amount of money that a woman received each week would depend on when she had decided to return to work&mdash;and if the amendment is accepted, that decision would have to taken before the child was born. That would make it difficult to adapt to the changed circumstances that the arrival of a child can bring.</p>
<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West said earlier that the birth of a child can bring a great many changes to a family. A woman may start her maternity leave and start receiving her maternity pay up to 11 weeks before the baby is due. She may decide at that point to return to work after 26 weeks&rsquo; pay, which would be 15 weeks after the baby was born. However, the baby may be born late, or have health problems, and she may decide after the birth that she would prefer to stay at home for the next six months. In such cases, the maternity pay would run out about three months after the birth, requiring the mother to return to work at a point that had become unsuitable, despite her original judgment. Similarly, if she chose to return to work earlier than she originally intended, her employer would need to recalculate the payment and pay the arrears due; that would increase the complexities for her employer.</p>

<p> I appreciate what the Minister says, but is it not better to give a bit more work to those who administer the public funds than to deprive families and parents of necessary flexibility?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.5.39" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" time="11:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s02.htm" colnum="16">
<p> We will discuss in a moment the difficulties of calculation and the impact of that on business and maternity payments, but this comes &nbsp; down to principles. The first principle is that maternity pay is wage replacement. We know that, setting out from that basis, families can calculate their financial situations and how much money they will have a week to manage their new situation. As for the level of maternity pay, I say to the hon. Member for North Norfolk that that has increased&mdash;the amount is somewhere among the deluge of bits of papers that I have been helpfully been provided with; ah, here it is&mdash;from &#163;60.20 in 2001 to &#163;106 now. That is a 70 per cent. increase. We should welcome that. In addition, there are other children&rsquo;s benefits. That is the principle; I will come to the impact that the amendments would have on business.</p>
<p> Another consequence of the amendment&mdash;I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting referred to this and used the term &ldquo;windfall&rdquo; in the first place, but I do not want to be the referee of a dispute across the Committee&mdash;would be that a woman who took only the compulsory two weeks after the birth would be entitled to receive 39 weeks&rsquo; pay for those two weeks. That means that a woman who earns over &#163;30,000 a year could receive over &#163;6,000 in statutory maternity pay for those two weeks, and then return to work and continue to receive her normal salary. The Government would fund at least 92 per cent. of the payment for those two weeks&mdash;the hon. Member for Epping Forest has, rightly, constantly reminded me over the past three or four weeks of the importance of taking care of public money, although it might seem like six weeks to her&mdash;and the woman&rsquo;s employer would have to fund 8 per cent. of that payment and continue to pay her salary or wages when she returned to work.</p>

<p> The Minister is addressing the comments of the hon. Member for North Norfolk on the amendments; I simply want to make it clear that our position is that the nine months could be varied not to two or three weeks but to six months, or to seven or eight months or thereabouts.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.5.41" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" time="11:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s02.htm" colnum="16">
<p> I understand that that is completely different to what is proposed in the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s amendments. I am sure that when we come to discuss the periods of extension in detail, we can deal with the issue of whether six months or nine months is appropriate, and with the interplay between the father and the mother in that situation.</p>
<p>As well as presenting employees with potentially difficult decisions, the amendment would add complexity for employers, who would need to calculate a different weekly rate for each employee depending on the length of time that they chose to receive their statutory pay. In addition, if we were to accept the amendments and allow employees to change their minds mid-receipt, even in limited circumstances employers would be faced with yet another recalculation of their statutory pay. Opposition Members regularly make points about the cost to business of regulation and the changes and difficulties around that. We seek to find the right balance in the Bill regarding giving families flexibility. As the hon. Member for Epping Forest rightly said, &nbsp; every family is different and they should all have the ability within a clear framework to make decisions about what is right for them. There must be that clear framework to enable families to understand to what they could be entitled, how to access the money and what the benefits would be for them individually.</p>
<p>Clarity must also exist for business. Without it, the cost to business would be enormous. Members of the Committee rightly referred to the issues that affect small businesses. I have only small businesses in my constituency. There are no large employers, so I know very well that the biggest problems are caused by issues that employers deal with only periodically. For most small employers, maternity leave issues come up only every so often. In dealing with maternity leave or a disciplinary matter, a small business will probably have to start from scratch and inform itself of what it needs to do. The greater the complexity that we put into such matters, the more difficult we will make it for small businesses and the more costly it will be for them.</p>

<p> We have considered that, and the overall costs to provide that service to businesses are prohibitive. Other mechanisms are in place to assist businesses, the detail of which is I am sure on another bit of paper to which we shall perhaps return. It concerns the process of assisting small businesses to undertake calculations, confirming those calculations and having help at the end of a telephone. I or my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for employment relations, consumers and fair markets will come back with more detail about the mechanisms that are in place. We recognise that matters are difficult for small businesses and we want to provide as much help as we can. However, we have to be mindful of the costs.</p>

<p> Is my hon. Friend aware of the report of the Cardiff business school in the Welsh Economic Review about the impact of the Bill on small businesses in Wales? It does not regard the Bill as a burden on small businesses in Wales. In fact, it concludes that it will be of benefit.</p>

<p> I am delighted that my hon. Friend drew my attention to the report. Despite my recent visit to Wales, of which she is aware, that was not one of the documents that was drawn to my attention.

<p> The Minister talked about costs. I know from page 36 of the regulatory impact assessment that the Government have undertaken to pay &#163;369 million of the &#163;389 million that will arise from the policy costs of statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance. If my maths serve me correctly, that is 94.85 per cent. of the total cost. We learned in the debate that the costs &nbsp; could rise or fall. If they fall, that would be to the benefit of the Government and of business. If they rise, there could be a pinch point. Are the Government committed to maintaining 94.85 per cent. of the cost, if the costs rise or fall?</p>

<p> Yes, that is the approach that we are adopting.</p>
<p>I have obtained a little more information about the issue of direct payments, which was raised earlier. Building on the work done by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs&rsquo; ad hoc consultation group on direct payment, the Government carried out a further analysis that demonstrated that such a scheme would represent neither good value for money for the taxpayer nor a significant saving for employers. It would provide about &#163;1.1 million of savings for employers, of which only about &#163;400,000 would accrue to small employers. The costs of implementing such a scheme are estimated at up to &#163;75 million in set-up costs and &#163;50 million per year in ongoing costs. It has been deemed that that would not be a good use of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>

<p> In one sense, I am delighted to help; a full analysis can be found in a technical note on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs&rsquo; website, at&mdash;and this is the sense in which I am not delighted, because reading out website addresses is rarely easy; however, I will ensure that it is correct in Hansard&mdash;www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2005/smp.pdf.</p>
<p>Finally&mdash;I am determined to get to the end&mdash;the amendments would add more complexity, and would have the opposite effect to that which the Government want; we want to give parents the choice of staying at home for longer, and of looking after their child themselves during the first year of the child&rsquo;s life. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for North Norfolk will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.5.50" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" time="11:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s02.htm" colnum="18">
<p> The amendment was a genuine attempt to initiate a debate on how we can introduce greater flexibility and put greater power in the hands of the woman taking maternity leave, the father taking paternity leave, or either parent in respect of adoption leave. I fully acknowledge the flaws in the wording of the amendment. Earlier, the hon. Member for Tooting highlighted the risk of a windfall being paid in circumstances in which someone chooses to go back to work very early, so the amendment is not the finished product, and I readily accept that.</p>
<p>However, we ought to be looking into how we can ensure that the rights provided in the Bill are actually taken up. That is what I am interested in, and I think that that is what Government Members are interested in, too. The regulatory impact assessment identifies that as few as 9,000 fathers will take up the paternity leave right. As for maternity leave, on page 29 of the &nbsp; RIA, the assumption is that 8 per cent. of mothers who currently take 26 weeks will move to 39 weeks, so we are talking about a low proportion of mothers, too. I fully accept what the Minister says: in part, that is a cultural thing. It is a matter of changing attitudes.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why fathers, in particular, will not take advantage of the entitlement has nothing to do with money, but the Government must concede that it has something to do with money. Part of the reason why fathers will not take up the full entitlement is because they feel that they cannot afford to do so at the rate of &#163;106 per week.</p>

<p> Is there not a deep prejudice underlying what the hon. Gentleman just said&mdash;the idea that men earn far more than women? Is not that exactly the type of thing that we are trying to do something about? Changing the culture, in the way that we have proposed, will actually help.</p>

<p> What I said was absolutely not about prejudice; it was an acknowledgment of the reality. The hon. Lady will know that there is a pay gap. We have unequal pay in this country. The Equal Opportunities Commission works tirelessly to try and remove that gap, but it exists. If we are serious in our aim, which I am sure we share, of getting fathers to take up paternity leave we must ensure that it is more than gesture politics. There is a real risk of coming out with a grand statement on the introduction of paternity leave when, quietly hidden away on page 85 of the RIA, it acknowledges that a tiny percentage of fathers will take it up&mdash;partly because of the pay. It will not actually mean much then.</p>

<p> I am sure it is not hidden, as the hon. Gentleman has managed to find it. The estimate is on the basis of evidence from the maternity and paternity rights survey 2005. It is not a number picked from the air. The Government have to deal with reality, something with which I know that the Liberal Democrats have a problem. The hon. Gentleman needs to acknowledge that even in Sweden, where pay levels are higher, take-up by fathers is still low. It is, as much as anything, a cultural issue.</p>

<p> I apologise for intervening again, but I am grateful for the opportunity. I believe that one reason why men are paid more is that in later life they have not taken paternity time off if they want it earlier. As I think I said at Second Reading, what tends to &nbsp; happen is that because the rights accrue to the woman and she spends more time at home, the man works harder. So the man, after a few years, ends up getting paid more. For people starting out, then, the purpose of the Bill is to prevent that happening if they do not want it. Therefore the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s comments about it being the pay at the point when a young family sets off do not actually apply.</p>

<p> I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. I accept her point, and that the Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to address that problem. However, if the Government assume that only 9,000 fathers will take paternity leave, it will not do much to address that problem. So I want to find a way of facilitating fathers taking time off in practice, not just in terms of gestures. I am sure that the hon. Lady would agree that if the consequence of my amendment was that more fathers took perhaps eight weeks off&mdash;rather than no time at all&mdash;it must be a good thing. Surely it is good to find ways to encourage fathers to take an element of their entitlement, rather than nothing. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve.</p>
<p>To deal with another point, the hon. Member for Tooting raised the suggestion, in an intervention on the Conservative spokesman, that the amendment somehow sought to undermine the rights of low-paid people to take the full period. It does not, because the power is put completely into the hands of the mother or father. If either wants to take the full period, at the rate of &#163;106 per week, that is their entitlement. I would be delighted if people did that, but it is simply an acknowledgment of economic reality that many people will not. The RIA accepts that, and I am seeking ways to ensure that people take advantage of the good entitlement that the Bill provides.</p>
<p>In summary, my amendment was a probing one in a group of amendments. I do not seek to press it to a vote, because it is currently incomplete, but I hope that the Government will do some further thinking on ways to increase flexibility. On the point about complexity for employers, it seems rather simple to me; if every employer knows that the entitlement is the full amount of statutory maternity, statutory adoption or statutory paternity pay, it is not really a complicated matter. Everyone would get to know the full entitlement for every employee taking time off. I do not see that that is any great complication for an employer to have to deal with. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p> Clause 1 extends the maximum period for the payment of statutory maternity pay that may be prescribed in regulations from 26 weeks to 52 weeks.

<p> Is the Minister in a position to give us some information on the phasing of that? Clarity is crucial and employers will want to know what they are planning for. The Minister has referred to the end of the Parliament; that could be four or five years away depending on events in Government and within the ministerial ranks. I wonder whether she could give employers the opportunity to understand what she expects. If she cannot, when will employers know when 39 weeks will become 52?

<p> Thank you. Well, there we go.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman needs to take heart from the process with which we are involved at the moment. We are starting the process and giving employers notice that we will introduce the provision of 39 weeks on 1 April 2007. We want to assess how that goes and to remain in consultation. As I have said, employers know that our aim is 52 weeks by the end of the Parliament, but we will continue to consult and will give sufficient notice in line with the better regulation principles to which we adhere.</p>
<p>As I was about to say, this is an important change for working mothers and is part of our continuing drive to help pregnant working women and parents achieve a better balance in their home and working lives. An extra 13 weeks paid maternity leave will be worth nearly &#163;1,400 to the majority of women. We set out our commitment to extend maternity pay in our consultation document &ldquo;Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility.&rdquo; The document was well received, with all sides recognising that any extra time that the mother has at home with her baby will be beneficial to the child but will also allow the mother greater opportunity to secure child care arrangements and to smooth her path to return to work. That will also be beneficial to her employer.</p>
<p>We recognise that some employers, and particularly small employers, are concerned that the absence of an employee over a long period can cause difficulties. We believe, however, that the increased availability of paid leave will make it easier for women to return to work and stay at work because they will have the opportunity to take the amount of paid maternity leave that they feel they need. Businesses will benefit because they will retain the skills and services of employees that they might otherwise lose, avoiding recruitment and training costs. We will, however, ensure that the views of employers are taken into account and that the impact of these important changes is fully understood and considered before any further extension of the pay period to 52 weeks is implemented.</p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister and I welcome her point about consultation. Will she undertake to ensure that she and her colleagues meet with all the small business organisations prior to the &nbsp; bringing forward of any draft regulations, so that they will have an opportunity to contribute to those deliberations?</p>

<p> Of course. There is regular consultation with such organisations not only on this matter but on other issues.</p>
<p>Of course, there are costs in the short term, both in paying statutory maternity pay and in arranging cover for absent employees, but those costs should be seen in context as an investment in the future for the employer. The taxpayer, through the Revenue, reimburses large employers 92 per cent. of the statutory maternity pay that they pay out and small employers get back all of the statutory maternity pay that they pay out plus an additional payment of 4.5 per cent. to meet their national insurance costs. We widened the definition of small employer in April 2004. Now, 60 per cent. of employers who pay statutory maternity pay in any year get back 104.5 per cent. of the statutory maternity pay paid out. In this Bill, we are making it easier for employers to operate statutory maternity pay. We will address that in more detail when we discuss the relevant schedule. We are amending the start date of the maternity pay period to align it with the start of maternity leave. In addition, we are making it possible for statutory maternity pay to be paid at a daily rate, to make it easier for employers to align SMP payments with their employees&rsquo; usual pay period.</p>
<p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs is introducing an extensive package of support for employers; I referred to that earlier, and I am happy to give more detail to the hon. Gentleman now. The aim is to eliminate manual SMP calculation, and to make the assessment process easier to understand. For example, the electronic calculators that are already available are being improved, as is guidance, and plans are being worked on to help employers calculate SMP over the telephone via their employer helpline service. The telephone conversation will then be followed up with a written confirmation of the SMP calculation to the employer, thereby considerably easing employers&rsquo; concerns over the calculation.</p>
<p>This measure will benefit more than 390,000 women a year&mdash;about 317,000 who receive SMP, and a further 76,000 who receive maternity allowance. The payment period for maternity allowance is dependent on that for SMP, so the maximum maternity allowance period will also automatically be extended to 52 weeks as a result of this clause. Some 20,000 women a year who receive maternity allowance have not been employed long enough to qualify for additional maternity leave. They will therefore not have the right to take time off work and benefit from the proposed extra 13 weeks of maternity allowance. We are extending the eligibility condition attached to additional maternity leave so that all women who currently get ordinary maternity leave will get additional maternity leave and will be able to take the extra pay.</p>
<p>I shall now deal with how the clause works. It amends the regulation-making power in section 165(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to allow the maternity pay period to be a maximum of 52 weeks. The length of the maternity allowance period automatically follows by virtue of section 35(2) of that Act, which provides that the maternity allowance period will be the same as the maternity pay period. The extension of the maternity pay period&mdash;and, in consequence, the maternity allowance period&mdash;to 39 weeks will be specified in regulations. The extension of the maternity pay period forms a crucial part of a broad package of measures that will help parents choose how best to combine parenthood with their responsibilities towards their employer.</p>

<p> Clause 2 extends the maximum period for the payment of statutory adoption pay that may be prescribed in regulations from 26 weeks to 52 weeks; 52 weeks is the goal that we aim to achieve by the end of this Parliament. As a first step, we will increase the period of payment to 39 weeks for adoptions where the child is placed for adoption on or after 1 April 2007. That is an important change for prospective adoptive parents who are working, and it is part of our continuing drive to help working parents achieve a better balance between their home and working lives, while ensuring that adopters continue broadly to benefit from the same entitlements as birth mothers. An extra 13 weeks&rsquo; statutory adoption pay will be worth nearly &#163;1,400 in the majority of cases.</p>
<p>We set out our commitment to extend adoption pay, mirroring the extensions to maternity pay and maternity allowance, in our consultation document, &ldquo;Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility&rdquo;. That document was well received, with all sides recognising that any extra time that the adopter has at home with his or her child will allow them greater opportunity to settle the child into their new family, to make any child care arrangements, and to ensure that they can return to work having taken the appropriate steps for their family. Adopters do an important job for society, and ensuring that they can return to work successfully is beneficial for them and their employers.</p>
<p>We recognise that some employers, particularly small employers, are concerned about the absence of an employee over a long period. However, the increased availability of paid leave will make it easier for adopters to return to work after the end of their leave, because they are more likely to have had the opportunity to take the amount of paid maternity &nbsp; leave that they feel they need to meet their needs and deal with the issues relating to the child or children who they are adopting.</p>
<p>Businesses will benefit because they will retain the skills and services of the employee whom they might otherwise lose, thus avoiding any new or further recruitment and training costs. We will ensure that the views of employers are taken into account and that the impact of these important changes are fully understood and considered before any further extension of the pay period to 52 weeks is implemented.</p>
<p>There are costs in the short term, both in paying statutory adoption pay and in arranging cover for absent employees, but those should be seen as an investment in the future. The taxpayer, through the Revenue, reimburses larger employers 92 per cent. of the statutory adoption pay and small employers get back all the statutory adoption pay plus an additional payment of 4.5 per cent. to meet their national insurance costs.</p>
<p>We have widened the definition of a small employer in April 2004, so more employers benefit. The Bill also makes it easier for employers to manage and administer statutory adoption pay. We are making it possible for statutory adoption pay to be paid at a daily rate, to make it easier for employers to align those payments with their employees&rsquo; usual pay period. That measure will benefit more than 4,000 adopters per year.</p>
<p>Clause 2 amends the regulation-making power in section 171ZN(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to allow the adoption pay period to be a maximum of 52 weeks. The extension of the adoption pay period to 39 weeks will be specified in regulations.</p>
<p>The extension to the adoption pay period forms a crucial part of a range of measures that will help parents choose how best to combine parenthood with their responsibilities towards their employer.</p>

<p> Will the Minister just confirm, as she did generously on the previous clause, that all the small business representatives will have the opportunity to look at the draft regulations? We do not have that chance, but it is important that they should do so and have a chance to contribute to the regulations before they are brought to the House.</p>

<p> Once again, I concur with the hon. Gentleman. It is good to see the Minister bringing forward this provision, because encouraging people to adopt is crucial. There are so many children who need &nbsp; to be adopted and given a second chance in life due to the circumstances in which they were born and lived their early lives.</p>
<p>It is incredible to think that we have not previously treated adoptive parents in the same way as birth parents. We support the clause.</p>

<p> It is an honour to move my first amendment under your chairmanship, Mr. Bayley.</p>
<p>This is a probing amendment to elicit a little more elucidation from my hon. Friends on the Front Bench as to their intention when laying down regulations determining the precise nature of mainly fathers&rsquo; ability to take paternity rights.</p>
<p>In the pre-Budget report a year ago, the Chancellor said that the Government would allow mothers to transfer part of their leave to fathers. That was all that was said at that point. The impression was given that it would be quite a flexible arrangement so that at any point in the maternity leave if both parents wanted it the leave could be transferred to the father, who could take over the responsibility for the young child. Since then the Government have consulted on their &nbsp; proposal. Although no decision has yet been made and I understand that none will be made during the passage of the Bill, some remarks have been made that suggest that Ministers are moving towards a situation where they would prefer the woman to take the first six months and the man to take any entitlement that remains, up to an additional six months.</p>
<p>My amendment would return us to the spirit of the original announcement so that it would be entirely flexible. If a woman wished to return to work before six months, the father would take up the leave if he wanted to at that point. This is important because otherwise, if both parents wished to swap over, it would be denied to them. That could be a problem where the woman wanted to go back to work because it was important to her identity and happiness or where it was financially sensible for her to do so. Although the majority of cases may not be like this, as was emphasised in our earlier debate, she may earn more and it may be in the financial interests of the family, and therefore the child, for her to return earlier if she wants to. The mother may be in such a position in her organisation&mdash;perhaps a small business or even a large corporation&mdash;that she wants to return early for fear of what might happen to that organisation if she does not continue to be at the helm.</p>
<p>I must declare a small interest here, as a female Member of Parliament with a small child. I wished to return to work and my constituents wished me to do so, but under the current legislation my husband had to resign his job in order to take over the care of our child. If we do not accept the spirit of this amendment in regulations, we shall be in an anomalous situation where parents would have to introduce an alternative form of child care for the period from three to six months, which would seem unnecessarily disruptive if a father wished to take over. Alternatively, the Government would make it more likely that a small business with a mother at the helm would fail, which is not what we are attempting to do. The mother would be forced to remain at home until her husband was able to take over.</p>
<p>I understand that there has been considerable consultation on this. I should like to give my response on what I think some of the issues are. Obviously, Department of Health guidelines and World Health Organisation guidelines state that women should be encouraged to breastfeed for the first six months. However, it is not law that they should do so. If that is what we intend, we should legislate for it. The Department of Health makes all sorts of other recommendations about eating five portions of fruit and veg each day, not smoking, not drinking too much and so on. Ultimately it is a matter of choice. It is also technically possible to return to work and breastfeed through expressing milk. It is tedious, but it is possible. Indeed, in other parts of the statute book we make it easier for mothers to do that through the legal requirement on employers to provide places where they can express milk and so on.</p>
<p>I understand that businesses may find it complex to have to keep track of what the mother is doing when a father asks to exercise his paternal rights. However, &nbsp; that would also be the case if they decided to do it at month 7 or month 8, which is what the Government seem to be suggesting at the moment. I do not see how it is more complex to do it at month 4 than at month 7. A large number of the consultees did not favour it. However, some did. Those who did represent an enormous interest group&mdash;fathers, through Fathers Direct. My question to my hon. Friends is whether the responses to the consultation are representative of the type of people who need the spirit of the amendment to be reflected in regulations. I never thought that I would say this, but I have tabled the amendment because I believe that the provision discriminates against men, and I am all in favour of equality.</p>

<p> I am sure that the hon. Lady will not want me to say it, but the amendment seems to be intended to introduce the same sort of flexibility that I was aiming for in my amendments. I support her aim of eliciting elucidation, as I think she put it. There should be flexibility for mothers and fathers to make the relevant judgments themselves, rather than having a straitjacket placed on them. Despite the pay gap that, as I pointed out, sadly still exists, there are, none the less, many households where the woman earns more money, or is in a more responsible and more onerous job than the father. There may be many circumstances in which it suits that household for the woman to return early to work and hand over to the father.</p>
<p>The Bill seems to introduce a real block by requiring that if the woman of a household has very good personal reasons for wanting to return to work after, say, three months, a period of another three months would have to intervene in which another carer would look after the child, before the father could take his entitlement to paternity leave. I am sure that the Government would want to avoid that consequence. It does not seem a good approach to the care of the child to have the mother caring for him or her for three months, a carer for the second three months, and the father thereafter. We should all try to avoid that outcome.</p>
<p>I should have thought that, given that the sharing of maternity and paternity leave&mdash;the substitution that the Bill provides for&mdash;introduces a complexity that employers will have to deal with at some stage in any case, it would make no difference if they had to deal with that task after three months rather than after seven or eight, or whatever period would need to be clocked up under the Bill and the expected regulations. As the hon. Lady said, the signs are that the regulations would provide for the right to paternity leave only after six months.</p>
<p>The Bill should provide the flexibility to facilitate matters for those households in which, for good reasons, the choice is made for the mother to return to work earlier and the father to take over. At the moment, the impression we get from the Government is that that flexibility would be blocked.</p>

<p> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) for tabling the amendment and speaking to it so eloquently. It raises an important issue about the way in which the Bill is designed to operate. It comes back again to flexibility, choice and the fact that each family is different. The hon. Lady herself is a good example of what I am talking about, and having been in a similar position I have every sympathy with her. As Members of Parliament, we are fortunate; although we work very long hours in comparison with the average, we have a bit of flexibility in how we arrange our days and weeks. In our job, it is possible to give birth to a baby, look after it and continue working. I was amazed to find that that was possible. I am sure that the hon. Lady has much more confidence than I, but somehow or other I have managed to muddle my way through and I now have a happy, healthy four-year-old.</p>
<p>I am sure that the hon. Lady will agree that flexibility and choice are vital. As she was explaining why she tabled her amendment and the possibilities that could arise, something occurred to me: what if the mother of a new baby became ill? That is not unusual. Last week, I had a meeting with the Epping Forest mental health trust and we discussed where its resources should be used and so on. I discovered that the incidence of post-natal depression is much higher than anyone imagines.</p>
<p>I am sure that we can all think of cases in which, for some reason or other, mothers simply cannot look after their babies and need help. In such cases, the natural next person to look after the child is its father, so the Bill should make provision for a father to begin looking after a child as soon as it is born. Perhaps the mother will not have gone back to work, but is ill and unable to look after her child&mdash;I use post-natal depression only as an example; there are all sorts of ways in which that could happen. That the father is not able to take paternity leave immediately, should that be necessary, simply does not make sense. The hon. Lady&rsquo;s amendment and the others in this group are therefore worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>I am sure that the Minister will consider the points made in the spirit in which they are meant. In my case, I want to improve the Bill, not change the intention behind it or increase costs and complicate matters for employers, especially small employers. I simply want to give flexibility and choice, so that any family can respond at any time to the circumstances in which it finds itself.</p>

<p> I appreciate your forbearance, Mr. Bayley. I should acknowledge that the Minister with responsibility for employment relations, consumers and fair markets, who is a good friend, pointed out from a sedentary position that I had not spoken to my amendments in this group. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly to them.</p>
<p>The group of amendments deals with keeping-in-touch days, which are a good part of the Bill. The concept is that during a period of ordinary or additional maternity leave, of the different types of adoption leave or of additional paternity leave, it is perfectly appropriate for an employee to go into work &nbsp; on an agreed basis for a certain number of days to keep in touch with and perhaps liaise with their replacement employee and so forth.</p>
<p>However, there is a concern, expressed by Citizens Advice, that unscrupulous employers might seek to put too much pressure on employees to come back for too many days. The purpose of this group of amendments, which covers all the different sorts of leave in the Bill, is to set a framework within which the discussion between employer and employee can take place, and to limit the number of keeping-in-touch days provided for in the regulations. Within that maximum number, the employer and the employee can negotiate without any risk of the employer seeking to exploit the opportunity to force the employee to work too much during the period of leave. We again seek to set a framework within which the two sides can negotiate a reasonable arrangement. The proposal in no way seeks to undermine the good concept of introducing the right to have keeping-in-touch days.</p>

<p> I speak in support of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley, which supports flexibility. Each family should be able to work out what is best for it. It is important that we have flexibility.</p>
<p>I want to make a few points about breastfeeding. My hon. Friend covered the issues that arise with the recommendation that women should breastfeed for six months. I want to use the opportunity to say how difficult it often is for women to breastfeed for six months, even if they do not go back to work. That partly results from the culture of the society in which we live. It is important that we do all we can to support workplace conditions that will encourage and enable breastfeeding.</p>
<p>I was involved in a campaign to improve conditions in this place some years ago. As a result of that, we have some rooms where MPs, other members of staff and the public can go to breastfeed in the Parliament building. However, that is far from adequate in terms of the culture that we would like. In strongly welcoming my hon. Friend&rsquo;s amendment, I want to make the point that there is an issue to address on breastfeeding, whether women return to work after three months or six months.</p>

<p> Good morning, Mr. Bayley. I listened with interest to the high-quality debates on the previous clauses and amendments. I welcome you to the Chair and thank you for chairing our discussions. If you will allow me, I will set out the context for the amendments and the clause.</p>
<p>A great deal of discussion has taken place, as my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for women and equality mentioned, about the balance that needs to be struck between the needs of the employees, the needs of the employer and the overall position of the labour market strategy.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for North Norfolk talked about a revolution that had taken place. I agree with him, but it had starting points in many of the acts of this &nbsp; Government in 1997. The British social attitudes survey 2004 has been launched, and it shows people&rsquo;s attitudes to work and the working environment. In 1994, nearly half&mdash;47 per cent.&mdash;of employees worked flexibly; in 2004, that had increased to 57 per cent. That is a tremendous increase, which also shows the cultural change that we are trying to address in terms of people&rsquo;s attitudes to work. That is important because of the demography of the country, the competitive situation that most of our companies are in and the need for them to treat their employees in a proper manner.</p>
<p>I can remember my experience of being a factory worker. I went to start my shift one day having had problems with child care provision, and I arrived at work late. The supervisor said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what happens anywhere outside the workplace, your job is to be in here for eight hours and to work for those eight hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That attitude is what needs to change. The way the Government have gone about that since 1997 is to try to get a consensus about how we deal with it. It is no good the Government coming forward with a long list of aspirations that are meaningless to people in a workplace situation, be that employer or employee. I hope that that sets the context for the remarks that I will made about the amendments.</p>

<p> Without wishing to test people&rsquo;s patience too far, I appreciate that the Minister&rsquo;s comments were contextual but does he accept&mdash;I am sure he will&mdash;that the instance to which he referred was an exception? In other words, the vast majority of employers are keen and willing to ensure that if they can accommodate their staff&rsquo;s family concerns, they do so.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.9.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" time="12:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s04.htm" colnum="30">
<p> I am indeed prepared to do that, and the success of the introduction in 2003 of the right to request flexible working has shown that 90 per cent. of requests are met. However, I gave that example to illustrate the historical way in which some people&mdash;not necessarily employers but middle management&mdash;addressed some of those issues. We may return to the question of middle managers later in our discussions.</p>
<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley on her first amendment. She said that it was a probing amendment, so I hope that she is not defeated on it and will accept the Minister&rsquo;s wisdom in his response to it. I hope that that will not test her patience too far. I know that she has played a considerable part in the fashioning of the Bill in her previous roles outside Parliament, and I congratulate her on that. I shall also be grateful if the hon. Member for North Norfolk remembers to move his amendment, or he will make a large part of my speech redundant.</p>

<p> Self-interest, or rather the power of friendship.</p>
<p>Turning to amendments Nos. 17 and 23, one of the options in the 2003 Green Paper, &ldquo;Work and Parents: Competitiveness and Choice&rdquo; was that the second six &nbsp; months of a woman&rsquo;s maternity leave could be taken by a father. At that time, the proposal did not receive as much support as other options, so was not pursued. My hon. Friend the Member for Burnley said that whether the leave could be shared was considered. When we looked at extending maternity pay, we returned to the idea, as we felt that its time had come. The consultation paper, &ldquo;Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility&rdquo;, published in February this year, asked when the earliest point should be for a mother to transfer her leave and pay entitlement to the father. We were open minded about the start date, so we consulted on the three options: six weeks, three months, and six months. The overwhelming majority of those who responded said that the first six months of the mother&rsquo;s maternity leave period should be reserved for the mother.</p>
<p>I shall quote one of the many responses that we received on that point:</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&ldquo;We recommend the implementation of option 2 (transfer of leave and pay after six months following the start of maternity leave) because paid maternity leave was extended to six months just two years ago, and needs time to bed in for employers and employees. However, the Equal Opportunities Commission proposes that the option to transfer maternity leave before six months could be reviewed at a future date, in the light of experience of managing shared parental leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CBI members believe that</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&ldquo;mothers should be able to transfer a proportion of their leave and pay six months after her maternity leave has started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As hon. Members are aware, since publishing the consultation document in February 2005, the Government have decided to offer a period of additional paternity leave to fathers, rather than transferring maternity leave. However, the question about the earliest date at which the father can start his leave remains the same. If women were able to return to work at any point in their maternity leave period, allowing fathers to take up additional paternity leave at any time could lead to women feeling under pressure to return at an earlier point than they may actually wish. That may give rise to health issues and undermine the women&rsquo;s ability to continue to breastfeed if she so wished.</p>
<p>I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), about the guidance of the World Health Organisation on that&mdash;although it is guidance, not law. I refrain from getting involved in further discussion on that issue, to the extent that that advice and the need to consider six months was important to us.</p>
<p>Introducing the possibility of mothers returning to work at an earlier point to allow for fathers to take additional paternity leave could mean a greater risk of women changing their minds, which would cause disruption to her employer and possibly the father&rsquo;s employer. There would be a risk that if her early return to employment did not work, she may leave the employment and possibly be absent from the work force for a longer period of time. We think that the risk of that happening is greater if the woman returns after &nbsp; a short period of leave. Business has raised concerns about uncertainty attached to maternity leave, and the disruption caused by losing a valuable member of staff.</p>

<p> One of the contributions to the consultation exercise that the Minister referred to indicated support for a six-month period but also said that the Government should consider greater flexibility later on in the light of experience. Is that what they intend to do?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.9.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" time="12:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s04.htm" colnum="32">
<p> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. As I said in the contextual part of my speech, the Government have tried to set the agenda&mdash;to prove that something works and then move on, or to reflect about the success of a particular aspect. Yes, it would always be our position to reflect on how something is working. The EOC submission was that the provision has been in place for only a short time, and that we should let it bed in and consider it later. We are happy to do that; that is how successful policy is developed.</p>
<p>In our conversations with business groups on the question of fixing the earliest point at which additional paternity leave can be taken, it was recognised that there could be increased pressure on business to provide occupational top-up pay to fathers, as many businesses already offer occupational top-ups to mothers on maternity leave in the first six months. Business groups felt that if the father took additional paternity leave in the second six months, that pressure would be somewhat dissipated. If the start point for taking additional paternity leave was not fixed, the pressure placed on the mother to return to work if the father had enhanced occupational top-ups would also be greater. We wish to avoid pressuring the mother to return to work.</p>
<p>We have listened to the comments received in response to the consultation, and we include in subsection (5)(a) of proposed section 80AA to the Employment Rights Act 1996 the power to allow us to fix a point from which the additional paternity leave can be taken. The intention is to reserve the first six months of a mother&rsquo;s maternity leave. We intend that point to be prescribed in regulations, and we suggest in our consultation on the detail of the scheme that we are due to launch in the new year that it should be 20 weeks from the birth of the child. That reflects the fact that the average mother begins maternity leave six weeks before the birth; the provision would provide the closest proxy to reserving the first six months of a mother&rsquo;s maternity leave.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Epping Forest spoke about the need for about flexibility in exceptional circumstances, but she will be aware that there already exists two weeks paternity leave, with the opportunity for a further four weeks of unpaid leave. The father also has the right to request flexible working. Other legislative provisions support exceptional circumstances.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.9.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" time="12:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s04.htm" colnum="32">
<p> Does the Minister acknowledge that the two weeks statutory paternity leave have to be taken in the first eight weeks after the birth? There is not much flexibility in the first six months.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.9.16" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" time="12:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s04.htm" colnum="32">
<p> I recognise that, but I refer again to what I said about balance and getting employers and employees on side. There are provisions for exceptional circumstances in the first two weeks, and there are opportunities for additional leave. We are talking about the minimum standards to be laid down in legislation.</p>
<p>I spoke of the survey showing that attitudes are changing. Many businesses see the business case for looking after their employees. They are developing positive policies that are way in excess of the statutory provisions being laid down by the Government. That is to be welcomed. In the context of the labour market strategy, the Government are concerned about discrimination against women, and particularly against those of child-bearing years. It is illegal, but we know that it happens, and we must try to ensure that all businesses understand the worth that women can contribute to their work force. Indeed, many good employers already see that.</p>

<p> I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s remarks. What lessons does he take from the situation in Sweden, where women are finding that oppressive and restrictive legislation has made them less desirable as employees? They therefore seek more flexibility. That may mirror some of the points to which the amendment refers.</p>

<p> There is good and bad in each member state&rsquo;s employment legislation. We want Europe to pick the best legislation that supports the development and growth of jobs and that helps social protection and welfare. There is a balance to be struck. Labour market flexibility and the demographic changes faced by the UK are important, and businesses need to know that they have to attract good employees. Women can and do play an important part in our economic life. It is important that employers realise that, and they must understand that they need to support and develop the aspirations of women not only in the working environment but in the family environment.</p>
<p>I turn to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North Norfolk. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, as they give us the opportunity to discuss the introduction of keeping-in-touch stays and, in particular, the principle that the number of such days should be limited. The Government&rsquo;s working families consultation considered how we could enable good communication to take place between women and employers during maternity leave.</p>
<p>Following the consultation, we have committed to clarifying in law the principle that the employer will be able to make reasonable contact with the woman during her maternity leave. The reasonable contact provisions will be set out in regulations, on which we will consult in the new year. The Bill also provides enabling powers for us to introduce keeping-in-touch days. Keeping-in-touch days will enable women to carry out some work activity during their maternity leave without bringing it to an end. The same principles apply to adoption leave and to additional paternity leave. An adopter may take up to one year&rsquo;s leave when a child is placed with them, so the same &nbsp; difficulties with regard to employers and employees losing touch could apply. The Bill allows us to provide that a father may take up to six months&rsquo; additional paternity leave and that, in the unfortunate circumstances in which a child&rsquo;s mother dies, he may take up to one year&rsquo;s additional paternity leave. Therefore, working mothers, fathers and adopters and their employers will all benefit from the introduction of keeping-in-touch days.</p>
<p>We will consult on the detail of the scheme when we publish regulations in the new year. Parallel provisions will ensure that an employee does not lose any statutory maternity, adoption or additional paternity pay or maternity allowance by taking advantage of keeping-in-touch days. Keeping-in-touch days will help working parents and employers to stay in touch during maternity, adoption and additional paternity leave, and will enable employees to carry out some work activity. That might be actual work&mdash;whatever the employee would have been doing had he or she been working as usual rather than being on leave&mdash;or an opportunity to go into work for activities such as appraisals and team meetings.</p>
<p>Enabling that contact to take place will strengthen links between working parents and employers during maternity, adoption or additional paternity leave, and will help parents to keep up with developments at work and update their skills. We expect that that will ease the transition back to work after leave, enabling parents to get back up to speed more quickly after their absence. Such a provision should ease any concern that employers and fathers might have about what impact the new right to additional paternity leave will have on them.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s amendments would set out in the Bill a requirement to specify the number of keeping-in-touch days that would apply during ordinary and additional maternity leave, ordinary and additional adoption leave and additional paternity leave. Our intention has always been that the number of keeping-in-touch days should be limited. Keeping-in-touch days are intended to enable employees and employers to keep in touch. We do not intend them to facilitate a kind of part-time leave so, by their nature, they must be limited. Therefore, although I welcome the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s amendments&mdash;they show that we are in agreement on the matter&mdash;and am grateful that we agree in principle, I do not believe that the amendments are necessary. The Bill provides powers for us to specify the circumstances in which an employee may work for an employer during maternity, adoption or additional paternity leave. That is sufficient to enable us to limit the number of days on which an employee may work. Accordingly, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.</p>

<p> In terms of the hon. Lady&rsquo;s amendment, the Minister indicated in response to an intervention from me that he was willing to consider the matter again. I certainly welcome that; it seems sensible to adopt an incremental approach. So far as my amendments are concerned, I am pleased that the Government accept them in principle, and am not entirely surprised that he has decided that they are unnecessary. We will have to trust the Government to implement them by way of regulations when the time comes. The important principle is that a framework should be set within which keeping-in-touch days will operate.</p>
<p>I should say that, from my experience in my previous life as an employment law solicitor, there has always been a great fear on the part of employers that any contact with the employee during a period of maternity leave will get employers into trouble, and that it is not appropriate to talk to the woman on maternity leave. That is crazy; it is not in the woman&rsquo;s or the employer&rsquo;s interests. There ought to be reasonable contact. The concept of keeping-in-touch days enshrines that principle. It is perfectly sensible for the employee to return to work for a defined and limited number of days to maintain that contact, something that I am sure many employees would very much welcome. As the Minister said, that would help to facilitate, in due course, the return to work.</p>

<p> I will keep my remarks brief, and deal with all the amendments in my name together. In my opening remarks&mdash;when you correctly stopped me developing this point, Mr. Bayley&mdash;I sought to make a point raised by the TUC in its commentary on the Bill. It said that the Bill leaves an awful lot to regulations. There are dangers in that. If one were to read the Bill as it stands without any explanatory notes, one would be left largely in the dark about an awful lot of the details of what will finally emerge by way of regulations. Also, that approach leaves open the question of when the regulations will be tabled for consideration, and what the time scale for the introduction of those rights will be. I stick by the principle that, by and large, it is better for more to be on the face of the Bill, so that there can be proper democratic debate on it.</p>

<p> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, and I shall have more time to go through it in detail in my response, but if we put everything in the Bill, that cuts out the flexibility for negotiations and consultation. Surely the aim is to get our principles and objectives&mdash;what we are trying to achieve&mdash;in the Bill, and then to use the regulations for further consultation?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.9.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" time="12:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s04.htm" colnum="37">
<p> I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention, and I take that point, to some degree. None the less, it is possible to have consultation before the Bill is presented to Parliament; indeed, there has &nbsp; been some. I acknowledge that there is always a balance to be struck. Any Government will use the mechanism of regulation to fill in the details, and I accept that there is a place for that; it is a question of degree. My feeling is that the Bill goes a bit too far in the direction of relying on regulations to implement the detail of the provisions. However, that is the way that things have been done, and I accept that.</p>
<p>At the very least, it ought to be possible for Parliament to debate those regulations&mdash;the culmination, as the Minister says, of that further consultation process&mdash;once they have been prepared. If the process is simply one of consultation followed by statutory instruments being introduced without opportunity for debate in Parliament, that would be a bad thing. As a package, the amendments propose the affirmative process in relation to the set of clauses that provide for regulations to be introduced to flesh out the objectives of the clauses.</p>

<p> I agree with the hon. Gentleman once again. I am sure that we will find something on which we can heartily disagree when we come to the next part of the Bill.</p>
<p>I am concerned about amendments. Again and again in recent weeks the Government have presented Bills that have gone into Committee only eight days after Second Reading, so that only one weekend elapses, whereas until recently the convention generally followed by every Government was that there should be two clear weekends between Second Reading and Committee. That gave everyone concerned the time properly to examine the Bill, consult outside bodies and table amendments, and it gave time for the Government to produce the regulations on which the measure would depend. On Second Reading I made that point, and so did my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff), who asked the Secretary of State whether he intended to make the draft regulations available to the Committee before it finished its work. The Secretary of State said:</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&ldquo;We can try. The timetable is a little tight, but I hope that we can publish those regulations before the Committee rises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is entirely within the Government&rsquo;s power to change the timetable. There is no reason why we should be considering the Bill in Committee today rather than next Tuesday or as soon as we come back after the Christmas recess in January. We all welcome the Bill and want it to be made law as soon as possible, but it is not an emergency Bill. It does not make very much difference whether it becomes law in spring or early summer. A few weeks do not matter, but what matters for the proper working of the democratic process is that Members of this House and, indeed, another place, should be able properly to consider what the Government intend to do.</p>
<p>Once again, as with other Bills in recent weeks, the regulations have not been published. We are asked this morning to consider clauses 3 to 10, all of which are dependent on regulations, but we do not even have an undertaking from the Government that those regulations will come before the House by the affirmative rather than the negative procedure. It is quite improper that we should reach this point in the Bill&rsquo;s consideration without knowing what the Government intend. What do they have to hide by not producing the regulations? We are all in favour of the intent of the Bill, but it is our duty, as representatives of our constituents, to hold the Government to account for the exact provisions that they propose to implement. We cannot do that because we do not know what they are. Much of our debate this morning would have been much better informed&mdash;and it still would be, in the remainder of the Bill&rsquo;s time in Committee&mdash;if we had the regulations.</p>
<p>It is hard to understand how the Secretary of State could seriously say,</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&ldquo;We can try. The timetable is a little tight&rdquo;,</p>
<p>adding</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&ldquo;but I hope that we can publish those regulations before the Committee rises. That is probably a heroic ambition, but I hope that we can publish the regulations while the Bill completes its remaining stages and certainly by the time that it returns from the Lords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also quite improper that we should expect our colleagues in another place to give consideration to the detail of a Bill when Members of this House cannot do so. I am a strong supporter of the work done by the second Chamber, but it is supposed to be a revising Chamber. How can it revise when we have not first considered the matters that it will be expected to deal with?</p>
<p>It is impossible to understand how the Secretary of State can stand up in the House with a straight face and say that he would like the Committee to agree in principle to regulations that the Government have not yet brought forward&mdash;and can expect the Minister this morning to do the same. The Government have known for many months that they would introduce the Bill. It has only 20 clauses. The issue is not complicated, except in the detail of its administration.</p>
<p>I referred earlier to the way in which tax credits have worked&mdash;or rather have not worked. One of the reasons why the tax credit system does not work properly is that the detail of its administration is neither thorough nor good. We all know from cases in our constituencies that the tax credit system does not work. I accept that the intention behind the provisions is good, but I do not want them not to work just because their detail has not been considered properly. However, we as a Committee cannot consider the detail when it is not laid before us. I feel strongly about the matter and I hope that the Minister will take it up.</p>
<p>On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said:</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&ldquo;That is probably a heroic ambition&rdquo;.&mdash;[<span class="italic">Official Report</span>, 5 December 2005; Vol. 440, c. 650.]</p>
<p>If it were his ambition to bring forth the regulations at the proper time, it is perfectly within his power as Secretary of State to achieve that ambition. I admire his ambition, but I deplore the fact that he has not &nbsp; done so, given that he could easily have achieved it if he had wanted to. All that needs to happen is for further consideration of the Bill to be postponed until such time as we have the regulations before us. There is no reason why that cannot happen.</p>

<p> I feel that I have been told off by the hon. Lady. However, she has the whole situation wrong. She does not understand how parliamentary procedure operates. If the Government had been operating out of order, Mr. Bayley, you would have stopped the discussions.</p>
<p>It may be useful if I explain the process. The Committee must remember that the Government want change and want it to happen in a particular way. They are using all the better regulation aspects that they can in introducing legislation. The format that is followed is: first the Green Paper, then the White Paper, and then the Bill and the regulations that flow from it. When it is possible to put the draft regulations before hon. Members when they discuss matters in Committee, the Government try to do that. This morning&rsquo;s example of the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for North Norfolk using probing amendments to persuade the Government to change their mind would be lost if the Government had said in Committee, &ldquo;This is all that we will do. We will not change our view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we discuss clauses, we examine the objectives and the principles behind what we are trying to achieve and, through the regulatory process and SIs, apply those regulations by using the affirmative or the negative procedure. I shall come on to what we shall do under the Bill later. We try to stick to a consultation period of about 12 weeks, so that we can give stakeholders the opportunity to consider what the Government intend to do and then try to make sure that the regulations fit that intention. As we know, regulations can be changed without the need for further primary legislation, so it is useful to have regulations that flow from primary measures. That procedure works.</p>
<p>As for the other place, it introduces Bills. It introduced the Company Law Reform Bill, which will come to us in the new year. It is not unusual for the other place to deal with issues that have not been dealt with in this place.</p>

<p> I hear what the Minister says. His explanation was clear. In that case, why did the Secretary of State say that he had a heroic ambition to bring the regulations before us in Committee?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-12-13_C_01-0_2005-12-13a.9.33" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" time="12:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/a/st051213/am/51213s05.htm" colnum="39">
<p> The Secretary of State is a hard taskmaster and is optimistic about what can be achieved within a framework. He has asked us to speed the process up as much as we can.</p>
<p>The Bill is taking broad powers to provide eligible fathers with an additional period of paternity leave for a maximum of 26 weeks, some of which will be paid if certain criteria are met. At present in the Bill, for a &nbsp; father, or partner of an adopter, to receive additional statutory paternity pay, he must have satisfied certain criteria relating to length of service and earnings.</p>
<p>In addition, the child&rsquo;s mother or adopter must have returned to work, have been entitled to statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance or statutory adoption pay, and have some of that entitlement remaining at the time of their return to work. As we have said, the detail will be provided in the accompanying regulations and we shall consult on the outstanding details of the policy early in the new year.</p>
<p>As additional paternity leave and pay is a new concept, we want to ensure that we alleviate any concerns and deliver a straightforward scheme that minimises the burdens on business, while offering more choice and flexibility to parents and, ultimately, a scheme that works.</p>
<p>We agree with hon. Members that the House should have the opportunity to consider the detail in the additional paternity leave and pay regulations. For that reason, we have made those provisions subject to the affirmative procedure. Paragraph 22 of schedule 1 amends section 176 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to provide that regulations made under new sections 171ZEA to 171ZEE of that Act, relating to additional statutory paternity pay, are to be made by the affirmative procedure. That covers regulations made under the powers set out in clauses 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Paragraph 43 amends section 236 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 to provide that regulations made under new sections 80AA and 80BB of that Act are to be made by the affirmative procedure. That covers regulations made under powers conferred by clauses 3 and 4 and also covers clause 5, although amendments to that clause have not been tabled.</p>
<p>On clause 12, many hon. Members will know that legislation on flexible working was fully debated as part of the passage of the Employment Act 2002. At that time, it was agreed that the procedural requirements would be subject to the affirmative procedure, while the eligibility, complaints and remedies would be subject to negative procedure. In consequence of this Bill, we intend only to amend the eligibility regulations. It is therefore appropriate that such amendments should be made by negative procedure.</p>
<p>I fully recognise the spirit behind the amendment and the Committee&rsquo;s desire to discuss and help shape the regulations. Our record in developing the right to request flexible working, from the original taskforce to the recent work and families consultation, shows our commitment to full consultation and debate. We always consider the needs and views of all interested parties, whether they be unions, employers, employees, parents&rsquo; groups or carers&rsquo; groups. Of course, we welcome and encourage the views of Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>The changes to the regulations will be subject to a full and extensive consultation, in which I hope everyone here will participate. I hope to publish the consultation early in the new year and we shall discuss &nbsp; it extensively with all the interested parties: businesses&mdash;both large and small&mdash;and their representatives, and carers and carers&rsquo; groups.</p>

<p> As I said, the consultation usually takes about 12 weeks; that is the recognised procedure that we try to adopt, and we shall try to meet that timetable. Then we shall need time to consider the consultation; we shall then bring forward the regulations. We could be talking about 16 or 17 weeks for the regulations to be applied.</p>
<p>In light of my explanations about the need to have discussions, I hope that the hon. Member for North Norfolk feels that I have set out the position on the procedures that will be used and I ask him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p> I want to say a few words on the clause. It is important that fathers and adopters who take additional paternity leave are protected whilst on that leave and after they have taken it. Current legislation on maternity and paternity leave provides protection for employees during and after taking any leave entitlement. Section 80C of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides for regulations to be made to ensure that a person absent on paternity leave is entitled, for such purposes and to such extent as may be prescribed, to benefit from the terms and conditions of employment that would have applied had he not been absent. It also provides that an employee on paternity leave is bound by obligations arising under those terms and conditions for such purposes and to such extent as may be prescribed. He is also entitled to return to a job of a kind prescribed in regulations.</p>
<p>The clause amends section 80C to allow comparable regulations to be made in respect of terms and conditions applying during additional paternity leave, whether following birth or adoption, and in respect of rights of return from additional paternity leave. That will encourage employees to feel confident about taking such leave entitlements and ensure that there is no adverse treatment of fathers or adopters who take advantage of the new leave right. We wish to consult further on the exact terms and conditions to be applied and what the right of return will be, but it is envisaged that they will follow the provisions that apply to either ordinary or additional maternity leave.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in clause 7, page 6, line 11, leave out &lsquo;adoption&rsquo; and insert &lsquo;paternity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This Government amendment is designed to correct an error in the drafting of the Bill. Clause 7(1) refers to &ldquo;additional statutory adoption pay&rdquo;, but it should read additional statutory paternity pay. In the case of an adoption, it will allow the eligible partner of an adopter to receive additional statutory paternity pay.</p>

<p> To slow the pace down a little, I should like to speak to clause 7.</p>
<p>In response to the growing demand for fathers to have greater opportunities to care for their child and have the option to be the primary carer, the Government are committed to introducing new legislation to provide parents with more choice and flexibility in caring for their children during the first year of the child&rsquo;s life. Provisions have been made for &nbsp; adoptive parents to enjoy the same rights as birth parents during the first year of the child&rsquo;s placement for adoption. The introduction of a new right for partners of adopters to take an additional period of paternity leave will provide adoptive parents with that. Although provisions are being taken to allow partners up to a maximum of 26 weeks&rsquo; additional paternity leave, we wish to take powers to allow part of this period to be paid.</p>
<p>Clause 7 inserts new section 171ZEB in part 12ZA of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. The new section will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations entitling employees who satisfy certain conditions to additional statutory paternity pay following the placement of a child for adoption, as set out in subsection (1). Additional statutory paternity pay will be paid by employers who can recover most or all of it from the state, and it will be administered by employers in the same way as statutory paternity pay.</p>
<p>Subsection (2) provides for conditions that should be satisfied in order for someone to be entitled to additional statutory paternity pay. The person will be the partner of a person with whom a child has been placed for adoption&mdash;an &ldquo;adopter&rdquo;&mdash;or, if the child is jointly adopted by a couple, the member of the couple who does not take statutory adoption pay in respect of the adoption. Those conditions include the relationship with the child and the child&rsquo;s adopter, the detail of which would be set out in regulations, and the employee&rsquo;s employment status and earnings, the detail of which would again be set out in regulations.</p>
<p>Subsection (2) provides also for conditions that the adopter must meet for the partner to be entitled to additional statutory paternity pay: the adopter should have been entitled to statutory adoption pay and have some of that entitlement remaining, and they must have taken action that is treated as returning to work. That is set out in subsection (2)(f).</p>
<p>The regulations will set out exactly what constitutes return to work. The aim of this provision is to ensure that there is only one payment stream and only one partner off work to care for the child at any time. It will be the choice of the adopter if he or she wishes to return to work and when he or she does so.</p>
<p>The intention is that a partner would be able to receive additional statutory paternity pay only for the remainder of the period during which the adopter would have been entitled to statutory adoption pay had they not returned to work. For example, an adopter returning to work after 30 weeks of statutory adoption pay would enable an eligible partner to take nine weeks paid additional paternity leave. A partner would still be able to take unpaid additional paternity leave for a maximum of 26 weeks until the child&rsquo;s first birthday.</p>
<p>The intention is that by the end of this Parliament we shall extend statutory adoption pay to 52 weeks from the 39 weeks that will be in place in April 2007. That would mean that under the same scenario, a partner would be entitled to up to 22 weeks paid additional paternity leave.</p>
<p>There has been a growing request for legislation to provide for circumstances in which the child&rsquo;s mother dies. We have taken the opportunity to include in this clause, at subsection (3), a provision to allow some of the conditions in subsection (2) to be excluded or modified if the child&rsquo;s adopter dies, so that the partner could take a longer period of paid leave. Again, we shall consult on the regulations.</p>
