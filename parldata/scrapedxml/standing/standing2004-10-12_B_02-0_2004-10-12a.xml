<p> As I was saying when this morning's sitting ended, I am well aware that my right hon. Friend the Minister has made interesting arrangements to involve young people in the selection of the Children's Commissioner and in other aspects of our work. I am sure that we shall hear more about that.</p>
</speech>

<p> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of something that he said this morning, which was that two representatives on the board to assist with appointing the Children's Commissioner were drawn from his constituency. I am sure that we welcome that. I wonder whether two representatives can be drawn from all the other constituencies represented in the House.</p>

<p> I actually took care not to say that the two representatives were from my constituency. They are from the Lancaster and Wyre district; I do not think that either of them is from my constituency. What they are, as the hon. Gentleman will be interested to know, is young people who are very involved in the local youth council and in work with the national youth parliaments. They are very engaged in local and national issues involving children.</p>

<p> The serious point in my intervention was how the representatives were selected and who appointed them. Are people in other districts&mdash;or counties, where there are no districts&mdash;equally well represented?</p>

<p> I have not the faintest idea how the representatives were selected, but I suspect that my right hon. Friend the Minister will tell us.</p>

<p> To help the Committee, let me say that the reference is to the new Children and Youth Board, which is a group of 25 young people who advise me. They were appointed through Children's Express, so they were not directly appointed by me or the Department. Children's Express will have to speak for itself as to how it went about the selection process, but the framework that we gave it was to establish a group that was truly representative of all interests. I have met the group only once, but its members are representative.</p>
<p> I remember a representative from the area represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson). She was a very articulate and strong woman who had had a lot of experience on a difficult estate on her patch and talked a lot about her life growing up there. There is representation in terms of age and gender, and there are some children with learning disabilities and one or two children who have been in the looked-after system. </p>
<p> That is a pretty broad range, but the group is not representative and is not an elected body in the way that the United Kingdom Youth Parliament is. </p>

<p> Moving swiftly on, I have a couple of brief points. This morning, the Minister mentioned the results of the HeadsUp forum consultation, which took place online. I took part in it and other hon. Members had the opportunity to do so in September. I believe that every member of the Committee has received a report of that consultation involving young people. One question for the Minister relates to whether she will be able to take into account their views about the Children's Commissioner in the work that she is undertaking with the Children and Youth Board. I found the consultation an invaluable experience, and a great deal of excellent information came from it. The process of an online consultation with children whereby they debate the issues before Parliament was a very interesting way to involve young people in the work of parliamentary democracy.</p>
<p> I shall offer only one quote from the consultation. It was said that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''the commissioner should understand that kids r gonna cum up with impossible ideas which may seem crazy but could be adapted to become possible''. </span></p>
<p>I hope that in a similar spirit my right hon. Friend will give a sympathetic ear to amendment No. 58, which is in my name and seeks to ensure that children and young people are involved not only in the appointment of a Children's Commissioner, but also in scrutinising and evaluating the work of that commissioner and in their reappointment after five years. As we know, the commissioner will be appointed for five years with a possibility of being reappointed for one further term, and children and young people should have a crucial role in deciding whether that person has done a good job and served their interests well. </p>

<p> I shall speak briefly in support of amendments Nos. 6, 191, 58 and 192. Other hon. Members have admirably covered the point that the involvement of young people and children would give rise to more confidence in the appointment. In particular, I shall dwell on the perceptiveness that children and young people have in particular circumstances. I imagine that most of us have been involved in situations in which young people have played a part in an appointment procedure&mdash;for example, at a local youth club&mdash;and it is a very rewarding experience. What we are talking about would obviously be on a wider scale and I appreciate that the Minister has set up a special board. I ask her to give particular attention to these four amendments and I hope that something can be introduced to the Bill that would demonstrate the Government's</p>
<p> commitment to the world at large. Not everybody knows of the good work that the Minister is doing behind the scenes.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-10-12_B_02-0_2004-10-12a.4.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1323" speakername="Hywel Williams" time="14:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/b/st041012/pm/41012s01.htm" colnum="36">
<p> I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 192 and 191. First, regarding the appointment of the commissioner, as the amendments point out, it is vitally important to consult children from all areas for which the commissioner will have a remit&mdash;the Government intend the Children's Commissioner to have a remit in Wales. It is also important for the Government to consult children's organisations for their unique insights. There are a number of Welsh-based children's organisations that the Minister will be familiar with including Plant Yng Nghymru&mdash;Children in Wales. Amendments Nos. 119 and 6 and new clause 19 refer to the UK Youth Parliament as representing children. As I said, there are particular Welsh bodies, such as the Welsh Youth Parliament&mdash;the Minister will recall Funky Dragon&mdash;and Plant Yng Nghymru.</p>
<p> I shall also refer briefly to amendment No. 192 and the issue of scrutiny. It is vitally important that children are able to scrutinise the operation of the Children's Commissioner on a long-term basis. As a former Secretary of State for Wales said in respect of devolution, it is a process, not an event. Certainly, the work of the commissioner will be a process, not a one-off event. I emphasise two points: the need to scrutinise as a long-term measure and to consult properly with children in Wales. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-10-12_B_02-0_2004-10-12a.4.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/965" speakername="Margaret Hodge" time="14:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/b/st041012/pm/41012s01.htm" colnum="36">
<p> I shall deal first with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) about the UK Youth Parliament. We have probably all worked with the UK Youth Parliament and find it very invigorating and challenging to respond to the issues raised. The Government recognise it as a good organisation that encourages civic responsibility and engagement by young people. Hon. Members will be pleased to know that we support it not only with an annual sum of money to help to keep it going but, more recently, I have identified additional resources to help to implement some of the recommendations from the Office for Public Management's review to ensure that that parliament is more representative of young people. We were able to grant extra money to help it to implement those recommendations.</p>
<p> I hope that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight will accept that many other organisations represent young people. Off the top of my head, I can think of the British Youth Council, the Carnegie Young People Initiative, the National Youth Agency and a number of children's organisations such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Barnardo's. All would purport, in some way or another, to represent young people's views. The hon. Gentleman frowns at me a little, but I believe that it would be invidious to select one young persons' organisation over another. That is always the difficulty in finding a representative body to ensure that young people's interests are properly reflected in our decision-making processes. </p>
<p> The main purport behind many of the amendments is to question whether we are involving children and young people in the appointment of our first commissioner. I can assure the Committee that we are. I have already described the Children and Youth Board that we have established and with which I have had one meeting. We intend to support its training so that it can participate in the process of determining the job description and help us to select the first Children's Commissioner. </p>
<p> I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman on another point. In my long intervention, I did not get time to say that two or three members of the Children and Youth Board are also members of the UKYP. I am sure that he will welcome that cross-representation. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 6, tabled by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) and others, proposes to include something to reflect the involvement of children and young people in the appointment of the Children's Commissioner. I listened to the argument and have some sympathy with the idea. As always with legal drafting, there are a few problems with the precise wording. However, I hope that he will bear with me and that we can table an amendment on Report to ensure that we include in the Bill a provision for the involvement of children and young people in the appointment. All Committee members will welcome that. </p>
<p> I should tell the Committee something about the process of the appointment. As ever, it will be informed by guidance from the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Although I said in an aside that the Secretary of State or I could be a member of the appointing panel if we so wished, we have chosen not to do that, because we believe that that could be seen as interfering with the independence of the appointment of the commissioner. We will not be engaged in the appointment, which will be conducted under the guidance I mentioned. I hope that we will draw together a group of people who reflect the appropriate interests to be responsible for that appointment, taking people from both the non-statutory sector and the civil service and engaging children and young people. </p>
<p> To give some comfort to the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams), I can tell him that the board that advises me has two representatives from Wales out of the 25, which is proportionate and appropriate. One of them is also a member of Funky Dragon, and I gather that the other one is considering whether to join Funky Dragon. I hope that that deals with the issues of appointment. </p>
<p> There are also a couple of amendments on the scrutiny and accountability of the commissioner. In a sense, the discussion that we had this morning about promoting the awareness of the interests and concerns of children was on the wording to reflect how important the Government feel it is for the commissioner to engage with children and young people in all his work. I have a lot of sympathy for the spirit of what the amendments are designed to achieve, but the problem is with the practicalities of establishing how such a system of accountability to </p>
<p> children and young people could be established, who they would be and how their appropriateness and legitimacy as an accountable group of young people could be justified. </p>
<p> I share with the Committee that concern: at my first meeting with the Children and Youth Board, which was selected by Children's Express, most of the young people were 16 or 17-year olds&mdash;among the older age group. We know that the years are very fast-changing in a child's or a young person's life; for example, attitudes to school among 16 and 17-year-olds are different from those among 10, 11 and 12-year-olds. A discussion about our extended schools policy would have a different content if we were to consult 16-year-olds as opposed to 12-year-olds. There is always a worry at the back of one's mind when listening to a group of children and young people that it is not reflecting the whole group. That is why I have difficulty with the precise amendments, but I hope that I can provide comfort for both hon. Members, because I share the spirit of them. </p>
<p> The accountability will come through us in Parliament. The commissioner will be obliged to place a report annually before Parliament. I hope that the report will be taken seriously by the appropriate Select Committee, which at this point will be the Education and Skills Committee. I hope that it will call the commissioner to account and, as part of that process, question children as to whether the commissioner has sufficiently fulfilled his or her functions in responding to children's interests and listening to their needs. I hope that, having heard what I have said on the subject, both hon. Members will withdraw their amendments about that scrutiny. I hope, too, that I can provide comfort to all other hon. Members about how we shall set about appointing the commissioner by assuring them that on Report I shall table an amendment that involves children and young people in the appointment process. </p>

<p> I frowned because I felt that although the bodies that the Minister mentioned may represent children, they do not necessarily involve children. I welcome her promise to suggesting some new wording on Report which will fulfil her promises and solidify the process into which she has already entered. I am interested to know that that not only are there two representatives from north Lancashire on the Children and Youth Board, but two for the whole of the Principality of Wales; I hope that isolated and rural areas are equally well represented. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
<p> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-10-12_B_02-0_2004-10-12a.4.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1055" speakername="Tim Loughton" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/b/st041012/pm/41012s02.htm" colnum="38">
<p> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in</p>
<p><span class="indent">schedule 1, page 36, line 32, at end insert&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">'or,</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">(c) significantly failed in the discharge of any of his functions'.</span></p>
<p> This is a probing amendment to schedule 1, concerning the hopefully unlikely event of getting rid of a commissioner who is not up to scratch. An identical amendment was tabled in another place by Earl Howe, who was not entirely convinced by the answer from the Minister there. The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to remove the commissioner from office if </p>
<p><span class="indent">''he is satisfied that he has&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">(a) become unfit or unable properly to discharge his functions; or</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">(b) behaved in a way that is not compatible with his continuing in office.''</span></p>
<p> That does not seem to cover all angles, because it is possible for the commissioner to be fit, both physically and mentally, and by common consent still to have failed in the performance of his duties. To whom will the commissioner be accountable for an assessment of his performance, not only as to whether he is up to the job, but as to whether he is doing a good job? </p>
<p> The issue arose earlier. What happens if, on the face of it, the commissioner is doing his job perfectly well&mdash;turning up at the office at the requisite times&mdash;but he has completely lost the confidence of children, whose champion he is supposed to be, by failing to produce the reports as required under the Bill? It seems that the only criterion missing for his being sacked by the Secretary of State is that of not doing his job terribly well. </p>
<p> Later amendments relate to assessing the worth of the job of commissioner and whether the new measure is working. After three or five years the legislation should be considered to see whether we should tighten up the grounds on which the commissioner can properly be sacked, as I can envisage some escape clauses. The last thing we want is a lame-duck commissioner who escapes being sacked because of the Bill's strict wording. </p>
<p> There is a wider point: we want Parliament to have a greater role. We would like the commissioner to be much more responsible and accountable to Parliament, and we shall table separate amendments relating to how he will report on his job. Is not there a role for Parliament to assess whether the commissioner is doing his job properly? If not, we should consider how Parliament could make a strong recommendation that a new commissioner be found. </p>
<p> This is a probing amendment, as the Minister in the other place did not cover all the angles. </p>

<p> To answer the hon. Gentleman's question, the commissioner will be accountable to Ministers; accountability to Parliament will come through the annual report laid before Parliament. As I said, I would expect the Select Committee to want to interview the commissioner about that report to see how well he or she had fulfilled their duties as described in the report. There would be nothing to stop the Select Committee undertaking a review of the commissioner's role and considering how well he or</p>
<p> she was fulfilling their functions in relation to the measure. Accountability to Parliament will be through that mechanism&mdash;directly to Ministers.</p>

<p> I am interested in how the process will work. The Treasury Committee, for example, has a relationship with the Governor of the Bank of England, who makes an annual report and comes for interview. Does the Minister envisage that the Education and Skills Committee will call the commissioner for annual interview? She would not try to impose her will on it, but would the Minister ideally like a Sub-Committee of the Select Committee to have a specific responsibility for children's issues and the Commissioner and be given that particular role?</p>

<p> That is an interesting idea. Far be it from me to determine how the Select Committees decide to pursue their responsibilities. As Minister for Children, Young People and Families, I have responsibilities that go beyond the departmental parameters, so I have appeared before several Select Committees of the House as well as committees of the Department for Education and Skills. Presumably, some of the Select Committees will want to interview the commissioner on a range of issues that they are considering. It is a matter for the House, and it is for hon. Members to determine it as they see fit.</p>

<p> While the Minister cogitates on how the Select Committee may want to scrutinise the work of the commissioner, she might want to explore a further suggestion. She will know that the Treasury Committee holds confirmatory hearings of nominees for the Monetary Policy Committee.

<p> Order. Before the Minister responds to that question, I should point out that we are moving slightly away from the subject of the amendment, which concerns whether the commissioner has</p>
<p><span class="indent">''significantly failed in the discharge of any of his functions.'' </span></p>
<p>Can I bring the Committee back to that point? </p>

<p> I do not know whether you are telling me not to respond to that question, Mr. Benton. Again, however, that is a matter for the House to determine. This particular post-holder is answerable primarily to children, which is why we are anxious to involve children and young people in his or her appointment.</p>
<p> We do not believe that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is necessary. We believe that there are sufficient powers provided for in schedule 1 to remove the commissioner. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to paragraph 3(6)(b), which states that the commissioner may be removed if he has </p>
<p><span class="indent">''behaved in a way that is not compatible with his continuing in office.''</span></p>
<p> That could be interpreted as meaning that he or she has </p>
<p><span class="indent">''significantly failed in the discharge of any of his functions.'' </span></p>
<p>as stated in the amendment. I think that a failure to discharge the functions of the post would be covered by the provision in sub-paragraph (6)(b). </p>
<p> The Committee will be anxious for us to do all that we can to ensure the independence of the commissioner. If we overload powers of intervention&mdash;and, if necessary, of dismissal&mdash;on to the Secretary of State, the use of those powers could quickly be interpreted as the Secretary of State interfering with the commissioner's independence. We have had to draw a fine line between ensuring that we have sufficient powers to do precisely what the hon. Gentleman wants us to do&mdash;ensure that the commissioner does his job properly&mdash;without being seen to interfere in his independence. </p>
<p> I also draw to hon. Members' attention the fact that we examined the wording of the schedule in the context of that used in the legislation governing the Children's Commissioner for Wales, the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland and the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, and it is not dissimilar. We therefore feel comfortable that it gives us sufficient authority to do what the Opposition demand. </p>

<p> I am grateful for that clarification. The amendment was a probing one. I certainly would not wish, through any of the amendments that we have tabled, to overload the Secretary of State with powers&mdash;quite the opposite. That is why, ideally, we would like to see some mechanism that would give greater powers to Parliament, a Select Committee, or a Sub-Committee of a Select Committee. I am reassured that the Minister envisages the development of that sort of relationship with a Select Committee. The Education and Skills Committee might want to consider the interesting suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) that there should be confirmatory hearings similar to those held for the Bank of England.</p>
<p> Given that the Minister said that the provision was not greatly at variance with the legislation for the other commissioners already in situ in the United Kingdom, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. </p>

<p> This is a probing amendment, which concerns the funding and independence of the Children's Commissioner. Looking at the debate in the House of Lords, it seemed to me that the Constitution Committee had severe doubts as to whether there was sufficient provision for the commissioner to exercise his functions independently of the Secretary of State. Having the funding determined by the Secretary of State seemed to it seriously to jeopardise the commissioner's independence.</p>
<p> This was debated in some detail in the Lords, and other organisations have argued that the funding undermines the independence of the commissioner and could unduly affect his work. The Government responded by saying that this is standard wording. I am ready to accept that, but I wonder whether I could tempt the Minister to reassure us that she has taken those comments on board. </p>

<p> I have some sympathy with the line of inquiry that the hon. Gentleman has just taken. Amendment No. 5 is a probing amendment. It seeks to ensure the independence of the Children's Commissioner, which we are keen to reinforce in the Bill. The Minister appears to have some sympathy with that. What does</p>
<p><span class="indent">''on such conditions (if any)''</span></p>
<p> mean? It is obviously appropriate for the Secretary of State to decide on the total budget that is given to the Children's Commissioner. Without wishing to make a spending commitment, in view of the relative amounts in the budget likely to be allocated to the new commissioner for England, as opposed to the existing commissioner, and given the relative populations&mdash;some 84 per cent. of the population of the United Kingdom lives in England&mdash;one wonders whether the resources are sufficient. Perhaps the resources already allocated to the other commissioners are over-generous. I do not want to say more than that. </p>
<p> It is obviously appropriate for the Secretary of State to decide on the total budget, but not to constrain how it is to be spent. The last thing we want is further ring-fencing of the money allocated to the Children's Commissioner. We are fervently against that, and I thought that the Government were at last showing signs of reversing that policy, having ring-fenced so much money, particularly in health, education and social services. The wording in this part of schedule appears to be too wide. In the upper House Baroness Ashton of Upholland gave an undertaking to look at it again. She claimed that the wording mirrors the Care Standards Act 2000 under which the National Assembly for Wales funds the Welsh commissioner. </p>
<p> Under the Bill it is up to the Children's Commissioner to determine his or her priorities. Are we are talking about purely supplementary payments that may be issued by the Secretary of State in order to fund specific inquiries or research projects or to set up new structures that he has authorised&mdash;that is, of course, ring-fencing&mdash;or will some caveats or </p>
<p> restrictions be placed on the whole budget that the commissioner gets, which would inevitably mean some curtailing of independence? </p>
<p> When Baroness Ashton gave the mirroring of the Care Standards Act as the reason for this, she did not explain why it was necessary to mirror those terms. I will be grateful if the Minister can assure us that we are in no way trying to hamstring the Children's Commissioner in terms of the way in which he or she spends his or her budget. We would have severe reservations about an attempt to do so and it would be against the rationale for the independence of the commissioner that the Minister has advanced. I would be grateful for her reassurances on that score, hence amendment No. 5. </p>

<p> I shall deal first with the budget that has been set for the commissioner, because a number of hon. Members and organisations outside the House have expressed concern about it in relation to the budgets for other commissioners. We believe that the budget is sufficient. It reflects the fact that we expect the English commissioner to fulfil a different role from that of commissioners in the other countries. Of course, as with all these things&mdash;I was involved when we embarked on setting up the Disability Rights Commission&mdash;we will have to reflect on the experience of the first year or so of operation of the Children's Commissioner to ensure that the role is properly and effectively funded. I can assure the Committee that we will do that.</p>

<p> We are in danger of reopening the argument that we had this morning. In my view, the role is different and more appropriate. I look forward to debates with the hon. Lady over time as we see the strength of this champion for children impacting on our lives as parliamentarians. We shall see whose judgement at this stage, before we establish the post and see how the commissioner works, is right, but it is a different role and one that deliberately focuses on the bigger picture. In my view, it will have an enormous impact not only on us as parliamentarians but on all organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors that in one way or another impact on children's lives. I have simply been trying to respond to the question raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about how we had arrived at a different budget head&mdash;it is because of the different role.</p>
<p> Hon. Members have clearly read the record of the debate that took place on these issues in the House of Lords. The justification for the wording in the schedule is that it is the wording that we always use for non-departmental public bodies. It is a standard condition to ensure that the money that is voted for the commissioner is spent on the functions within the scope of his power. </p>
<p> We added the words ''and on such conditions'' because there may well be situations under clauses 4 and 5 in which the Secretary of State wants to give additional moneys to the commissioner, either to carry out an inquiry that the commissioner has instigated or has been asked to conduct by the Secretary of State. In those instances, we would want the commissioner to use for that purpose alone the moneys allocated for that purpose. </p>

<p> Is the Minister specifically saying that the words</p>
<p><span class="indent">''and on such conditions (if any)'' </span></p>
<p>will apply solely to supplementary funds, not to the main budget? If so, would it not be clearer to add an amendment specifying that those words refer to supplementary funds? I see that a bit of in-flight refuelling is going on. If what she has told me is right, we will have no problem in withdrawing the amendment, but given the in-flight refuelling that she has had, can she reflect on whether what she is saying is correct? </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman will see the exchange of notes across the Committee. My only slight problem with giving the assurance that he seeks is that I would not want to create a constraint in saying that it was only for inquiries under clauses 4 and 5 that one would choose to give particular moneys. We may well want the commissioner to undertake a particular project on an issue&mdash;I am trying to think of one. Perhaps we have all been during the lunch break to the Young People Now reception on the subject of how children are portrayed in the media. There may be a general interest, supported by the Secretary of State, in a project about how young people are portrayed in the media, so the Secretary of State could provide additional resources for such a project. We would not want to curtail specific funding of such projects.</p>
<p> I can give the hon. Gentleman an assurance, and he will undoubtedly then want to come back to me. There is absolutely no suggestion in this amendment, or in the way that the schedule on funding has been written, that we shall interfere at all in the generality of the way in which the commissioner chooses to spend the money that we shall give him. I can give the Committee a total and utter assurance that we shall not seek in any way to stop the commissioner undertaking a particular task or investigation or reviewing an issue. That is not at all the purpose of the wording in the schedule. </p>

<p> I had rather suspected that the Minister would not accept my amendment with open arms. It refers to</p>
<p><span class="indent">''expenditure incurred by virtue of this Act'', </span></p>
<p>and that is a broad definition. Perhaps, as elegantly as I can, I can pirouette and argue the other side of the case. There is a sum of money, and as other hon. Members have already asked, will that be sufficient for the commissioner's work in England? There is also the work of the commissioner in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and my particular concern, arguing from the other side, is whether there will be sufficient money for the work there. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred to ring-fencing and </p>
<p> the Minister spoke about not predetermining how the commissioner should spend his or her money. Can she assure the Committee that there will be sufficient moneys for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland? As she knows, my particular concern is about the extra expenditure incurred in providing a proper bilingual service in Wales. </p>

<p> Again, in the spirit of not wishing to intervene in the commissioner's independence, our view is that the general sum that we will give the commissioner will be sufficient for him to carry out all his duties, including those in Wales on non-devolved issues that impact on children. Should it come to pass that there is a specific inquiry, under clauses 4 or 5, that takes place in Wales, that is just the sort of situation where a specified sum from the Secretary of State to the commissioner will be provided so that such an inquiry will take place and be properly funded. Should there be a particular project&mdash;again, I cannot think of one off the top of my head&mdash;that the Secretary of State and the commissioner agree ought to be undertaken, which impacts only on Wales, that would be the circumstance in which a specific sum would be provided to carry out that work.</p>

<p> I think we have got somewhere; the phrase that the Minister used to assure was that she was not seeking to interfere with the generality of the way in which the children's commissioner spends the money given to him. I think that that means that we are talking only about supplemental spending. She did not quite use those terms of assurance, but everything that she said suggested that that was what she means, although she will not quite commit herself to confirm that or to specify it in the Bill. It is important&mdash;we are not just talking semantics here.</p>
<p> We need to ensure that the Children's Commissioner will have the full and resourced independence to do the job that is tasked to him by the legislation. If the Government announce the budget for the commissioner each year and say that they expect him to spend 10 per cent. of that money in a particular area, that will compromise his independence. If the Government are merely talking about specific project funding, whether to run an inquiry or conduct research on children's portrayal in the media, as mentioned earlier today, we would have no trouble with that. However, one would hope that the initiation for such an inquiry would come from the commissioner, who would seek funds about which the Government could take a decision. </p>
<p> I want to return to the issue of funding, because we clearly have worries. The Children's Commissioner for Wales has a staff of 22, his budget for the current year is &#163;1.4 million, and according to the 2001 census, the population of under-18-year-olds is just over 662,000. The Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People has a slightly larger staff of 29, a budget of &#163;1.4 million for the first year, rising to &#163;1.9 million, and a smaller population of about 500,000 under-19-year-olds to look after&mdash;a slightly different age specification. In Scotland, the commissioner has a staff </p>
<p> of 15, yet despite having the largest number of children of the three to look after&mdash;1.2 million under-19-year-olds&mdash;her budget is &#163;1.2 million a year and &#163;1.5 million in the first year. </p>
<p> According to the Minister's Department, the estimated running costs of the commissioner in England will be &#163;2.5 million per annum, yet the population is almost 10 times that of Scotland&mdash;somewhere between 10.5 million and 11 million under the age of 18. There is a discrepancy between the amount of resources available to our commissioner and what the other commissioners get. That will clearly throw up question marks and concerns about whether the Children's Commissioner will be properly resourced to do the job that we are giving him. </p>
<p> I hope, as the Minister appears to be saying, that there will be no financial straitjackets put on the commissioner and that paragraph 7 will be pertinent merely to supplemental funding for specific projects. If that is the case, we will be happy not to press what is a probing amendment. I hope that her assurances lead us down that route, although she has not set it out in black and white as I asked. </p>

<p> To return to the Minister's previous comments, I was reassured by what she said and her confirmation that my understanding was correct. I am also reassured by her remarks about funding for specific inquiries should they be required in Wales. I know that she is mindful of the particular situation that we have in Wales, so given her remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am also told that it does not require primary legislation to ensure that Members of the Welsh Assembly or the Scottish Parliament are disqualified from holding the post of the commissioner for England. That would be for them to determine when deciding who was eligible to be a Member of the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh Assembly. The measure will determine who is eligible to be a Member of the UK Parliament; the English commissioner will not be eligible.</p>

<p> I accept that, but paragraph 13 on page 38 states that they are disqualified from membership of the Northern Ireland Assembly, too. Obviously, it is</p>
<p> partly for the protection of the Parliament itself, but as to the commissioner's responsibility, how can someone hold an office under the Crown and be a Member of a political body of that kind?</p>

<p> This is such a technical issue. I am told that the Bill has to legislate in relation to the Northern Ireland Assembly and to our own Parliament. Section 15(1)(d) of the Scotland Act 1998 states that a person is disqualified from being a Member of the Parliament if</p>
<p><span class="indent">''he is an office-holder of a description specified in an Order in Council made by Her Majesty under this subsection.'' </span></p>
<p>The order has to be made through the Scottish Parliament. </p>
<p> Equally, section 12(1)(b) of the Government of Wales Act 1998 states that a person is disqualified from being an Assembly Member if </p>
<p><span class="indent">''he holds any of the offices for the time being designated by Order in Council as offices disqualifying persons from being Assembly members''. </span></p>
<p>That must be done through the Welsh Assembly and not through this Parliament. That is what I am told; it is a pure technicality that we have responsibility for the UK Parliament and Northern Ireland and we do not have the responsibility in primary legislation for disqualifying people from being Members of the Scottish Parliament or of the Welsh Assembly. </p>

<p> The amendments raise some serious issues, which we should explore. My amendment would strengthen the Bill. It is designed to ensure that the Children's Commissioner is completely committed to encouraging people to take account of children's views and interests, to advising the Secretary of State on those views and interests, and to reviewing and</p>
<p> reporting on the effectiveness of advice and advocacy services, complaints procedures and whistleblowing. I think that that is fair enough.</p>
<p> I am extremely concerned by the Government amendments that would replace ''review and report'' with ''consider or research'' and would delete the references to advice and advocacy and whistleblowing. For a start, ''review and report'' is plainly much stronger than ''consider or research'', and I do not see the point of changing it. Furthermore, if we are expecting the Children's Commissioner even just to consider or research complaints procedures, why should he not also consider and research advice and advocacy services? The two seem to go hand in hand, and considering the way in which local authorities and organisations have structured their services, I do not see how one could easily separate complaints procedures from advice and advocacy services in many parts of the country. </p>
<p> I am particularly concerned by the idea of excluding the provision that the Children's Commissioner should review and report on whistleblowing. It is crucial to allow those working with children to raise concerns and issues, speak publicly and tell authorities to ensure that others know when services are going wrong or children are being abused or neglected or are suffering at the hands of the state, local authority or organisation charged with their care. It is essential for a Government who are committed to dealing with the atrocious abuses that we have seen in so many parts of the care system over so many years to ensure that the independent watchdog for children&mdash;the children's champion&mdash;should be able to take a close interest in and report on the efficacy of whistleblowing activities. </p>
<p> I do not see the point of some of the Government amendments and indeed believe that some would be extremely harmful. I am seeking to strengthen this part of the Bill, and I certainly do not think that it should be weakened by replacing the important functions of reviewing and reporting with considering or researching. </p>

<p> I rise to support amendment No. 53. I was minded to propose the word ''must'' rather than ''shall'', but I did not want to be picky, so I signed up to this amendment. The provisions, as amended in the Lords, are strong, and in the same way as the Minister has conceded that a ''may'' should change to a ''shall'', I felt that the changes were very important. I can only echo the comments that aspects such as the whistleblowing arrangements inspection are so important that to have them blown out of the Bill is amazing. We should therefore reject Government amendments Nos. 166 to 168.</p>
<p> Amendment No. 167 was not touched on earlier, but bringing the outcome goals back into this part of the Bill seems singularly inappropriate. I welcome the fact that the outcome provisions were expanded in the House of Lords and that the amendments there were accepted. I am happy with them. </p>
<p> To return to our earlier discussion, but without rehearsing it again, I make it clear that the rights agenda should be the underlying principle. There is much confusion between principles and outcomes. I </p>
<p> believe that the outcome goals are in a satisfactory place in the Bill now. I therefore speak strongly against the three Government amendments. There have been great improvements in the Bill, but it is now proposed to blow them all away, which is a huge pity. </p>

<p> I have some sympathy with what was said about the amendments. They are part of the diluting of clause 2. We saw much good work in the upper House to give the Children's Commissioner real teeth. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre has quite rightly identified certain issues&mdash;I agree with him on whistleblowing&mdash;that should be covered in the Bill. The Government amendments seek to dilute what we were given in the first place.</p>
<p> I have spent many happy hours in Committees arguing the toss between ''must'' and ''shall'' and I have never won that toss in seven and a half years of Committee work. There are great diatribes of parliamentary code on why ''must'' or ''shall'' should prevail, so I do not want to go over that territory now, but the hon. Gentleman makes an important point about the new element of clause 2&mdash;and we will be discussing the rest of clause 2, which we would like to see remain largely unchanged, later. I will be sympathetic to his aims if he is going to push his point, although I am not very optimistic about achieving any change in the language. </p>

<p> There is a danger that we will regurgitate the debate that we had this morning, but this debate gives me the opportunity to say that these Government amendments reflect the purpose that we see for the commissioner. We want the commissioner to have a wider focus on outcomes and not a narrow focus on policing individual rights. That may be a difference between us in Committee. Again, experience will tell who is right with regard to the way in which we have formulated the functions of the commissioner.</p>
<p> Perhaps I can reflect a little on the transformation agenda. The five outcomes, which we have translated into parliamentary language in one of the amendments before us this afternoon, arose out of an extensive and thorough consultation exercise that we undertook with children and young people. They are the expression of what children and young people said to us mattered to them. Making their priorities the focus of what we wish the commissioner to undertake seems to me the best way of ensuring that we will have a children and young persons' champion, and not a champion of any particular interest group. I say that with all sincerity, and I recognise the commitment that many people have to the concept of the Children's Commissioner. </p>
<p> Our entire programme of reform&mdash;our entire transformation of children's services&mdash;is built around those five outcomes. When I talk about the Bill being the legislative spine, I mean that those outcomes will be reflected in the targets that we set ourselves as a Government and against which we wished to be judged, in the targets that we set for local authorities and against which they will be judged, in the targets set by the Minister responsible for community health, and </p>
<p> in the framework that he has established through the national service framework for health. They will also be reflected in the integrated inspection of children's services, which is led by Ofsted. Throughout all the work that we do, we reflect what children have told us matters to them, as described in those outcomes. </p>

<p> No is the simple and clear answer. By also stating in the Bill that the commissioner must have regard to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, we will ensure that that value system also underpins his work and that it is strongly focused in relation to the outcomes defined not by us as parliamentarians, but by children and young people.</p>

<p> I should like to place on record exactly what I said. I welcomed the outcomes appearing in part 2 of the Bill. Indeed, I have tabled an amendment that, I hope, will improve them even further. I simply did not feel that it was appropriate to include them in this part of the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-10-12_B_02-0_2004-10-12a.6.16" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/965" speakername="Margaret Hodge" time="15:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/b/st041012/pm/41012s05.htm" colnum="50">
<p> I simply reflect that the principal purpose of the Children's Commissioner will be to ensure that children and young people's views are reflected in relation to those outcomes. That is why it is important that they are in this part of the Bill. Remove them from this part of the Bill and the principal purpose of the Children's Commissioner changes in a way that will not serve the interests of children in England, and children across the whole of the UK in relation to non-devolved matters.</p>
<p> My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre talked about whistleblowing, which is extremely important. I completely concur with him on that. Again, does he not agree that we wish to have a commissioner who is utterly independent of the Government and who will not simply fulfil the priorities that he may deem important, that I may deem important or that the Committee may deem important? We want the commissioner to determine his own priorities&mdash;what he should spend time on and what he should investigate. Deleting references to certain issues is not to say that they are not important, but stops us prescribing the priorities for his work. That is all that we are attempting to do in order to </p>
<p> consolidate even further his independence. Instructing the commissioner to report on issues is tantamount to telling him how to do his job. </p>
<p> I have no doubt that the commissioner I envisage undertaking this task will wish to report on issues of importance to Parliament, to the Secretary of State and to children and young people in all sorts of ways. He will wish to publish reports. However, to prescribe how he should do his job is tantamount to interference. We want the commissioner to be as independent as possible, even if that means that he investigates matters that we would not wish him to investigate. I completely take the point that my hon. Friend made in his intervention. </p>
<p> I should like to go briefly through the Government amendments so that hon. Members are clear what we intend. The current paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (2) specify advice and advocacy services and inspection and whistleblowing arrangements as areas that the commissioner may want to review and report on. Those were the areas that are now in the Bill as a result of an amendment in another place, and they are wide ranging. They would prescribe priorities and determine the focus of the commissioner's work in a way that it is inappropriate for us to do here. I also fear that prescribing priorities in the Bill&mdash;this may be what my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre intended&mdash;would tend to drag the commissioner into individual casework. As my hon. Friend knows, we have stressed that that is not desirable. We do not want to turn the commissioner's office into an inspectorate. </p>
<p> Reinstating the outcomes in the Bill gives us a legal interpretation of what children identified as being important to them. The outcomes are also referred to in clause 7. Restoring them to clause 2 will establish the function of the commissioner in the same framework as the rest of the Bill and fully incorporate it as part of the new outcomes-based approach to children's services in England that I have described. </p>
<p> While seeking to restore the reference to the outcomes, we will retain the requirement for the commissioner to have regard to the UNCRC. The outcomes are a definition of practical, meaningful and achievable goals that children and young people said were important to them. They provide a useful focus for the commissioner's functions, and one that children themselves can easily understand. </p>
<p> I have discussed why we thought that ''consider or research'' was better than ''review and report''. Again, our wording does not prevent the commissioner from issuing reports on any subject he feels it is relevant for him to report on. It simply does not prescribe that he should do so. </p>

<p> My right hon. Friend has been extremely helpful.

<p> I am saying precisely that. The commissioner is free to do what he wishes, but we do not wish in the Bill to prescribe the priorities and functions that he ought to fulfil or the areas that he should cover.</p>

<p> In the spirit of the previous debate, I hope that we might agree that, for this one aspect of the work, we should be able to dictate how the Children's Commissioner carries out his responsibilities. My amendment would simply leave it that the commissioner must involve children in the</p>
<p> discharge of his functions. That seems perfectly reasonable and sensible, and something that the Children's Commissioner should accept as a fundamental part of their job.</p>

<p> Amendment No. 54 is eminently sensible; I cannot see why the four words are required.</p>
<p> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 2 to 4. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are simple; moreover, I do not see why the considerations described in them should not apply to the whole Bill rather than to just the clause. We ask that those considerations should apply to compiling reports, reporting to Parliament, holding inquiries and the relationship with other commissioners, and not just to clause 2. </p>
<p> In response to these probing amendments, can the Minister tell us why the provisions set out in subsections (4) and (5) are limited to clause 2? The subsections provide for the commissioner to have particular regard to groups of children </p>
<p><span class="indent">''who do not have other adequate means by which they can make their views known'' </span></p>
<p>and give the commissioner power to enter premises. Those provisions should apply to the entire role of the Children's Commissioner under all six clauses of part 1, rather than to clause 2 alone. Can she clarify the matter? </p>
<p> Amendment No. 2 was originally tabled as a probing amendment by Lord Northbourne in another place. Subsection (4) provides for the commissioner to be proactive in ascertaining and reflecting the views of disadvantaged children&mdash;that is right. However, there is no mention of the family in part 1, and very little mention of the family in the whole Bill. This morning, hon. Members mentioned the importance of the family as the first port of call in addressing children's problems, if that is at all possible. Only when breakdown and problems within the family occur do we need recourse to other help and support. The family is essential to the child's well-being, but it is not mentioned. </p>
<p> The Bill is about all children, not just those without a family and who are looked-after children&mdash;it applies to everyone. The child's welfare should not be considered in isolation from their relationship with their family. We therefore contend that, in clause 2, and probably also in clause 6, all the agencies dealing with children should make the presumption of the importance of the family. We would include in that presumption an extended family, rather than just parents&mdash;all the people who can be described as part of a child's family. I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on why family and parents are not given any prominence in the Bill, because they surely are part of the solution. All those agencies that will have to intervene on behalf of children should have regard to maintaining&mdash;if there is any chance of it&mdash;the relationship between parents and children within the family context. That is the point of amendment No. 2.</p>

<p> I support amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 54 and Government amendment No. 169. I have been arguing against most of the Government amendments, so I felt that I should say that amendment No. 169 is excellent.</p>
<p> I listened carefully to the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham speak to amendment No. 2. Although I also place great weight on the importance of the family and carers, I am rather uncertain about inclusion of the amendment at this stage of the Bill. I am going to reserve my views on that and listen to the Minister. It is a difficult balance to achieve. We know that the family and carers should, in an ideal world, be the first port of call, but sadly we do not live in an ideal world. Therefore, I am uncertain about whether such a provision would always be in the child's best interests. I want to be sure that we are always operating in the child's best interests. I shall listen to the debate on amendment No.2, but I should like to register our support for the amendments that I listed. </p>

<p> I support Government amendment No. 169. I think that it is absolutely excellent that there will be a version of the Children's Commissioner's report specifically designed for children. That has happened in Wales with the Children's Commissioner for Wales and has gone down extremely well. I am pleased about that. Can the Minister say what plans she has to publish the report in other languages? We have discussed the Welsh language already, but has she any views on the other languages that are used particularly in our cities?</p>
<p> There was discussion about the role of families in relation to children. I thought that it would be interesting to make the point that many of the 500 cases that the Children's Commissioner for Wales is dealing have come from families rather than from children even though they are about children. </p>

<p> I support the amendment, which I think is valuable, and I look forward with interest to hearing the Minister's response. I heard the comments of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and I cannot think of many circumstances in which it would not be in the interests of the child to have the support of the family when there is one to support the child. When I say ''family'', I hasten to add that I am not prescribing any particular form of family; I am not making judgments about people, how they live, or the nature of their relationships, but the interests of the family&mdash;in the sense of those looking after the child&mdash;must be taken into account, and the commissioner should have regard to the importance that such people should care for the child. They supply the child with emotional support and care. The state does not generally do that.</p>

<p> I am not trying to make a cheap shot, as this is a genuine debate. However, will the hon. Gentleman accept that most cases of child abuse occur within the family?</p>

<p> I am not disputing that. I think that the hon. Lady is missing the point, which, if I may say so, I do not think she has got her head round. The</p>
<p> point being made is that it is important for a family to support the child. Let us not make judgments about child abuse or the nature of families. It is in the child's best interests to have family support. A family might not give the child very good support, but that is a different issue. Children are generally best brought up by families.</p>
<p> I return to the point that I was making before the hon. Lady's intervention: the state in this country, and I suspect in other countries, has proven that it is not very good at looking after children in the absence of families. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre made some important points about that, to which I hope we shall return in due course. We have a special duty to those children who do not have the support of families. However, where there is a family, we should bear it in mind and give it support. Obviously, my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and I are not calling for support for abusive families or parents, but when a family is caring for a child, we have to consider it and regard family life as important. </p>

<p> Although several amendments have been grouped together, I will separate them to try to make sense of them.</p>
<p> Clearly, involving children in the discharge of the commissioner's function is central to what he is all about. If I have a quarrel with amendment No. 6, tabled my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre, it is that he is trying to prescribe how the commissioner should work. We have left in the words that he wants to delete because we want to leave discretion to the commissioner to decide how best to consult and work with children and take account of their views. </p>

<p> With respect, I cannot follow my right hon. Friend's argument. I am not trying to prescribe how the Children's Commissioner should involve children in the discharge of his function; I am saying just that he should darn well do it. I would have thought that all Committee members could agree on that.</p>

<p> The commissioner will do it, but we need to leave him the flexibility and discretion to do it in the way that is appropriate to him. I am told that the words in clause 2 give him that additional flexibility so that he can operate in the most appropriate manner. It is to enable him to have that flexibility that I ask my hon. Friend not to push amendment No. 54, which would delete the words ''take reasonable steps to''. The purpose of clause 2 is to ensure that the commissioner listens to children and works with them, through them and for them. We share that ambition, and it is on a drafting technicality that we are at odds.</p>

<p> I suppose that, in the accountability structure that we have established, the Secretary of State will ultimately judge whether he fulfils his functions under the terms set out in</p>
<p> schedule 1. The House will also judge. One way that the commissioner will carry out his work is by producing at least one report each year to the House, which will provide an avenue for him to appear before House Committees to answer for the report in any way that hon. Members choose. I have absolutely no doubt that as we watch how the commissioner operates, one issue that we will all examine is how well, broadly and thoroughly he listens to the voice of children and how he reflects that in his work.</p>

<p> I am grateful for that, but the Minister used the phrase ''I suppose that it would be the Secretary of State'', which is not good enough. I cannot envisage any circumstances in which the Children's Commissioner should not or could not involve children in the discharge of his function to ensure that children are made aware of that function. There is no scenario by which children would not be involved in that.</p>
<p> I had thought that we made progress earlier when the Minister was sympathetic and said that she may even return with a Government amendment mirroring my proposal on the role of children in the selection of the Children's Commissioner. It would be entirely consistent and logical to take the four little words out of clause 2, because they do not seem to serve any purpose. </p>

<p> All I would say is that the purpose of including those four words was to provide flexibility to enable the commissioner to function in a practical way. However, if it will help hon. Members, I will reflect on the issue with lawyers again. If we can remove the words without in any way constraining the flexibility of the commissioner to exercise his functions and involve children, we will do so on Report. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to reflect on the issue between now and Report, I will do so.</p>

<p> I am grateful for my right hon. Friend's comments, but I would be even more grateful if she reflected with the Children and Youth Board rather than with lawyers, and asked its members what makes most sense to them: saying that the Children's Commissioner must take reasonable steps to involve children or saying that he must involve them. I really think that she could just accept this amendment.</p>

<p> I hear what my hon. Friend says, but he knows as well as I do that we have to watch the legal terms with which we establish this post. The provision must be copper-bottomed and must make sense and be operable after we have had our debates in Committee and in the House more broadly. However, I will come back to him on that.</p>
<p> The purpose of amendments Nos. 4 and 3 is to extend the duty of the commissioner to take reasonable steps to involve children in the discharge of his functions to all parts of the Bill. The purpose of the existing requirement in respect of the commissioner's clause 2 functions is to ensure that children are involved. We prefer to maintain the current wording, </p>
<p> because the same purpose may not be as relevant to, for example, clause 4 and 5 inquiries. The amendment would serve little purpose in that regard. A clause 5 inquiry would be to investigate the case of an individual child and that child would form the focus of the commissioner's work in any event. I am therefore slightly puzzled as to the extra value that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham thinks would be gained by inserting his wording. </p>
<p> Let us consider the wording in relation to clause 3, which concerns the annual report. Again, I am slightly puzzled as to why children should be involved in the drafting of the commissioner's annual report. Children will want to read it and comment on it and may want to disagree with it, but it is questionable whether it is appropriate to involve them in its drafting. I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's thinking. </p>

<p> I would have thought that it was quite desirable to involve children in the drafting of a report to ensure that it is in a form that they can read and understand.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-10-12_B_02-0_2004-10-12a.6.39" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/965" speakername="Margaret Hodge" time="16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/b/st041012/pm/41012s07.htm" colnum="57">
<p> I do not agree, because the report is the account that the commissioner will give Parliament of the work that he has done, although it will be more widely read. It is a report of his work, which, one hopes, reflects the views of children. Later amendments, which hon. Members have welcomed, talk about the way in which he phrases the report to make it comprehensible to children. The more I think about it, the more I believe that it would be inappropriate to involve children in drafting a report that is the basis of the commissioner's accountability to Parliament and, beyond, to the Secretary of State and others. To conclude, the proposal is unnecessary for clauses 4 and 5 and inappropriate for clause 3.</p>
<p> Let me now turn to the general issues that have been raised in relation to parents. I shall start by saying something that I consider very important: parents are the most important people in a child's life. Anyone who is concerned about children recognises that. Indeed, I often say, and have probably done so in the House, that all the research evidence we have shows that parenting in the home has a greater impact on outcomes for children than any other intervention, including the most wonderful school and the most talented teachers. That is why it is our view, interestingly enough, that for far too long the state has not felt it appropriate to play a role in supporting parents in the most difficult task of rearing their children, and has always left it to the private concern of the family, intervening only when things go wrong&mdash;for example, if a child is subject to abuse. I genuinely believe that there is a wider role for the state in providing&mdash;not forcing&mdash;a framework of support for parents in that difficult task. </p>
<p> If that is common ground with us all, I hope that we can make progress. Several parents' organisations and others approached me at an early stage to say that parents were not incorporated or represented anywhere in the Bill. The reason for that was to avoid our inserting in legislation elements that we do not </p>
<p> need there. We try to keep legislation as narrow and focused as we can. We all recognise the importance of the family, and the crucial importance of parenting to children's outcomes and development, but that does not mean that we need to insert in the Bill a little clause or phrase to pursue that policy objective. However, because of our shared recognition of it, we did insert a phrase on the importance of parenting to children's outcomes at one point in the Bill. I cannot quite recall which clause it is in, but it was an amendment to which we agreed in the House of Lords. </p>
</speech>

<p> I am not sure whether the Minister is referring to clause 7(3), but that refers to the responsibilities of children's services authorities, not to the responsibilities of the commissioner. Where are parents equivalently treated in respect of the commissioner's responsibilities?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-10-12_B_02-0_2004-10-12a.6.41" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/965" speakername="Margaret Hodge" time="16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/b/st041012/pm/41012s07.htm" colnum="58">
<p> The hon. Gentleman is correct: I am indeed referring to that part of the Bill. I was going to come to the issue of the commissioner, because he is correct to say that we have not referred to parents in relation to the commissioner's role and functions. I was going to start to explain why. Clearly, the commissioner will want to have regard to the views of parents and other carers of children when discharging his functions, and he will also have regard to the view that in the vast majority of cases they are the first and best guardians of children's interests. The only cases in which we expect him not to involve parents will be where they are part of the problem, as the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said.</p>
<p> However, we believe that we should leave the commissioner free to consult whomever he thinks appropriate on whatever issue he is considering. Again, that is an essential part of his independence. This is a children's commissioner, not a parents' commissioner. We could argue over whether we should have a parents' commissioner, which might be an interesting expenditure commitment for some political parties as we move into the general election. However, it would not be appropriate in discussing the role of the Children's Commissioner to give any group of people who are important to children and their outcomes precedence over others. That is in no way to undermine the general thrust of our shared understanding of the importance of parents in a child's life. I hope that that explanation will reassure hon. Members that we understand the importance of parents but think that it would be inappropriate to include them in the clause. </p>

<p> Surely the Minister has contradicted herself. She started well, saying that the most important people in the welfare of children are parents, but she ended up saying that we should not give preference in the Bill to any particular group of people. Parents are the most important collection of people by far, so they surely merit a mention that simply says ''must have regard to''. That would not put them in any sort of hierarchy, make their views exclusive or give them a veto, but we should simply include them in the Bill because they do not appear anywhere in this part of it.</p>

<p> They do appear in the Bill, but not in this part of it, because this is about a Children's Commissioner. I made the remarks to which the hon.

<p> But the purpose of the commissioner is to promote, and have regard to, the rights of children. In doing that job, and in implementing the law, he will undoubtedly wish to have regard to a whole group of people of whom parents may well be the most important, but we should not prescribe that. We should not interfere with his independence and put one group of people&mdash;the most important&mdash;in the Bill and not other groups. That is the point I was trying to make.</p>

<p> Again, the Minister is contradicting herself. We are discussing the commissioner, and talking about the rights of children. This morning, she approved an amendment to delete a reference to those rights. We are talking about the most important group of people; we are trying not to hamstring the commissioner but to ensure that the Bill states that those people have a special role, which the Minister herself admitted. Surely they merit just a small mention, a couple of lines in this important part of the Bill, saying that the commissioner should have regard to them.</p>

<p> Despite my best endeavours, we may have to agree to disagree on this point. We recognise the importance of parents and I reiterate that we amended clause 7 to emphasise it, although in terms of the law, we did not need that clause in order to take action, to promote programmes or to give priority to parents, which is the consensus in the Committee. We do not believe that we should mention them in relation to the function of the Children's Commissioner, first, because he is primarily a children's champion, and children's interests should come first&mdash;so we should not prescribe any group except children&mdash;and secondly, because we want to maintain his independence in consulting and having regard to whomever he thinks appropriate in the particular context in which he is working.</p>

<p> Has not my right hon. Friend established that the Children's Commissioner must have regard to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child? Do not articles 5, 10 and 18 of that convention refer to the role and responsibilities of parents to guide their children as they develop, the importance of family reunification and, as article 18 states, the need to support parents in their responsibilities to bring up their own children?</p>

<p> Well, there we are. I am grateful for my hon. Friend's extremely helpful intervention. I simply say that I, and probably other members of the Committee too, cannot imagine being an effective</p>
<p> commissioner without having regard to parents, who are the most important people in a child's life. However, we want the commissioner to remain independent, taking his or her own decisions about whom to consult. That is where we divide.</p>

<p> It would be interesting to know what the Minister and her Children and Youth Board think should be in the job description and the supporting information for those who wish to apply for the post of Children's Commissioner.

<p> As it will be a public appointment, which will be publicly advertised, the job description and specification will be freely available when it emerges. I will be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman as and when it is determined. To be honest, we have not got there yet, as the Bill is not on the statute book. However, we are beginning to think about it, and when the measure is enacted, as I hope it will be in the next few weeks, we shall swiftly move to determine the job description, in consultation with the Children and Youth Board and others, and move towards advertising. If he will bear with me, I shall write and inform him when we decide. It will be a totally public appointment, publicly advertised, so he will no doubt see it in the press and elsewhere, but I undertake to write to him.</p>
<p> I am grateful for the general support that Government amendment No. 169 has received from the Committee. It provides an alternative to the rather difficult text of subsection (3)(c). The Government understand the thinking behind the provision, which was introduced by an amendment in the House of Lords as part of the overhaul of the clause. We agree that reports published by the commissioner should be as child-friendly as possible; after all, the commissioner is acting on behalf of children. </p>
<p> ''Child-friendly'' has a lot of implications, though. It is partly about reflecting the age of children with whom we wish to communicate. It partly reflects issues around disability, and I have had extensive discussions, in particular with Mencap, about how to ensure that many of our communications are understandable to children with a learning disability. When talking about disability, we often think about publishing things in Braille or putting them on tape, but we rarely consider some of the more disadvantaged disabled young children in our communities and their total participation in what we do. </p>
<p> We must also consider language, which was a point raised by the hon. Member for Caernarfon and others. In my constituency, 170 languages are spoken by children in schools at the primary level, and I have no doubt that other members of the Committee are in a similar situation. The phrasing of the amendment leaves it to the discretion and flexibility of the </p>
<p> commissioner so that as he publishes reports in a child-friendly way he can respond to the broad cohort of children with whom he wishes to communicate. </p>
<p> That is the context of the amendment, and it reads better as it is. We wish to leave the discretion to the commissioner so that he can respond to children of different ages, abilities and ethnic backgrounds or with a different language. </p>

<p> I am grateful, Mr. Benton. I am sorry if I should have leapt to my feet with greater alacrity. The ordering of the amendments is so complex that I think we are all struggling slightly.</p>
<p> Having accepted the Minister's reasoning for why there may be problems with amendments Nos. 3 and 4, I am happy not to press them, but I would like to return to the important matter of amendment No. 2&mdash;which I realise is not the lead amendment&mdash;and put it to a vote. The Minister has not made her case and has had to admit that we shall have to divide in our opinions. The Committee should have the opportunity to divide on amendment No. 2, which is fundamental. </p>
<p> The Government have contested the principle, by the addition that they have made to clause 7 in respect of the children's services director. I cannot see why that cannot be an integral consideration, rather than an hierarchical consideration, purely with regard to the group of people that the Minister has admitted is the most important&mdash;not just the parents, but the extended family. It is essential that the Bill should not be unduly prescriptive but should mention the parents and family. I am alarmed that they are not mentioned in part 1 and that they are mentioned rarely in the rest of the Bill. I would therefore be grateful for an opportunity to vote on amendment No. 2. </p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 193, in</p>
<p><span class="indent">clause 2, page 2, line 16, at end insert&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">'(d) Ensure that direct services provided to children by the commissioner or his staff, whether formally or informally is provided in the language of the intended recipients.'.</span></p>
<p> The amendment relates to the Children's Commissioner's duties under the clause, which includes those set out the newly amended subsection (3)(a), which we have just discussed. The amendment draws attention to the language issue&mdash;as hon. Members know by now, I have an interest in the language issue in Wales. </p>
<p> A great deal is wrapped up in the wording of the amendment. The relevant legislation is the Welsh Language Act 1993, which requires public bodies to teach Welsh and English on the basis of equality, in so far as that is reasonably practical and appropriate. That is the injunction of the 1993 Act. Many public bodies do that through the medium of language schemes, which the Welsh Language Board approves. </p>
<p> It is right that the provisions that relate to the commissioner's general functions in dealing with children should deal with language. That would reflect current best practice in Wales, which takes account of the language preferences of the recipients of public services. Not all public services go down that route, but the best do and give primacy to the wishes of the user, client or, in this case, the child. I am sorry to use an old social work expression, but the services start where the client is, rather than where the service is, and with trying to tailor those services to the language wishes of the child. </p>

<p> I have a great deal of sympathy with the points that the hon. Gentleman is making. However, does he not agree that this issue is dealt with under the Welsh Language Act 1993? I understand his desire for the issue to be covered in the Bill, but is it necessary?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-10-12_B_02-0_2004-10-12a.6.61" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1323" speakername="Hywel Williams" time="16:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/b/st041012/pm/41012s08.htm" colnum="62">
<p> I am afraid that, in my experience, very many of these language schemes often refer to the language of answering the telephone or of sending out letters. They refer very infrequently to the language of practice. I have recent experience of a health trust that is quite happy to have signs up in Welsh and in English and to have headed notepaper, but when it comes to discussing the wishes of its elderly patients, it insists that the written material is in English. The problem has been that language schemes vary in their application and in their efficiency in ensuring that the service user has as full a choice as possible. That is why it is important for this to be in this part of the Bill.</p>
<p> I refer briefly to the demography of the matter. Some 600,000 people in Wales speak Welsh, approximately a third of whom are young people. I will not go into the detail of the figures, but one can say </p>
<p> as a general rule that Welsh is getting younger. The conventional picture of Welsh speakers is that they are elderly people living in rural and remote areas. However, the census shows that there is a clear bias in the age group of Welsh speakers towards younger people. That is unsurprising, given changes introduced by the Conservative Government, including the Welsh Language Act 1993, and changes to the national curriculum. Welsh is much more widely taught in schools now and very many more young people speak it, which is a very positive sign. </p>
<p> The point, as the Welsh Language Board has always said, is that public bodies should plan for growth because that is what is happening. As I have said in other debates, the board should plan for a normalisation of the use of Welsh alongside English on a totally equivalent basis. One way of driving that change through would be to give proper regard to the language wishes of service users, which is the aim of the amendment. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman has so far mentioned only Welsh and English. Judging by the way in which he responded to the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), his amendment is designed to cover only those languages, but the amendment itself does not appear to do so. Is he suggesting that the responsibility to ensure that direct services are provided in the language of the intended recipients should apply to the provision of services in any language that is the language of the child concerned?</p>

<p> I refer to clause 2(2), which states that the Children's Commissioner may&mdash;not must&mdash;provide a choice of language. I contend that that would be the normal course of action in Wales. Whether that might be the normal course of action elsewhere is another matter. I point the hon. Gentleman to my earlier argument that the Welsh language has a particular status in Wales and only in Wales, apart from in very peculiar circumstances that I need not go into here. So far as I can see, the amendment would allow the Children's Commissioner to make particular arrangements in Wales in respect of children's language, because of the legal situation.</p>
<p> The other point that I wish to make is that it is best practice to take account of children's language choices. If I had to deal with a child who was very young and could use only the language of his family, whether Italian, Punjabi or whatever, it would be best practice for me to reflect that in the way in which I worked. </p>

<p> My response to that would be that the hon. Gentleman has got me there. However, that was part of my argument; my point was that it would allow the commissioner to work in Wales under this clause. I now see that I have misread it.</p>
<p> I shall finish my remarks so that the Minister can respond to the broad thrust of my argument. The commissioner should have a language scheme in place at the start of the operation of his office. When we discussed this previously, the Minister pointed out that the language scheme of the Children's Commissioner for Wales was approved rather later. The necessity to have the language scheme approved should not prevent the commissioner from applying its principles before it is approved. I would like some reassurance that his work will be consistent with the Welsh Language Act from the start, even if the scheme is not approved until later. </p>
<p> My other point concerned funding, but I think that the Minister answered that in an earlier response. </p>

<p> I shall speak briefly in support of the hon. Member for Caernarfon about the use of the Welsh language in these circumstances. The number of children who are being educated in Welsh is increasing every day, in secondary schools as well as in primary schools. In my constituency, which is broadly English speaking, the demand for a Welsh language education is increasing. For those children, Welsh is the language of home&mdash;their first language&mdash;and the language of education. When they face difficult circumstances, such as emotional problems, or trouble with the way in which services are administered on their behalf, it will be easiest for them to speak the language in which they are used to expressing their problems and their frustrations. I therefore support the spirit of the amendment.</p>
<p> I am not quite sure about the legislation on the requirement for a public body based outside Wales to operate a Welsh language scheme, but it is essential that such a scheme should be in place, not just for administrative purposes such as answering the telephone and dealing with post, but for engaging with children on the matters that are of concern to them, and about which they might find it difficult to express themselves in detail. I support the amendment. </p>

<p> I support the thrust of the amendment. My constituency also has a vast number of children who attend Welsh language schools. There is definitely a need, should they receive any service from the commissioner based in England, for a Welsh language scheme. Every effort should be made to communicate in the language of the home&mdash;the child's</p>
<p> first language. I certainly support the sentiments informing the amendment, and I support what the hon. Member for Caernarfon has said.</p>
<p> I should have thought, however, that the matter was already covered by the Welsh Language Board. I believe that other Departments and organisations which are based in England but whose operations cover Wales, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, provide Welsh language schemes. I am sure that the Minister will be able to enlighten us. </p>

<p> I would support the amendment if it related to clause 2(2) and oppose it if it related to clause 2(3), because the distinction between ''must'' and ''may'' is vital. As the hon. Member for Caernarfon mentioned, it is good practice to take account of the mother tongue of anyone for whom services are being provided, or the language in which they prefer to be addressed. My concern is that the amendment is not confined to Wales or Welsh speakers. [Interruption.]</p>

<p> Thank you, Mr. Benton. Perhaps if I speak more quietly others will too. As the Minister has explained, there are certainly some constituencies in which 170 or perhaps even more languages are spoken. I fear that if the word ''must'' were being used, the amendment would be impossible. That is why my support for the amendment depends entirely on where it goes in the clause.</p>

<p> We are all confused about the issue of ''must'' or ''may''. As I understand it, the amendment is to page 2, line 16, so it would add to subsection (3) a paragraph (d). Therefore, it is a ''must'', not a ''may''. I was previously under the impression that it amended clause 2(2), but it is an addition to clause 2(3). I took it as a probing amendment, and perhaps I may provide comfort to those hon. Members who have expressed an interest.</p>
<p> We are of course aware of our obligations to publish in Welsh where public activities in Wales are involved. I hope that hon. Members will be pleased to hear that we have already initiated inquiries with the Welsh Language Board on methods of implementation. It has advised that it would be for the Assembly to assess the role of the commissioner in Wales, and to decide whether he or she should be required to run a Welsh language scheme. We shall pursue that matter once the Bill has made the necessary progress, but I take the point made by the hon. Member for Caernarfon that we do not need to wait for the establishment of a scheme. </p>
<p> From the point of view of my own constituency I concur with the hon. Member for Isle of Wight: Welsh is but one language, and 170 different mother tongues are spoken by children in my constituency. I wonder whether some of the hon. Members in the Room represent constituencies where even more are spoken. The important thing is that the commissioner should communicate with all children, and we have allowed flexibility precisely so that the commissioner can respond in an appropriate way. Of course, language </p>
<p> can be interpreted in a broad way, which will include the needs of children with learning difficulties. Those needs are also related to language and its use, which is why we have used the broad definition of ''child friendly''. With those brief words of comfort to assert that we are taking the needs of Welsh children seriously, as well as those of children with other languages, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, wherever it sits. </p>

<p> Being a good Calvanistic Methodist, I thank the hon. Member for Isle of Wight for a well-deserved chastening for my earlier mistake. Clearly, I have a surfeit of twos. I see that I have written ''2'' several times here, and not ''3''.</p>
<p> I shall respond briefly to the Minister. I had understood from the Welsh Language Board that there had been some contact following our discussion on the matter in the Welsh Affairs Committee. I am glad that that is the case, and I am very glad to have raised the point and emphasised the importance of language for children, particularly in Wales. Given what I have heard during the debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. </p>
<p> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. </p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 170, in</p>
<p><span class="indent">clause 2, page 2, line 19, at end insert&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent"> '(4A) The Children's Commissioner is not under this section to conduct an investigation of the case of an individual child.'</span></p>
<p> The amendment removes dealing with individual cases from the commissioner's day-to-day role. To reassure Committee members, I can say that the commissioner will still have the discretion in certain circumstances to consider an individual case, such as under subsection (4) where an individual case has wide implications and is not a duplication of an individual case being considered through another mechanism. </p>
<p> I do not believe that any member of the Committee, however they might approach the role of the commissioner and the basis on which the post should be established, would think it achievable for him to take on individual cases throughout England. Neither would it be desirable for him to duplicate the existing ways that cases can be pursued. However, he always ought to consider whether the complaints mechanisms are working appropriately on behalf of children. I hope that hon. Members agree that it is important that everyone understands that such cases are not part of his day-to-day job. </p>

<p> I have some concerns about the amendment. I accept the point that we do not anticipate that the commissioner should investigate every case. I am happy to have a caveat that any such investigation based on an individual case should have wider implications. However, I am not very content with removing that possibility altogether, particularly</p>
<p> at this point at the Bill, and specifically with the wording in subsection (4) that the commissioner should</p>
<p><span class="indent">''have particular regard to groups of children who do not have other adequate means by which they can make their views known.'' </span></p>
<p>That implies some vulnerability to me. Why remove the opportunity entirely? Why not simply have it clearly expressed as it is in the clause that it can only be an individual case with wider implications? I find that much more acceptable than a blanket statement that we would never do something for those vulnerable children. I would be grateful for the Minister's comments on that. </p>

<p> The amendment is there because we wanted to be completely clear about the purpose and functions of the commissioner. I repeat the point from the earlier debate&mdash;I know that the hon. Lady does not agree with me&mdash;that we do not want a rights-based commissioner policing individual rights. We want the commissioner to examine the broader picture and therefore to investigate whether services throughout England and some parts of the other countries of the UK are meeting the needs of children. The amendment will make that absolutely clear.</p>
<p> However, we listened to the debate and to members of the hon. Lady's party in the other House who were very concerned that that would interfere with the commissioner's independence. That is why I urge her to look carefully at subsections (1) and (2) of clause 4, which provide for the independence and the capacity of the commissioner to underpin and investigate individual cases in those very rare circumstances where they will have wider policy implications and where they would not duplicate other existing mechanisms. </p>

<p> It is in the nature of devolution that there will be different ways in which we do our business. That is its strength and joy, and that is why I support it as the hon. Gentleman undoubtedly does himself. When we discuss the Welsh clauses, we will discuss at length how to ensure that there is no confusion for individual children in Wales as to how they proceed. Settlements are different. For example, the Scottish commissioner does not look at individual complaints in the way that the Welsh commissioner does. The Government's view is that with 11.3 million children in England, we do not want the English commissioner to examine individual complaints.</p>
<p> For non-devolved matters, Welsh children will have a series of mechanisms through which they can pursue their individual rights and complaints, as they currently do. My understanding from the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is that the current system </p>
<p> works; children are not perceived as being confused and they are directed to the appropriate mechanism. Under the current system, Welsh children cannot pursue individual complaints through the Welsh commissioner for non-devolved issues. </p>

<p> I thank the Minister. I have no doubt that we will discuss those issues in greater detail. I wish to make the point, however, that surely the importance lies not in how we do our business but in the children and how they can get some recompense and put forward their concerns about their treatment. This legislation puts too much emphasis on the importance of legislation and not enough on the rights of children.</p>

<p> I challenge that. The purpose of setting up the commissioner is to give a strong and powerful voice to children. The way that we are doing that in England is different from the way that the Welsh Assembly has chosen to do it for devolved matters in Wales. That is absolutely fine, and we can all learn from each other. Over time we shall see how effective the different mechanisms are in promoting the interests of children. I am utterly convinced that the mechanism that we propose and the Bill under consideration in Committee will provide an exceedingly powerful and independent champion for children.</p>

<p> I shall speak to the Government amendments, and perhaps deal with the new clauses.</p>
<p> The Government believe that the commissioner's report should, where necessary, lead to action and positive change. There should be agreement across the Committee on that. We do not want to see the reports disappear without trace. Some recommendations made by the commissioner may be unpopular with certain bodies, which is why we have tabled the amendments to provide the commissioner with further powers to follow up the recommendations where appropriate. We do not want to end up, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has suggested, with a commissioner with big ears and no teeth. </p>
<p> Our amendments are phrased as simply as possible, to allow the commissioner flexibility in how he wishes to exercise those powers. We have not laid down an appropriate response time; we will leave that to the discretion of the commissioner. That makes sense because the recommendations made by the commissioner will inevitably be wide ranging and may require different response times. For example, if the commissioner were to recommend that a company selling goods to children should completely change its marketing strategy, three months or even six months might not be long enough to obtain a properly thought-out response. On the other hand, there may be cases where the commissioner feels that a deadline </p>
<p> shorter than three months is appropriate. The important thing is to give the commissioner the freedom to make such decisions as he wishes. </p>
<p> If it is not inappropriate, I want to respond to what I think the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will say in speaking to new clause 1, and to what the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole may say in speaking to new clause 12. I hope that they will compare both new clauses with the Government amendments. Both new clauses would require any body that was the object of a recommendation in a report by the commissioner under clause 4 to respond within three months, failing which the commissioner would publish the fact that it had not done so. They also provide that the same body would have to report again within another month if the commissioner was not satisfied with its initial response. Those responses would be recorded in an open register. I hope that the Committee will understand why I think that such time constraints would be inappropriate for the circumstances. With those assurances, I hope that hon. Members will not insist on pushing the new clauses. </p>

<p> The Minister's comments are helpful. It should be pointed out that we tabled our new clause a month ago; she tabled her amendments five days ago. Some assurance has come from her amendments, which are, uncharacteristically, less wordy than our new clause, which seeks to be all-encompassing, and that is helpful.</p>
<p> We will all agree that the reports need to be acted on, and that there needs to be a clear and transparent line of response so that people can see that action will be taken as a result of any such inquiries. I believe that the response time of three months was suggested by various children's charities. It is not unreasonable for a three-month time scale to be laid down, because that would not be set in stone. If there were reasons why that period was inappropriate&mdash;I accept the point that it could be shorter or longer&mdash;there would be a clear line of action through which a response could be given. </p>
<p> For the purposes of the debate on the clause, and so that we can move things on, I am happy not to take the proposed new clause any further, particularly given its similarity to that tabled by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. However, it would be useful for the Minister to recognise that the new clause is not quite as prescriptive as she suggested. </p>

<p> I welcome the Government's amendments. The intention of my colleagues and I in tabling new clause 12 was to introduce the idea of monitoring into the process, and this was the only place that I could find to do so.</p>
<p> Will the Minister consider further whether there should be a process for monitoring whether action has taken place after a certain period? Although I welcome the amendments, they ask for a statement of intention rather than of what has actually been done. </p>

<p> Our amendments are so clear and precise because they took so long to draft. I apologise to members of the Committee for the fact that they were not given as much notice of the amendments as they would have liked and I would have liked to give them. However, we have some good amendments before us, for which we thank our parliamentary draftsmen.</p>
<p> My response to the question asked by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is that, the moment we include a time frame in the Bill, that becomes the accepted orthodoxy. People then think that they have got three months in which to respond, even if they could actually respond in a shorter time. Equally, if the three-month period is insufficient, there will not be a proper response. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that, and accepts that it would be inappropriate to include such a provision. </p>
<p> Will monitoring take place? It is difficult for me to give assurances on how the commissioner will choose to work. However, I cannot think that he would put energy into producing a report with recommendations and not wish to see them implemented. I hope that the powers that we include in Government amendments Nos. 171 and 177 will give the commissioner the necessary authority to carry out such monitoring; it is therefore unnecessary to include a provision for monitoring in the Bill. I have no doubt that the commissioner will wish to carry out monitoring and to ensure that his recommendations are implemented or, at least, responded to, if there is a good reason why a particular organisation cannot implement them. </p>

<p> Will the Minister give that matter further consideration? My question is intended constructively.
