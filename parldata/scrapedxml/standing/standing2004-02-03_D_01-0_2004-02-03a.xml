<p> Good morning, Mr. Stevenson. I welcome you to the Chair and look forward to working with you and with Mr. Forth, who will replace you in due course. This is an important Bill and we look forward to the detailed discussions that we will have. </p>
<p> I am delighted to see the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham) in his place. Skill, charm and wit are among his attributes and, although I am sure that he will get it wrong in terms of substance, the Programming Sub-Committee has tried to provide ample time to ensure that the Bill is well </p>
<p> scrutinised. I welcome the hon. Gentleman to his place, as I do other Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce). On my own side, I am delighted to have my former colleague in the Whips Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins), alongside me to keep the expert array of talent on the Government Benches in order as we go through the Bill. </p>
<p> I believe that there is ample opportunity to discuss a range of issues. I want to raise the issue of the union modernisation fund, which has hit the press since Second Reading. I assure the Committee that it will have the opportunity, despite what the press reports may say, to discuss the issue in full at the appropriate time. The Government are currently considering the proposals, but they will come before the Committee and I am sure that it will have wise words to say about the fund. We will give the Committee that opportunity. </p>
</speech>

<p> I endorse what the Minister has said in welcoming you, Mr. Stevenson, and your colleague, Mr. Forth, to the Committee. We in the Opposition look forward to working with you.</p>
<p> I am glad that we have agreed some alterations to the programme motion. Initially, we took the view that there was no need for a programme motion on the Bill. As the Minister has pointed out, it is an important Bill but not one that will involve our getting into long detailed arguments. I have said all along that we will be constructive and positive about many parts of the Bill, but will want to concentrate on one or two specific clauses. </p>
<p> I regret the principle of the programme motion, but I want to thank the Minister and the Government Whip for their flexibility in allowing us a little more time for discussion of part 1. There are quite a few amendments on part 1, and I am sure that Government Members will want to make various comments. The Minister mentioned the union consolidation fund. It is regrettable that the Bill is already being used as an opportunity to add a variety of new amendments. Although we find that regrettable, we will obviously await the substance and details and return to the matter in due course. However, we are content with the programme motion as it stands. </p>

<p> I support the hon. Gentleman's remarks, and thank the Minister and the Government Whip for their courtesy in allowing consultation on the programme motion. It is both my personal view from experience and my party's view that an agreed programme that allows a Bill to be properly debated is far preferable to an elastic programme that has to be curtailed, leaving significant provisions undebated or undetermined.</p>
<p> We as a party broadly support the Bill; the Conservative Opposition's position is rather different. However, we would like to debate one or two issues and we will also be tabling amendments. I hope that we have the balance and the spirit right. We are here to do </p>
<p> a job of work and to debate the issues objectively and tirelessly. The consultation that has taken place in advance has been constructive. </p>
<p> Question put and agreed to. </p>

<p> I now move to a short announcement on Committee arrangements. Adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendment that might be reached during an afternoon sitting. I hope that all Committee members understand that as I do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-02-03_D_01-0_2004-02-03a.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/726" speakername="Henry Bellingham" time="9:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/d/st040203/am/40203s01.htm" colnum="5">
<p> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in</p>
<p><span class="indent">clause 4, page 4, line 5, leave out 'compatible with' and insert 'conducive to'.</span></p>
<p> ''Appropriate bargaining unit'' in the title of the clause refers to the unit of employees within a firm or group of companies that forms the bargaining unit for the purposes of the legislation. Our reason for wishing to substitute the words ''conducive to'' for ''compatible with'' is simple. Compatibility with effective management is too passive a formulation and ''conducive to'' is more positive. If we consider the role of management in the business and its right to create wealth, for the purposes of what the Central Arbitration Committee must take into account, the words ''conducive to'' are stronger and clearer than the words ''compatible with''. That is the essence of the amendment. </p>

<p> Is it not a problem that the word ''conducive'' is subjective and therefore likely to lead to all sorts of disagreements, whereas ''compatible'' is objective and therefore easier to understand?</p>
</speech>

<p> I do not necessarily accept that; it is a debating point. However, I accept that our amendment would make it slightly fairer to management when it came to sorting out one small aspect of the equation. We are suggesting a change to a point of detail in a part of the Bill that is concerned with how the management structure in a particular company is able to run the business.</p>
<p> Let me also touch on amendment No. 16, which is grouped with&mdash; </p>

<p> In getting down to the nitty-gritty of the Bill, I have found it one of the harder ones to contend with, because only two of its clauses are stand-alone provisions. Otherwise, it relates to other legislation&mdash;the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act</p>
<p> 1992, the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Employment Relations Act 1999, the minimum wage legislation and so forth&mdash;and it is impossible to consider the Bill without referring to that legislation.</p>
<p> I was struck by the fact that there have been some 25 pieces of pro-union legislation, and this adds to them. The clause and part 1 make more changes, invariably in favour of the unions. I should like to ask the Minister about a matter that comes up throughout the Bill. I would appreciate it if we could address it in the early stages, rather than have it as an ongoing issue. Where did the proposals, including that dealt with in amendment No. 1, come from? Did the Government carry out a review of the changes that would be necessary to existing legislation, or did they ask the unions&mdash; </p>

<p> Order. I am a little worried that this is becoming a Second Reading debate or perhaps a clause stand part debate. Will the hon. Gentleman refer to the specific wording of the amendment?</p>

<p> I thank you, Mr. Stevenson, for your comments, which I respect, but this is an important issue, which will come up throughout our proceedings, so I thought that it might be appropriate&mdash;</p>

<p> Order. I respect what the hon. Gentleman says, and I shall try to reflect that in my comments, but I really would like him to get back to the amendment.</p>

<p> I shall, although I hope that the Minister has taken my point on board.</p>
<p> Clause 4 relates to the appropriate bargaining unit in cases where the parties have failed to reach agreement. I support amendment No. 1. Management's primary concern is the effective running of the company. It must be allowed to manage the units of labour, and that goes to the heart of the problem with much of the legislation, which is stultifying and ties down the units of labour. That makes management harder than it should be, by working against the adaptable allocation of labour. Perhaps the question that was posed earlier could be turned round, and the Minister could give examples of what compatibility means in this context. </p>

<p> I thank the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk for moving the amendment in the spirit in which he did. The backdrop to the Bill is the 1999 Act; indeed, the Bill is a response to the way in which the Act is working. We said that we would review the Act after three years, and have done so. The review is an important document, and I suggest that those who want to contribute to the debate read it and take note of the consultation that we held to seek clarification on the many issues before us.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-02-03_D_01-0_2004-02-03a.4.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/854" speakername="Jonathan Djanogly" time="9:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/d/st040203/am/40203s02.htm" colnum="6">
<p> This is an early point at which to raise the issue, and I appreciate the Minister spending time on it, but can he explain where the impetus for the changes came from during the consultation? Very few, if any, of the changes in the Bill favour companies.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-02-03_D_01-0_2004-02-03a.4.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1263" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" time="9:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/d/st040203/am/40203s02.htm" colnum="7">
<p> If the hon. Gentleman reads the consultation document and sees how different organisations responded, he will find that there was a fair balance as regards the way in which the previous legislation was working. We need to clarify certain issues, so that it works even better.</p>
<p> Clause 4 deals with the way in which the Central Arbitration Committee reaches decisions on bargaining units. Determining the bargaining unit is, of course, a key stage in the statutory procedure, and the union and the employer are usually very interested in making their views on the issue known to the CAC. </p>
<p> The existing statutory procedure sets out a list of criteria that the CAC must take into account when assessing the appropriateness of bargaining units. Those criteria are set out again in new paragraphs 19B(2) and (3), and the description of them has not changed in any way. The need for bargaining units </p>
<p><span class="indent">''to be compatible with effective management'' </span></p>
<p>is the most important of those criteria, and the others come into play only to the extent that they do not conflict with it. </p>
<p> We have been very encouraged by the way in which this part of the statutory procedure has worked in practice, and the CAC and the parties have found it to be workable and fair. Importantly, decisions about bargaining units have been taken quite quickly. The process has rarely led to significant delays, which is a great achievement, given the issue's potential complexity. </p>
<p> There is no need to make significant changes to this part of the statutory procedure&mdash;that was one of the findings of our review of the 1999 Act. Clause 4 merely sets out in greater detail, and in the interests of clarity, the processes that the CAC must follow when determining bargaining units&mdash;it does not change those processes. </p>
<p> The amendment would make a much more radical change by altering the wording of the key ''effective management'' criterion. That criterion already has a predominant position, and the amendment would elevate its status further. That is clearly the motivation of the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk. We see no reason why the balance should be changed; the statutory procedure has worked very well. The carefully crafted formula lists the main criteria, respects the genuine interests of the employer, and ensures that bargaining units respect the need for effective management. If the union's proposed bargaining unit were to undermine effective management, it should be replaced by one that is compatible. </p>
<p> I understand why the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk tabled the amendment, but I do not think that it would be right to change things at this stage. I hope that he will reflect on the matter, as the system works well. There is no case for the amendment. It would create an imbalance in key parts of the procedure and would produce uncertain effects. Therefore, I ask him to withdraw it.</p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I do not entirely agree with it, but he has put forward a reasonably convincing case. We would like to return to this point either on Report or when the Bill goes to another place. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:</p>

<p> Amendment No. 17 is consequential to amendment No. 16, so there is no need to discuss it in any detail. Amendment No. 16 goes to the core of individual choice and the freedom of employees to do what they feel is right for them when a certain number of them do not particularly want to be represented by a union.</p>
<p> It is important to consider the background. For a trade union's application to the CAC to succeed, 10 per cent. of employees in the bargaining unit must be members and the CAC must be satisfied that the majority of employees are likely to favour recognition. If there is a ballot, there needs to be a majority of those who vote, plus 40 per cent. of those entitled to vote. That is straightforward. The amendment would mean that, once recognition had been established, if 25 per cent. of employees did not wish to be represented by the union, they should retain the right to negotiate separately. That goes to the core of the rights of individuals in a company. </p>
<p> The essence of any successful business is to have a happy, cordial relationship between managers, employers and employees. My experience of business&mdash;before I returned to this House, I had substantial experience of business&mdash;is that the relationship between management and employees is vital. Keeping people happy, motivated, absorbed and involved is vital to the conduct of a business. If a company has a hard core of employees who are not satisfied with the situation, and who wish not to be represented by that union, it would be in everyone's interests&mdash; </p>

<p> What the hon. Gentleman suggests would be a managerial nightmare.

<p> I support my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk. It would be beneficial to introduce that right for a certain percentage of workers.

<p> No, I will continue on my course. An individual has the right to be a member of a union. That does not stop. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Lyons) spoke about a shower of bargaining units. However, what the amendment suggests already applies in most of the private sector. Individuals negotiate their terms with their employers. To say that business will come to grief and collapse because the company and the unions do not get together and wrap things up for everyone is a non sequitur.</p>

<p> I presume that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting not that individuals should have an individual negotiating right, but that they should have a collective right if 25 per cent. determine it, thus, in effect, creating alternative bargaining units in a single organisation.</p>

<p> I am, indeed, suggesting that. Individuals should have the right to get together to maintain a bargaining position, whether or not they are represented by a union. Indeed, existing legislation gives them such a right. A company that is about to merge and has to consult its employees must help them to put together a form of bargaining unit if there is no trade union. I have a problem not with that, but with individuals being forced into collective bargaining against their will&mdash;a separate issue.</p>
<p> What Government Members are talking about is the old fashioned, get-back-to- the-1950s wrap-up, with management and the unions sorting things out together. I am not saying that that will not work in certain circumstances, especially in the larger, perhaps older industries. Circumstances are different. I maintain, however, that individual rights should be taken on board. This legislation ignores individual rights. </p>

<p> If we are protecting individual rights, and if an individual has the right not to belong to a trade union&mdash;a right that we support&mdash;surely that endorses the fact that the individual right exists.

Gentleman believe that 25 per cent. or more would set up individual bargaining, and that that would be the best way for the employer to deal with an issue?</p>

<p> The problem that we will have in the debate is that many Government Members, as my hon.

Most employ a few dozen people.</p>

<p> The reality is that the people of this country do not realise what rights have been given back to the unions. If they did&mdash;I hope they will&mdash;they would react against it. I thank my hon. Friend for reiterating that fact.</p>
<p> We maintain that people have individual rights within the collective bargaining regime that the Government are so keen to maintain and to build upon. The question is: at what point should individuals have the right to be heard? The suggested figure of 25 per cent. may be too high. It was included as a conciliatory figure in order to create a balance, but it can be debated. I ask the Government to consider it, because we live in a different age from that being dealt with by the Bill. </p>

<p> As I see it, the Government seek to maintain the present position, which is that individual rights are wholly maintained for those who do not wish to be part of the collective bargaining unit. People have the absolute right not to be part of the union. It may</p>
<p> be extremely unwise to take that view, but it is a matter of conscience; it is a personal choice. The law is well established, and no change is intended under the Bill.</p>

<p> People certainly do not have the right to change the collective bargaining arrangements. The individual contract is a matter for negotiation, but it cannot be contrary to or in opposition to the collective rights that have been negotiated. However, the amendment, with its threshold of 25 per cent., would result in the most dangerous outcome. Even if the union&mdash;the majority&mdash;has decided on a different course of action, the 25 per cent. could thwart the rights of the majority. In a democracy, the majority should not impose on the rights of the individual, but the majority should none the less have their way. That is what the Bill provides. To impose a 25 per cent. threshold to effective alternative bargaining would not only cause chaos but be unfair.</p>

<p> I oppose the amendment. If only with its rhetoric, the Conservative party seems to be looking back to the dear, dead days of the 1960s. Conservative Members appear to want to reintroduce the potential to be confrontational and divisive. I am trying to imagine a possible scenario. A bargaining situation has been established, to which the majority of workers have agreed, but a substantial minority then say that they want to negotiate different arrangements. The idea that those workers will happily go on working side by side in the same environment with two different bargaining arrangements is nonsense. I cannot imagine that any responsible or sensible employer would regard that as conducive&mdash;the word used in amendment No. 1&mdash;to good management or good industrial relations.</p>
<p> I take the point made by the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) that the structure of the labour market has changed radically over the past 20 to 30 years, and that as a result union membership declined and is only just beginning to recover. Indeed, smaller work places operate with a different dynamic. Later in the Bill, we shall be trying to define an appropriate size. In that context, the amendment seems inappropriate. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman talks as though everyone is happily involved in unions, that all companies talk happily with the unions and that what we propose is regressive. I hasten to remind him that only a tiny minority of people in the private sector are members of unions. The Bill is about enabling the unions to get in and represent the workers.</p>

<p> The Bill is about the giving the unions the right to get in and represent workers, but it does not impose on workers the obligation to join a</p>
<p> union. I have been in the House for just over 20 years, and I voted for most of the Conservative reforms in the 1980s because they democratised unions that had become over-powerful and which abused their power. I would not support the Bill if I thought that it reversed the beneficial effects of those reforms. However, I believe that it is a genuine attempt to tidy things up and to get the balance right.</p>
<p> Conservative Members should consider carefully whether their approach suggests a party with a genuine interest in good, constructive industrial relations or one that is trying to load the dice so that bad management&mdash;we know that there are bad managers&mdash;can exploit a work force who have no effective power. We are trying to ensure that responsible managements and responsible unions&mdash;as well as individuals who do not want to be part of their arrangements&mdash;can operate peacefully and constructively, but the amendment would help to achieve that. </p>

<p> I am grateful to those who have spoken. Labour Members and the hon. Member for Gordon outlined the objections to the amendments; these objections go to the root of our attempts to achieve a good balance in industrial relations. The context is that the world is changing in terms of demographics, organisation and the challenge of global competition and we need modern, effective and high-productivity workplaces.</p>
<p> We must ask who is living in a time warp. Industrial relations today are a matter of ensuring that people work together as productively as possible, that there is no exploitation and that businesses do well, but the amendments show a fundamental distrust of that way forward. The Government have technical concerns with the construction of the amendments. Leaving that aside, the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) dismissed the point about what would happen with de-recognition to people who wanted to stay in a recognised union. </p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in</p>
<p><span class="indent">clause 3, page 2, line 31, leave out '5' and insert '10'.</span></p>
<p> This is a simple amendment, which relates to an earlier point in the Bill. As so often happens, we are debating legislation in a logical but not strictly chronological order. The clause deals with the employer's duty to supply information to the union, and I am looking forward to discussing some important amendments to it in a moment. Amendment No. 14, however, is fairly short. Page 2, line 31, of the Bill states: </p>
<p><span class="indent"> ''Within 5 working days starting with the day after that on which the CAC gives the employer notice of acceptance of the application, the employer must supply the following information''. </span></p>
<p>Five days is not long enough. Consider the information that has to be produced; a list of the categories of worker in the proposed bargaining unit, a list of the workplaces and the number of workers that the employer reasonably believes to be in each category at each workplace. It will be easy for a company that operates on one site&mdash;perhaps a small manufacturing unit employing 30, 40 or 50 people&mdash;to supply that information. </p>
<p> However, there are many disparate industries in this country. Sectors such as haulage, which have depots around the country at which some employees are self-employed and the use of sub-contractors is prevalent, will find it much harder to pull the information together. In addition, some companies keep very good records, but others are less conscientious. I am in favour of anything that drives up business efficiency standards, but we must also have an eye on what is reasonable. Five working days is not long enough. In the circumstances that I have described, 10 working days would be more reasonable. That is why I have tabled the amendment. </p>

<p> After the union has applied to the CAC for recognition, the next stage of the process is for the CAC to determine the role of the bargaining unit. The clause imposes on the employer a duty to supply information, including a list of categories of worker, a list of workplaces and the numbers of workers in each category to the unions and the CAC. I support my hon. Friend; the time in which the employer must provide that information should be extended from five to 10 working days, starting with the day after that on which the CAC gives the employer notice. That obligation could put a considerable strain on the employer, depending on the size of the business in question. That touches on another issue that arises throughout the legislation. The Bill takes a one-size-fits-all approach. In other words, it does not account differently for the size of the company, so whether it is ICI&mdash;</p>

<p> I am, indeed, aware, and I am coming to that very point. It is still the case that a bike shop employing more than 21 people will be subject to the same regulations as will ICI. That is a fundamental flaw in the Bill.</p>
<p> Having said that, I come back to the Minister's point, which is key. The CAC annual report notes that 54 per cent. of bargaining units have fewer than 100 staff, but it does not give any figures lower than that. There is a deficit of information in the public arena. If the figures are available, I should be grateful if the Minister said so. I do not know whether he has the information to hand now, but it would be helpful for the Committee if he said how many bargaining units there were with 21 to 25 workers, 25 to 30, 30 to 50, 50 to 75 and 75 to 100. If we had that information, we would be better able to understand the implications of the Bill for companies of different sizes. I have a feeling that the statistics will show that smaller companies are having a tougher time than large ones. </p>

<p> Notwithstanding what the hon. Gentleman says about the figures, I shall try to get that breakdown for him. I do not know how long it will take. The amendment seems to extend from five to 10 working days the period within which the employer must supply information to the CAC and the union about the proposed bargaining units. The duty to supply this information is very important. It applies during the special 20-day period set aside in the process for the parties to try to reach a voluntary agreement between themselves on an appropriate bargaining unit. This negotiation period can be extended if necessary. The CAC steps in to decide the unit only if the parties fail to agree. That arrangement has worked very well; better, perhaps, than many people expected.</p>
<p> By the end of December last year, 79 bargaining units had been decided by agreement between the parties. That left only 73 cases in which the CAC had to determine the unit. We want to build on that success by easing the way for even more agreements to be reached. The clause achieves this by ensuring that all the parties share helpful information early in negotiation. The sooner a shared understanding of the shape of the work force can be achieved, the greater the chance that an appropriate bargaining unit will be agreed. </p>
<p> The clause introduces a duty on employers to supply the union with information on the number of workers in the union's proposed bargaining unit by category of worker and by workplace. The occupational and geographical compositions of the work force are usually key factors in determining bargaining units. The union cannot know this detail in advance of lodging its application. A level playing field is created in negotiations if the employer discloses that information. This will facilitate more constructive negotiations and more informed choices. </p>
<p> The amendment would allow an employer to delay negotiations by waiting until halfway through the initial 20-day negotiation period before supplying the information. That is too long. Five working days is a reasonable amount of time in which to expect the employer to supply the information. The information </p>
<p> required is restricted to basic employment data, and most employers should already have compiled it for other business purposes as a matter of course. Indeed, in many cases, the employer will have supplied much of the data to the CAC at the earlier admissibility stage, so the task will not be excessively time-consuming. Moreover, employers going through the process will know in advance what the procedure requires of them. This requirement will not be sprung on them suddenly. Employers will have plenty of time before they reach the bargaining unit negotiation stage to prepare the information. </p>
<p> The Government cannot support the amendment, as the clause does not place unreasonable demands on the employer. I have figures that I will share with members of the Committee. They are too difficult to discuss now, but I will ensure that hon. Members have the detail of the bargaining units by this afternoon's sitting. I ask the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk to withdraw the amendment. </p>

<p> Will the Minister say what happens if the company cannot access information within the specified period? There will be exceptional circumstances.

<p> As I said, the company will know what procedures are expected of it by the time it enters into negotiations. There will have been an attempt to try to reach a voluntary arrangement. The company will know that the statutory procedure will be developed and that the information will be required. The hon. Gentleman does, however, raise an interesting point about small failures or slight administrational hiccups, which we will discuss later.

<p> The Clerks have grouped the amendment with amendment No. 20, which relates to clause 5, and with amendment No. 30, which relates to clause 12. They are all worded identically and have the same raison d'etre, which is why they have been grouped together.</p>
<p> There are a number of issues that arise from the amendment, such as commercial confidentiality and the security of the employer and employees. Although we probably feel least strongly about commercial confidentiality, it could be significant. My hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon has a lot of experience of corporate takeovers and corporate reconstructions from work in his previous incarnation as a partner in a firm of city solicitors. We respect his experience. He knows that there are times when commercial confidentiality is vital; in a takeover, for example, intellectual property or patents could be an issue. The company in question might be trying to register patents or intellectual property at a particularly critical time. Commercial confidentiality is vital in those circumstances. </p>
<p> Business today can also get pretty ruthless and determined at times, such as during a bust-up in a boardroom or a company. I am sure that members of the Committee have been following the story in the press recently about the row between the managing director of Manchester United and the senior shareholders John Magnier, J. P. McManus and Dermot Desmond. Those individuals have employed a firm called Kroll, an aggressive and ruthless security company, to delve into every aspect of Sir Alex Ferguson's business activities and private life. That is an example of the lengths to which people will go to get information when there is a serious boardroom bust-up. That is the background in business now. Tactics can be used that are different to those used in the past. </p>

<p> I will come to that. Ruthless tactics can be employed to obtain information in today's business world, so there will be times when a company wants to protect its commercial confidentiality. If companies must supply information to the CAC, there will be one more organisation with highly sensitive commercial information.</p>

<p> Can the hon. Gentleman give an example? The information that companies are required to supply under the provisions is pretty limited. What situation does the hon. Gentleman</p>
<p> envisage&mdash;within the limitations of the list&mdash;that might involve confidential information liable to cause such embarrassment?</p>
</speech>

<p> It might be that the company in question is opening a new plant somewhere. The company might be working on a new patent or putting together a new group of employees to move into a plant. One could think of a number of examples. However, I would accept entirely that commercial confidentiality is probably the weaker of our two points.</p>
<p> We should consider the security of employees carefully. Employee security, which can involve giving up the details of home address, for instance, is usually not a critical factor. In most companies involved in manufacturing, engineering, the service industry, distribution, warehousing or logistics&mdash;we can all think of examples from our constituencies&mdash;the employees are probably quite relaxed about people knowing their home addresses and other such personal details. However, the work of other companies is much more controversial. One thinks of companies involved in the arms trade or the export of systems that could be used to repress human rights. In particular, employees of some companies that are involved in animal experimentation have been subject to the most appalling attacks. One thinks of Huntingdon Life Sciences, and I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon is up to speed with that. </p>
<p> I have been robust in trying to reduce the level of animal experimentation in this country, and I have always been keen on animal welfare, but the experiments being done by HLS will advance the world of medical knowledge. However, we have seen appalling tactics being used to intimidate, bully and frighten that company's employees. Flowing from that was the recent announcement by Cambridge university that its proposed primate research centre would not be going ahead for exactly those reasons; it was worried about the security of employees. </p>
<p> Although we feel strongly about the matter, it is a probing amendment to flag up the fact that, in some circumstances, the security of employees should be considered. I do not know whether the amendment is the right way to achieve it, but the Minister is the expert and he has a team of experts advising him. I am sorry that our friend on the Liberal Democrat Benches is not here, because I think he would be interested in this debate. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman's nostalgia seems to have taken him back to the days of GCHQ, when the Conservative Government saw the trade unions as a threat from within. Can he identify at least one example of a trade union or of individual members of a trade union having been given information that has damaged the employer?</p>

<p> I do not for one moment believe that trade unions or other organisations connected with them would want to do anything to risk the security of employees. The information has to be sent not to trade unionists but to the CAC. I am not talking</p>
<p> about unions; I am talking about information being forwarded to the committee. That information may be sent by e-mail or by other methods, but the employees may be uneasy about disclosing such information to another body.</p>
<p> It is a probing amendment; we do not say that the wording is 100 per cent. correct. However, we are living in a world of global demonstrations and of individuals and single-issue pressure groups with substantial resources and commitment. Some of their members have unfortunately moved beyond the pale; from what we believe to be acceptable demonstrations to tactics against individuals that are completely unacceptable. </p>
<p> We are concerned that anything that might enable others to gain information about individuals and security arrangements could be a step in the wrong direction, unless it is properly protected. That is all that we seek. </p>

<p> I see this as a wrecking amendment. I can understand the proposition put by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, but the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are about providing information to the CAC. If we accepted the amendment, the employer would be able to refuse to give that information, and the CAC would not be able to appeal against the decision. That would wreck the whole concept of this part of the Bill.</p>
<p> My view is that we have to move forward. I believe that all parties should embrace consensus within the workplace, but amendments such as this would risk destroying any opportunity of employers and trade unions working together. I would ask the hon. Gentleman to look seriously at the proposition. </p>

<p> The amendments relate to the confidentiality of information, each under slightly different circumstances. The selection of the amendments means that we are considering amendments to clauses 3, 5, and 12. As the confidentiality provisions would be different in each clause, I will have to stray into clause 5, in particular; I hope that that will not be a problem.</p>
<p> Employers must be given the right to withhold information on the grounds that it is commercially confidential, or that its release may affect the security of employees or the company. In relation to clause 3, we need to appreciate that unions will not have been recognised at that stage; they will not have held a ballot or decided whether there is a viable bargaining unit. The unions' position at that point is detached from the status that many hon. Members have attributed to them during our discussions, for example that they will </p>
<p> be in place and part of the team. That is not the situation that is envisaged at the point at which clause 3 will apply. </p>
<p> I am not entirely sure why information on categories of worker and numbers of employees in each place of work needs to go to the unions at all. Perhaps the Minister can explain that. I think that it was intimated that such information does not need to go to the unions and the CAC, but clause 3 says that it does. I agree with other people's assumptions. I am not sure why it needs to go to the unions at that stage; it could go just to the CAC, which will run the process. </p>
<p> I return to my point about confidential information. We live in a corporate world in which information is king, not that it ever wasn't. Information is much more accessible in this age of computers. The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye asked for an example in which the amendment would be relevant. The fact that companies do not need to disclose divisional strengths in their accounts is a good example; knowing the divisional strength of a company could be a competitive advantage for a competing company. Under the Bill, that information will need to be disclosed to the CAC. </p>
<p> Companies will be concerned about the release of such information to the CAC and the unions. I reiterate that, at that stage, the unions will not be on board, but will be outside parties with members in other companies in the same sector. Although the unions may not give information to competing companies, it may get to them through union members. I say that as an attack, not on unions, but on competing companies that would use it as a way of getting information on other companies in the same sector. I hasten to add that I am no expert on the law in this area, but I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether the unions would have a legal duty to keep confidential any information that they receive under the measures. What comeback would there be if such information got out to a competing company? Is it possible, within existing law, for the unions to guarantee to companies that the information that they receive will not go any further or be used for any purpose other than that for which the Bill provides? </p>

<p> If I understand the comments made by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, the hon. Member for Huntingdon has vast experience of asset-stripping. He talks about ''the union'' in abstract terms. The union consists of the members and whether employees are members of a union or not, they can still pass on information that could be classed as highly confidential. On the principle of confidential clauses, does he accept that the Government have the right to say, whenever they feel like it, that they cannot disclose information because it is confidential? Would his party accept that?</p>

<p> Ignoring the hon. Gentleman's views on my previous work experience, I will say that he makes my point. The unions are not stand-alone</p>
<p> entities existing in law, although they are. They are also human beings and people who talk to each other and communicate and who will want to discuss an approach and a strategy. That will involve confidential information. That is why I am so concerned that the concept of confidentiality should be recognised and why we propose the amendment.</p>
<p> I want to go on to clause 5. Although the request is the same&mdash;that we provide for commercial confidentiality and security&mdash;in this particular situation we are talking about giving personal details such as names and home addresses to the CAC. That is a wider remit than under clause 3. Not only is it a wider remit, it is a more personal remit because personal information, particularly about people's homes and addresses, will go through. </p>
<p> Why should we be so concerned to protect information about people's homes and addresses? As my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk mentioned, I have a company in my constituency called Huntingdon Life Sciences. The Minister has probably heard the name of that company several times in the past&mdash;probably several times in the past week&mdash;and that company has a very significant problem. </p>
<p> Groups of people&mdash;I refer to them as terrorists&mdash;do everything that they can to find out the names and addresses of people who work for that company. Once they have the names and addresses they publish them on their website. That is apparently done quite legally; I hope that the Minister will address that issue and I have written to members of the Government about it. Those people then leave it to an assorted group of thugs and terrorists to go round and terrorise the homes of those whose addresses have been published. We are talking about some pretty terrible actions; from death threats, daubings and smashed windows to walking down the individual's street, knocking on every neighbour's door and telling them that a murderer lives three doors down. All that comes from the fact that the name and address of the individual escaped in to the public sector. That is why I am extremely concerned about the confidentiality of names and addresses. </p>
<p> We are talking about times when the union is not yet on board; times when although individuals may be members of the union, the union has not been accepted for the purposes of collective bargaining rights. However, under clause 5 the CAC will receive all such personal information. I am sure that the CAC has good confidentiality arrangements; it would be helpful if the Minister explained to the Committee what those are. That would certainly allay some of my concerns. </p>
<p> As clause 5 stands, the wording is not tight enough. Paragraph 19D(1) states that an employer revealing his employees' names and addresses to the CAC must do so only </p>
<p><span class="indent">''so far as it is reasonable to expect him to do so''. </span></p>
<p>The Minister might argue that that addresses the point about confidentiality. However, the idea needs to be developed. The Minister needs to explain what the reasonableness would involve. Would it be enough for a company to refuse to give the names and addresses </p>
<p> of its employees if, for instance, it was the focus of a known terrorist threat, as is Huntingdon Life Sciences? This is an important point, and I am happy to support the amendment. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2004-02-03_D_01-0_2004-02-03a.6.24" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/760" speakername="Malcolm Bruce" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmstand/d/st040203/am/40203s05.htm" colnum="21">
<p> The amendment relates to two different issues that need to be treated separately. I have grave suspicions about commercial confidentiality, which is used as a catch-all excuse for not providing information. Governments also use it, and I would not want to build it into the Bill. Hon. Members have, however, raised legitimate concerns about confidentiality in relation to security. Whether that justifies an amendment is another matter. I deplore the fact that the sort of research carried out by Huntingdon Life Sciences has been driven out of this country and that many people who work in this field have been put under pressure. I also wonder how many public campaigners who oppose Huntingdon Life Sciences, even if they do not support the terrorism, would be willing to refuse treatment for their dying child if such research had produced a cure. That is the question that people must ask themselves.</p>
<p> The real point of the amendment is to say that we should interfere with the process of allowing unions to organise themselves legitimately because of a terrorist threat or a threat of violence against a business. It also slightly impugns trade unions to suggest that they would not be as concerned about the security of their members as the management would be. I do not dispute the points made by the hon. Gentlemen, but if they have a legitimate concern, the amendment needs to be more tightly drafted. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman very quickly moved away from the point about commercial sensitivity. His rationale, as I understood it, was that reference to commercial sensitivity could be a catch-all, and he dismissed it as a way forward.

<p> I would want to be more persuaded of the circumstances to be convinced that that was desirable. However, I suspect that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that the wording of the amendment does not stand up legally because it does not say who decides whether a situation is commercially sensitive, or it implies that the employer decides. There is no appeal or external reference. Conservative Members must concede that the amendment is not drafted tightly enough, even if one accepts the thrust of the argument. I maintain my suspicion of referring to commercial confidentiality in this context, and view it simply as a means of trying to block a process that would otherwise be acceptable.</p>
<p> The point about security may have legitimacy, but it would have to be defined much more tightly. Any of us would be appalled if we believed that information obtained in the process was misused in a way that put anyone's safety or security at risk. Huntingdon Life Sciences is a case in point, but there is no evidence to suggest that trade unions are the source of the information. There are many other ways in which people can find out who works where if they want to </p>
<p> get at them. In a free and open society, that is extremely difficult to prevent. Even then, I would need to be given a much more precise example of the sort of situation in which such a threat might occur. Some sort of external body might be able to judge whether reference to commercially sensitivity was appropriate, but I am not yet convinced that such cases are sufficiently frequent to matter. </p>

<p> This has been a useful debate although, unfortunately, some of the issues raised are not relevant to the Bill. On the subject of Huntingdon Life Sciences, I agree with the hon. Member for Gordon about the activities of the people involved. The Government's position has been very clear, and I acknowledge the work done by the hon. Member for Huntingdon on behalf of his constituents to try to deal with an horrendous situation. I am not sure whether he has written to me, but I will ensure that ministerial colleagues respond in due course. However, that is outside the context of the debate.</p>
<p> As I think the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk acknowledges, the amendments are not technically proficient. On that basis, I hope that he will not press them, but let us go through some of the issues that they raise. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for Huntingdon asked why the union should get the information. The reason is that it must propose the bargaining unit to the CAC, which must then determine, in discussions with the employer, whether the unit is appropriate. I do not think that that a trade union would act in a way that damaged its credibility or its membership. Furthermore, the relationship between companies and unions is covered by data protection laws and, where necessary, confidentiality arrangements. </p>
<p> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan) that the amendments could be seen as wrecking amendments in the context of the statutory recognition procedure. None the less, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk raised issues about the Government's attitude, and we take seriously our responsibility to ensure that commercial confidentiality is protected. I hope to explain the issue to him. </p>
<p> As has been explained, all three amendments refer to different clauses, but it is appropriate that we take them together. Amendment No. 15 seeks to protect the employer's right not to disclose to the union and the CAC information that is commercially sensitive or which might affect its security and that of its employees. That would apply where the employer had to provide information about the numbers, categories and locations of workers in the bargaining unit, and we discussed those issues in relation to amendment No. 14. I am sure that the intentions behind it are admirable, but let me reassure hon. Members that clause 3 will not require the employer to provide information that is any more sensitive than that which most companies are already perfectly content to publish in their annual reports.</p>

<p> That is exactly my point; the information is not required to be published in the annual report.</p>

<p> We must agree to differ on that point.</p>
<p> Clause 3 is not part of an underhand plot to allow unions to gain insider information about an employer. It applies only to the union's proposed bargaining unit and only once the union's application has passed the admissibility tests. Its purpose is to facilitate more constructive negotiations and more informed choices during the period of negotiations on the bargaining unit. The only information required will be the number of workers in the proposed bargaining unit, with the numbers broken down by category of worker and workplace. The union could not use that information to identify individual workers, and it is implausible that it could affect a company's trading position or endanger its security or that of its work force. </p>
<p> Hon. Members might be worried that the categories of workers might constitute sensitive information in certain circumstances. Indeed, I think that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk raised the issue. However, we are not talking about such a detailed breakdown or about employers having to reveal how many, say, nuclear physicists or encryption experts they employ. For its application to be accepted by the CAC, the union must have given a satisfactory description of its proposed bargaining unit, and it will normally do so in terms of fairly broad occupational classifications. In virtually all cases, the employer's information will not need to go into greater detail. I should note that most employers already share such information with the union when negotiating on the bargaining unit. Our proposal will simply mean that information is shared more systematically and at the earliest appropriate point. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 20 applies to clause 5, which provides for union access from an earlier stage in the process than is currently the case. I hope to explain the clause in greater detail when we discuss amendments Nos. 18 and 19. The earlier union access envisaged will entail sending written material to workers' home addresses via an independent person. To facilitate the process, the CAC will need the employer's collaboration in supplying up-to-date lists of the workers in the proposed bargaining unit, together with their home addresses. That information will then be passed to the independent person who will, if asked to do so by the union, send to workers' home addresses any information with which it supplies him. Clause 5 does not give the union any right to have direct access to workers at their home addresses. </p>

<p> I shall come to that. Amendment No. 20 seeks to protect the right of the employer not to disclose to the appointed person commercially sensitive information or information that might affect the security of the company and its employees. There</p>
<p> has been some over-reaction on that issue. The information to be provided by the employer is merely the names and home addresses of the workers in the bargaining unit, whether it is that proposed by the union, agreed by the parties or decided by the CAC. I do not think that that information is likely to be commercially sensitive, or to endanger the security of the employees or the company. In any case, that is irrelevant because, as I have made clear, the information will be seen only by the CAC and the appointed person. Both are independent and respected.</p>
<p> The satisfaction rate on the way in which the CAC has dealt with such processes is over 80 per cent. That is high compared with that of many other organisations, and there are procedures within the CAC&mdash; </p>

<p> The Minister notes that 80 per cent. are satisfied. However, I saw the figures, and would point out that only some 40 per cent. replied. Considering that 20 per cent. of those were not satisfied, I would not over-egg the point.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman gave that impression. We can argue about the concept but going by experience, by the number of cases that have been dealt with and by the way in which the CAC has dealt with them, there is a great deal of confidence in the way in which it operates and in the independent people concerned, who have passed tests of credibility and of ability to do the job to be on the list of qualified independent people.</p>
<p> Amendment No. 30 concerns the power in clause 12 to widen the number of methods whereby the independent person can communicate the union's material direct to workers in the proposed bargaining unit. It allows the statutory procedure to keep pace with technological developments, particularly the rise of electronic communication, and their increasing use. I hope that the Committee will agree that it makes sense to allow for communications under the statutory procedure to use such systems and technologies, once they are completely established. The power can be used to require employers to disclose information&mdash;for example, e-mail addresses&mdash;to the CAC to enable the independent person to communicate with the workers via the technology in question. </p>
<p> I believe that the aim of amendment No. 30 is to add a similar confidentiality and security provision to the supply of workers' non-postal addresses by the employer. The considerations that I have raised in relation to amendments Nos. 15 and 20 apply equally here. There is no suggestion that the information will be divulged to unions or anybody else by the CAC or the independent person, and there is no reason to believe that any of the information will be commercially sensitive or threaten the security of a company or its staff. </p>
<p> The debate has been important, although it is slightly out of context in terms of the statutory recognition procedure relating to the process that we are undertaking. I hope that, in the light not only of the points that I have made but of the technical difficulties with the amendment, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk will withdraw it. </p>

<p> I have a couple of points to put to the Minister. The debate has been useful, and it has flagged up some important issues, to which the Committee was right to devote time. We are not talking about removing the right of any individual to be properly considered, or the rights of the trade union or the CAC to obtain details about a person and to find out whether he wants to participate in a ballot. All that we are talking about is protecting the person's home address. What happens if a particular employee does not want his home address to be revealed? He might not be in a company that is in a controversial field. It could be that he just does not want his home address to be revealed to anybody. Can that person be protected?</p>

<p> I will double-check, but I think that the individual has to provide information about his name and address to the employer. These are issues relating to employer's insurance and other matters affecting the employee's rights. I will check on them and come back to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p> The point is that some employees might want to insist that their address for all communications be that of the business. I can think of many reasons why they would not want their home address to be revealed if they have specifically requested it. For example, they may be under the witness protection scheme, or trying to escape the clutches of the Child Support Agency. However, it is important that their rights are respected if the individual has specifically requested it.</p>

<p> We are making very good progress under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson, which is extremely encouraging. We are racing ahead.</p>
<p> Clause 5 is a long clause about union communications with workers after the acceptance of the application. The amendments would add new subsections (9) and (10) to the clause. More detail is needed about who the independent persons are. I am not an expert, unlike some members of the Committee who know a lot about how these procedures work, but I do not have a real feel about the sort of people who have applied to go on the informal panel, or about the performance that has so far been achieved. The Minister said that there was an 80 per cent. satisfaction rate, but it was on a small poll of interested parties. </p>
<p> It would be helpful if the Minister told us who these suitable independent persons are. Is there a long waiting list to go on the panel? Is there a ready supply of such people? What sort of people are they? Are they academics, business men, retired trade unionists, ex-Conservative councillors or ex-Labour councillors? How does one get on the list? Does one have to be approved as an expert in labour relations? It would be useful to have more details. The Minister could enlighten us further on these matters. Amendment No. 18 is sensible and fair. </p>

<p> I shall read out a list of the appropriate independent persons.

<p> Presumably, we are talking about members of those particular groups. It would therefore be useful to know how many people there are to choose from. However splendid those people might be, it is possible that the employer, the relevant union or the employees might not be happy with the individual in question. If that were the case, it would be fair for the CAC to accept their opinion and to appoint someone different.</p>
<p> The amendment would give complete parity. It is constructive, pragmatic and fair. It does not detract from subsection (1) and the subsections related to it, but would add two extra subsections that made the appointment procedure much fairer. I doubt that the provision will be used, except in extreme circumstances. However, in some cases, there might be controversy surrounding an individual and, if so, why should not unions, employees or employers be able to object? </p>
<p> On subsection (9), we ask that the CAC should at all times provide a list of persons considered to be suitable and make that list available to all concerned. The Minister might say that that list is available anyway, but the amendment would ensure that that was the case. </p>

<p> Amendment No. 18 is important not only because it would provide that a list of independent persons should be kept, but because it implies that there should be transparency in the CAC, so that confidence in it is maintained. The list of such people, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk made clear, should be available not only to employers, but to unions and relevant workers. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister how the Secretary of State selects the pool of suitable independent persons, and about the controls that are exercised over who does the job. There is an important personal element in selecting a suitable person for a particular case.</p>
<p> Amendment No. 19 would extend the provision by giving the unions, the company and relevant workers the option to veto the appointment of a particular individual as a suitable independent person. I am sure that, in the vast majority of cases, the person selected will be suitable. However, there may be some situations in which one of the parties concerned objects to the appointment of a particular person. It might be that that person has a history in the particular sector that is not liked by one of the parties, or that they are thought to have some conflicts of interest in the case in question. Therefore, we feel that there should be the possibility of a veto. In such a situation, the CAC should appoint an alternative person as soon as reasonably possible. The amendments are straightforward and practical and should be acceptable to all parties involved in the process. </p>

<p> I shall respond to amendments Nos. 18 and 19 together, because they both concern clause 5, which will give the union the right to communicate at an earlier stage with the relevant workers&mdash;the workers in a proposed or agreed bargaining unit. The union will be able to communicate with those workers from the point at which the CAC accepts its application. The statutory procedure already provides for unions to access the relevant work force during the ballot period. Access can take two forms. First, the unions' written material can be sent to the work force</p>
<p> by an independent person appointed by the CAC. Secondly, the unions are entitled to arrange workplace meetings.</p>
<p> By and large, those arrangements have worked satisfactorily. There have been few disputes about arranging such access, and businesses have not been disrupted as a result. The work force know more about the union's position, and are better placed as a result to make an informed decision when casting their votes. </p>
<p> Of course, that access is limited to the short period of the ballot&mdash;usually about 20 days. It is also late in the process. On average, ballots occur about four or more months after an application has been lodged with the CAC. The unions have argued that they should be entitled to some form of access at an earlier stage in the process. They point out that employers have unfettered access throughout the life of an application, and have many more weeks to put across their arguments. </p>
<p> The Government see the force of those arguments. Clause 5 therefore provides arrangements to ensure earlier access for the union. That access will start at the point when the CAC accepts a union's application as admissible. That is a sensible point at which to require access. Everyone will then know that the union's application is a runner and meets the basic criteria of the procedure. It will entail the sending of written material to workers' home addresses via an independent person. </p>
<p> It seems that Opposition Members are concerned about who those independent people might be. I gave them a list of appropriate companies and bodies. They are selected by public competition and are assessed on a variety of criteria, including their internal security systems and confidentiality procedures, to ensure that they are fit to undertake those tasks. They have to go through a rigorous process to be appointed. </p>
<p> I want to clarify an issue raised by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk about the withdrawal of home addresses. I would not accept anyone having the right to withdraw their home address to try to escape from the Child Support Agency. It is vital that people honour their obligations. He chose a bad example, and I am sure that he will withdraw it. However, the question is whether it is reasonable for individuals to withhold home addresses. The CAC can have a view on that and, if a reasonable explanation is given, it can consider it. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 18 seeks to ensure that the CAC makes available to the employer, the union and the relevant workers a list of those persons or organisations qualified to act as independent persons for those purposes. I am sure that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk will be pleased to be able to refer to the list. It includes the company that dealt with the Conservative leadership election in 2001&mdash;Electoral Reform (Ballot Services) Ltd. </p>
<p> During the ballot stage, a qualified independent person is appointed to conduct the ballot and to send written communications on behalf of the union to the workers in the bargaining unit. The Recognition and Derecognition Ballots (Qualified Persons) Order 2000, </p>
<p> statutory instrument 2000/1306, which was amended by SI 2002/2268, sets out the conditions that must be satisfied by an individual or a partnership in order to be a qualified independent person. Further, it names six professional balloting organisations as qualified independent persons. That information is obviously publicly available, and the organisations listed underwent a rigorous selection process for inclusion on that list. I hope that my explanation satisfies the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk about the quality and competence of those people. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 19 seeks to allow any of the parties a right of veto over the appointment of a particular independent person. Such an addition, I believe, is unnecessary. As I mentioned earlier, the independent persons are all professional balloting organisations with track records&mdash;in many cases, long ones&mdash;in conducting and scrutinising a range of ballots and elections. Those organisations take their independence extremely seriously. It is vital for their professional reputation that they are perceived to be impartial in the conduct of their functions. </p>
<p> Qualified independent persons have been sending written material on behalf of the union since the statutory procedure began in June 2000. 1 am not aware of any complaints about their handling of such communications. Of course, if any improprieties were ever to come to our attention, we would act swiftly to investigate and, if necessary, amend the order to which I referred to remove a person from the list. Indeed, the law states that, in order for someone to be an independent person, there must be no grounds for believing that that person's independence could be reasonably called into question. </p>
<p> Amendment No. 19 is therefore unnecessary. It is also undesirable. A right for any party to veto the appointment of a suitable independent person would introduce unwanted delay to the process. Indeed, an unscrupulous employer or union could, under the amendment as drafted, string out the process by simply vetoing the CAC's appointments repeatedly. </p>
<p> Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are not necessary. Moreover, amendment No. 19 could be harmful by introducing delay. I hope that, in the light of that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. He said quite a lot about the way in which the organisations are approved by the Government but there has been less detail about the individuals who are members of these organisations. How many are there and how are they selected by the organisations? When he talked about impropriety, did he mean that the organisation would be struck off, or would action be taken against the individual?</p>

<p> I agree 100 per cent. They do a superb job. I always defer to their wisdom and expertise. That is why amendment No.3 is identical to amendment No. 2. Amendment No. 23 amends clause 5 and it brings us back to the essence of privacy and the rights of individuals.</p>
<p> There is only one point that I would like to ask the Minister about. A particular employee may be adamant and passionate about his home privacy being protected. I was not trying to be flippant earlier. The CSA has the right to attach to someone's earnings but that would be through his place of employment. His place of employment and the details of his payroll would obviously be known to the CSA, but he might want to keep his private address confidential, for whatever reason. A female employee, for instance, might be concerned about her ex-husband coming to her address. There are many other reasons, each </p>
<p> private and specific to the employee in question. We are debating the broad issues concerning employee rights, which is why the amendment is important. </p>

<p> I support the amendment but, in deference to your request, Mr. Stevenson, I shall concentrate on amendment No. 23. In order to protect workers from intrusions on their privacy, that amendment would require the appointed independent person to</p>
<p><span class="indent">''ascertain from each of the relevant workers whether he consents to the disclosure of his details to the union'' </span></p>
<p>before he disclosed the information. If management agrees to disclose the information, or even if management has a problem but the CAC forces disclosure, why should the individual's right to privacy be overlooked? The clause concerns union access before balloting but what if someone is not a union member? There are no collective bargaining rights at that stage. The individual who is not a union member may well resent the union being given his name and address for the purposes of mailshots, as I would. Why should that person not have the right to say, ''I don't want my personal details to go to the union''? Whether or not they want to join the union, that right is a stand-alone right that should be preserved. </p>

<p> I am mindful of the fact that we partly discussed such issues in connection with earlier amendments. I should like to return to the relationship of the CAC and the independent person, which we need to deal with. The individual does not have to receive information directly from the union, because it comes via the qualified independent person. The independent person sends out information on behalf of the union, which makes amendment No. 23 redundant. Both the CAC and the independent person are quite strong on their independence and the way they protect data and the information that they divulge, for the reasons I mentioned earlier. We do not want to complicate the situation further, which is what the amendment would do, in that the qualified independent person would have to seek approval from individual workers to pass on their home addresses.</p>
<p> In the earlier debate, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk asked whether the individual could just give the business address as the appropriate address. That would not comply with the employer's duty to disclose the home address, but it would be for the CAC to decide whether the failure to provide that address was reasonable. The question would concern the circumstances and factors surrounding the employer's request to offer another address, which the CAC has the power to consider. </p>
<p> The CAC takes seriously its responsibilities under data protection legislation, under which it is registered as a data controller. It adheres to all the provisions of the relevant legislation, including that personal data should be kept only for as long as it is needed and that appropriate technical and organisational measures should be taken to avoid any unauthorised use of such </p>
<p> information. All such work is evidence-based and conducted within the framework of the statutory recognition procedures, which have worked well. </p>
<p> The CAC has never received any complaints from a worker about unsolicited communications from a union. There is no need to add explicit references to privacy in the procedure. That could complicate matters further and lead to unnecessary disputes between the parties about the existence of any threat to privacy. </p>
<p> I notice that the amendment would ensure that no similar privacy considerations apply to the employer. The employer can send out as many written communications as he likes, regardless of whether the worker feels that such communications infringes his domestic peace and privacy. </p>

<p> Surely at that stage, there is a fundamental difference. The employer has a legal duty to the employee, whereas the union has no legal responsibility, because it has not been recognised?</p>

<p> The employer has the names and the opportunity to give any material to the employees. A balanced, independent judgment will be made on whether individuals want to recognise the union. Employers have an unfettered right to write as many times as possible.</p>
<p> Amendment No. 3 concerns the power to widen the number of methods whereby the independent person can communicate the union's material directly to the workers in the bargaining unit. Employers have that power, too. This has been an important debate as it has highlighted the difference of attitude towards such processes between the Government and the Opposition. Amendment No. 23 is redundant because there is no direct communication between the union and the individual worker. As the debate has progressed, there seems to be some mistrust of the union's motives&mdash;it has recruited a number of members&mdash;in its consideration of the next stage. That is a fundamental difference that will scar our discussions. In the light of my explanations, I ask the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk to withdraw his amendment. </p>

<p> The amendments are basically about treating people fairly and equally. The right of unions to have the appointed independent person distribute information on demand should be extended to non-unionised workers. Let us assume that the company wants recognition. What if a group of workers do not want effectively to be unionised&mdash;they would not be union members, but they would be unionised through the recognition agreement&mdash;or forced into a deal between the company and the union? What if those workers do not like a particular union that is applying for recognition and want another? Why should they not be able to write to other workers and put their case forward? We keep returning to the point about carving up responsibility between unions and companies. The reality is that the situation is often more complicated, and the amendments recognise that fact.</p>

<p> I can deal with that point quickly. The amendments intend to wreck the whole relationship between the union, which is the external force, and the employer and employees. The employer has the right to discuss recognition issues with his or her employees, and people who do not want to join the union have a right to discuss the issues with their colleagues.</p>
