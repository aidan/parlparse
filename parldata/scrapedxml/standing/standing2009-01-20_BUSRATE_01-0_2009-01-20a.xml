<p> Before we begin, I shall draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the normal procedure. First, would you make sure that your mobile phones are switched to silent? I shall check mine in a minute. There is a money resolution in connection with the Bill&#151;copies are available in the room. Also, the formal warning about starred amendments: in general, my fellow Chairmen and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the slightly new system, I shall outline what will happen today. The Committee will be asked to consider the programme motion, on which debate is limited to half an hour. We then proceed to the motions to report written evidence and to permit the Committee to deliberate in private&#151;I hope that we can deal with them formally&#151;in advance of the oral evidence sessions. Assuming that the motion is agreed, the Committee will move into private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, witnesses and members of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral evidence session will commence. The arrangements are similar to those in a Select Committee&#151;look at the brief provided and we shall work out who wants to ask any questions.</p>
<p>If the programme motion is agreed, the Committee will hear oral evidence this morning, this afternoon and on Thursday morning. On Thursday, the Committee will meet in the Boothroyd room, moving to the more familiar scene of the Committee corridor next week and reverting to the normal clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill. Is that reasonably clear to everyone? We shall see if we can find our way through that.</p>

<p> Before I question the witnesses, I wish to say what a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I hope that that is the proper way in which to start our proceedings. It is a new process for all of us, and you are very welcome in the Chair.</p>
<p>Ms Milne, I wonder whether you can help me. The background to such matters stems very much from the Lyons report and the suggestions of flexibility and an appetite for engagement with local authorities and business. What is your assessment of whether this will assist local authorities in engaging with business? Do you see other potential pitfalls?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> We think that we already have a good model for engagement between business and local authorities in the business improvement districts and the way in which they are organised, so that there is a genuine conversation and partnership between the two parties in developing proposals that will benefit the &nbsp;communities. I am afraid that the business rate supplements proposals try to short-cut some of those processes, such that there may not be a proper conversation between local authorities and the business community. They have the air of something that might be imposed on business, rather than being worked out together with business.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> In terms of developing the prospectus, although there is talk of consultation once the initial prospectus has been published, it is to appear as if by magic from the local authority, whereas within the BIDs process there is a genuine engagement of business at the initial stages, so that the whole project is worked up together in partnership.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> One of the key things that gives everybody an incentive to work together within BIDs is the fact that there is a mandatory ballot that has to approve the whole project before it can go forward. That means that everybody has an incentive to work together to find schemes that genuinely address the issues within the community and that therefore will benefit the community.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> The problem with rateable value is that it is, in effect, an input tax. It does not try to match contributions to the benefits that will be derived from a given project, so there is no proportionment between different sectors of the economy. Because retail is a property-intensive sector and retailers have relatively little choice in which properties they occupy&#151;they need to be in the high-access, high-footfall areas like the high street or certain retail parks&#151;we have historically seen rents and property values, and hence rateable values, move up much more sharply for retailers than for office accommodation or other parts of business. Therefore, as Tom said, not only do we pay 25 per cent. of the overall rates bill, while actually generating 8 per cent. of GDP by value&#151;we are paying three times our overall output&#151;but that is likely to increase rather than decrease in future, so we see the burden falling increasingly heavily on us. In some respects it is the modern equivalent of a hearth tax or a window tax; it is not actually about the overall prosperity of different sectors in the community.</p>

<p> May I take up a couple of the points you have made and refer back to one of the points in your written evidence? You talked about retailers paying about a quarter of all business rates and you estimated that about a quarter of any business rate supplement will be met by your members. The retail sector is very diverse&#151;it includes small shops as well as large ones. Under the design of the scheme, it is proposed that those with rateable values of under &#163;50,000 will be excluded. What is your estimate of the proportion of total business rates paid by your members with rateable values over &#163;50,000?</p>

<p> I hear that message. However, you made the point that you expected your members to meet 25 per cent. of business rate supplement contributions.

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> Retailers are facing a crunch of a different nature from the credit crunch that we often hear about. They have a number of rising costs, including the rising costs of the goods that they put on their shelves, because the falling exchange rates make imports more expensive. There are a number of business rate increases coming through the pipeline too, in terms of the annual uplift and the 2010 review, and when you tot them all up it comes to an increase of as much as &#163;1.6 billion, which is a 30 per cent. increase in the rates bill. In addition, with the national minimum wage and so on there are a number of other cost pressures coming through while, at the same time, customers are looking for reduced prices. We are helping to deliver the reduction in inflation that is coming through very rapidly at the moment through discounting and the like. We are therefore getting to the point at which there are such thin margins that pushing up the rates bill inevitably puts jobs at risk.

<p> But you can see the logic. Economic development for local authorities has, certainly in the past ten to 15 years, been a focus, and it most probably was 20 or 30 years ago. You say that you hope that local authorities would not impose the increase. I ask the question again: what evidence do you have? Do you have any evidence at all that local authorities would impose an increase on business that would be contrary to their economic development? Which local authority would do that, when doing so would cause many jobs to be lost?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> Perhaps one issue concerns cases in which the local authority has a different view of what would be beneficial to the community from the business community. We would not suggest that local authorities were deliberately setting out to cause business problems&#151;of course not&#151;but they might not fully appreciate all the issues involved. The BIDs process enables all of that to be worked through and a very high-quality proposal to come forward. The fact that about 85 per cent. of BIDs have been supported by the local business community demonstrates that that process genuinely gives rise to projects that are seen to be beneficial to the community and, therefore, attract the business community&#146;s support.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> At the outset of a project, people in the local authority, in retail, and in other business sectors, as well as key community players, sit down and come up with a proposal that meets the specific issues that that community faces. Retail has a good track record of working with local authorities and of involvement in regeneration projects through BIDs and other means. That very close arrangement ensures that the issues that must be addressed and the best ways to address them are worked out.</p>

<p> I hesitate to paraphrase, but you said in answer to earlier questions that the principle of some form of supplementary business rate to fund a project that the business community in that area thought would be beneficial to the whole community, including its ability to trade, prosper and play a part in economic development, is not the problem. If it signs up to a project, the problem is how it is arrived at and delivered. Is that fair?</p>

<p> Would a ballot for the BRS as well, which many are arguing for, be sufficient?

<p> Ms Milne, I think that all of us here have some sympathy with many of your members, given the tumultuous economic events of recent months. However, I want to explore one or two of your answers and to ask one or two questions, partly on the BIDs process, but also more generally. You said that you are not averse to the principle of making a contribution to infrastructure projects. You were asked whether that would be through a property-related tax, and I am not sure whether you had any other ideas in mind. How do you think that large-scale infrastructure projects, such as Crossrail in London, which obviously affects my constituency, can possibly be funded?</p>

<p> One of my concerns, being slightly devil&#146;s advocate with your approach&#151;I appreciate that you have to speak on behalf of your members&#151;is that, ultimately, people will argue that all these retailers and many tenants in properties have cut a pretty bad deal with their landlords to get the property. The commercial property market was buoyant until the past 18 months or so, but you have cut a bad deal with your landlords and you now want to oppose the Bill. You are acting to the detriment of the public at large, who desperately need some large-scale infrastructure projects. There needs to be a way of funding them. We have looked at the whole issue of value capture. This debate does not just go back a few years; it goes back many decades, and it concerns the whole idea of how to ensure that a proper project is in place for something that is for the common good. What do you say to that criticism? I understand that you have to argue your case, but is it entirely self-interest?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> First, I touched earlier on the fact that the retail property market does not necessarily work in a perfect manner, particularly during a growing economy. The costs of renting and leasing retail property have accelerated much faster than other sectors. An awful lot of that value sits with the developer, not necessarily with the occupier.</p>

<p> That, as you say, is potentially a market failure, but it is ultimately an issue of being able, with the benefit of decades-worth of hindsight, to cut the right deal.

<p> I will take you down to Victoria street, in my constituency, where there are enough voids to make one think that it is not quite so much a sellers&#146; market now. I appreciate that those are the market conditions, but I expect that that applies to my hon. Friends&#146; constituencies. The market clearly has turned.</p>
<p>I also want to touch on BIDs. There are BIDs in my constituency&#151;the New West End Company and the Paddington Waterside Partnership&#151;and they have worked well. Superficially, I can understand one of the arguments that you made: effectively, it sounds like double counting&#151;you become part of BIDs and then potentially you also have the maximum 2p surcharge through business rates. Do you see that there is a view that what a BID is trying to do is somewhat different from what the Bill is trying to achieve? The BID process is looking at some additional spending&#151;to get a few more police, to smarten up a rather small vicinity&#151;whereas the Bill is proposing to get much larger-scale infrastructure projects?</p>
<p>I accept that Crossrail is an exception in terms of costing a total of &#163;16 billion or &#163;17 billion, with about &#163;3 billion to be covered, ideally, by the BRS under the Bill. However, the same will apply on a smaller scale elsewhere across the country. It is a quite different idea. The BIDs are there for additionality in a very small location, whereas the idea of the Bill is to look at large-scale infrastructure projects that would otherwise not be funded, because, clearly, there would always be other priorities from local and central Government.

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> First, of course, it comes back to the additionality of the benefits and how those stack up; but also, as I mentioned previously, it relates to the distribution of those benefits. In the case of Crossrail, where we have had some modelling done, we find that the benefits that retailers are likely to derive at &#163;17 billion are just less than half the costs that they will be asked to provide. It is just adding extra cost, without delivering extra benefits.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> I think that an arrangement whereby we as a sector made a proportionate contribution, linked to the benefits that we were going to derive from it, would be much easier to swallow; but retail tends to be a very high component of BIDs, and that is why we end up with this double whammy.

<p> You say that retail accounts for a high proportion of BIDs. Of course, there is a fairly fundamental difference between BIDs and the BRS, in that the &#163;50,000 rateable value threshold does not apply in the case of BIDs, which are often designed specifically to help a range of retailers, including small ones.

<p> The crucial point that I want to establish, and want you to agree on, is that there is a pretty fundamental difference between major infrastructure development and the kind of objective with which BIDs have been very successful. I strongly support BIDs and introduced them as a Minister, so I am wholly behind them, but they were about regenerating and building confidence on high streets, rather than about supporting major infrastructure development.</p>

It is only where vacant properties and new leases are being taken on that we are really seeing the benefit of that. However, given that we have vacancies on high streets, and property owners are taking a rather different attitude to the market, there has possibly been more of a shift within the retail sector than other sectors. There is a shift in the balance between our and other parts of the economy.</p>

<p> May I just ask a hypothetical question? What if the legislation were to be amended to make a ballot&#151;governed by a dual-key mechanism&#151;mandatory?

<p> I find that interesting, because I have seen some figures for Crossrail&#151;the project does not affect my constituency directly but it does affect the neighbouring one&#151;which showed that businesses, not in Oxford street but in the suburbs, were going to benefit considerably from the extra people that Crossrail could bring in. That study was done before the current climate, and the figures might be different now, but that does not mean that in the longer term there could not be bonuses for businesses.

<p><span class="italic">Tom Ironside:</span> I will give you a little more background on the modelling that was undertaken. It was carried out by Oxford Economics and looked at a London-wide picture. It estimated a cost of &#163;34 million per annum to the retail sector in London from the time that the BRS was introduced, and at the same time it estimated that the benefit once the Crossrail project was completed would be &#163;15 million per annum. Those are the headlines of the research. We have the research document, which I am sure has already been shared with Government Departments. We would be only too happy to provide you with it, as well. I do not have a copy with me&#151;it is a 10 or 12-page document&#151;but we would be more than happy to share it with the Committee if that were useful.</p>

<p> We would obviously want you to share that with us, but we are trying to square the circle here. As Mr. Scott said a few moments ago, we are talking about some 600,000 additional people living in east London, who will be carried through Crossrail either to work or to make purchases at all the stops along the line. Looking superficially, it seems that there would be significant benefits not just for central London but all along the Crossrail route, yet you suggest otherwise. I am trying to cope with how you have come up with a different set of figures from almost everyone else.</p>
<p>One of the questions I critically want to ask is, what is your time scale for the figures that you have produced? In the submission by the Mayor of London, he says:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;The long-term benefits of Crossrail to business will far outweigh the costs to them of the BRS.&#148;</p>
<p>He goes on to say:</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;All London&#146;s boroughs will benefit from Crossrail&#148;,</p>
<p>not just those through which Crossrail passes. That is a definitive set of findings. The Mayor would not have come up with that if he had thought there would be any challenge. But you are saying not only that it does not work but the benefit is only half the cost to retailers. We have always assumed that retailers would be among the main beneficiaries of this scheme.

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> I would like to understand why you think the existence of a railway will mean that people will want to buy more.

<p> Let me put it to you this way. Where the underground has been extended, all the evidence suggests that there is a significant benefit, not just in terms of people flows but in terms of the value of properties close to the underground. It has to be assumed that that will be the case with Crossrail. It will carry huge numbers of people, albeit perhaps not more than the overall underground network carries, yet you are asking us to believe that retailers will not benefit. I find that incredible, especially as almost everyone else suggests that there will not just be significant but overwhelming benefits to business from the building of Crossrail.</p>

<p> Okay. We will need to see the figures.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a final question, again trying to square the circle. As has already been said by Mr. Raynsford, all of the business organisations in London have come out strongly in favour of Crossrail, and there is a significant retail element within them. Yet you are telling us that your members are overwhelmingly opposed to this Bill and what it will achieve in terms of building Crossrail. How representative is London within the overall British Retail Consortium? Does it account for 11 or 12 per cent. of your membership, or a much higher proportion? How representative is London and have its views in retail terms been taken on board regarding your attitude to this Bill?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Jane Milne:</span> In so far as we have the overwhelming majority of the major brands, which have a significant presence in London, those companies are clearly taking a view on both the specific Crossrail and London &nbsp;question and the broader question of BRS across the rest of the UK.

<p> And that would mean, in your opinion, that any consultation that takes place will be more focused on ensuring that everybody is signed up effectively.</p>
<p>We had a discussion about Crossrail. Most, if not all, of the Committee would no doubt feel that Crossrail is a project worthy of support, which we are eager to see go ahead. However, there has been an Act of Parliament and intensive scrutiny and discussion about Crossrail, its viability and what effects it might have. Most of the measures under the Bill would have nothing like that. Would you say that that makes them different from Crossrail and that there is a clear distinction between the way in which the Bill enables Crossrail to be funded and to take place on the model that has been set out, and the potential for other schemes across the country?</p>

<p> Good morning, Mr. Frost. I would be grateful if you outlined the overall view of the British Chambers of Commerce. I read your submission, and as you represent 100,000 businesses across the UK, I do not think that any of us will suggest that you are not representative. The Lyons review set forward the idea of greater flexibility in business rates and discussed the existence of an appetite for greater engagement with local authorities on economic development. Is this proposal the right way to get that?</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> The British Chambers of Commerce network is made up of 53 accredited chambers of commerce. The one thing that I have learned in my time in this job is that chambers of commerce have&#151;and share strongly with their local authorities&#151;a real sense of pride in place and real passion: a desire for their community to be the best. If it is not the best they want to look at measures to make sure that it is.</p>
<p>Chambers of commerce and local authorities also share legitimacy. The boards of chambers of commerce are elected from the business community, from a membership. The business members of those chambers are typified by a strong sense of identity with the area. Theirs are frequently second or third-generation businesses. Those businesses will not move to the other side of the globe; they have an owner-manager who lives in the area, whose children go to school there and whose partner could be a school governor or magistrate. Those people have a strong sense of place.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a view, clearly expressed in a number of parts of the country, that there is a need for more local determination and, to be fair, for the ability to raise additional revenue from the business community, among others, for local projects that will benefit and develop the local economy. The issue is that we are not sure that the business rate supplement is necessarily the way to do that outside London.</p>

From the point of view of the business community how does all that tie together? Where is the overall strategy to improve the community? The business community&#146;s worry, in difficult economic times, is that there will essentially be layering of one charge on another to raise additional funds for local authority expenditure.</p>

<p> In your opening comment you said&#151;and I strongly agree&#151;that chambers of commerce have a strong pride in their place. They often work with local authorities to enhance the area. When we came on to discuss Crossrail, in response to Mr. Neill&#146;s question, you said that it was a unique project. You indicated that you were quite sympathetic to the idea that the measure should apply in London only, but that the wider power should not be available. What do you think would be the view of a chamber of commerce in, say, Leeds, Manchester or another part of the country which felt that there was a real need for a major infrastructure project that would enhance the economy and improve the place, but which was told that it could not do it because the Bill has been limited to London?</p>

<p> That was a specific response to a question about a congestion charging scheme, not about the need for necessary infrastructure investment that a local authority and the business community would see as improving the quality of their area.

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> My point is that there is an understanding that improvement in infrastructure is needed at local level; the business community&#146;s concern is that there does not seem to be a coherent strategy on how that money should be raised. Government Departments seem to be fishing around for a way of doing that, whether it be congestion charging, a workplace car parking levy, a business rate supplement or an accelerated development zone. There seems to be a whole range of initiatives here, with no real thought being given to what we are trying to do and what the single strand is by which we should seek to raise that money. The business community is worried that we will simply get a series of layering on. So, for example, you would raise the money for a business rate supplement, and two years down the track the next idea would be a business improvement district and then a workplace car parking levy and perhaps even congestion charging after that. There is a very real fear that business is simply seen as a cash cow, without these programmes having a strategic idea behind them.</p>

<p> I hear that message, but I simply want to come back to the question. A chamber of commerce in a particular locality might believe that it was extremely important to get a major infrastructure development, which would benefit business and towards which it would be reasonable for business to make a contribution. If it looked at London and saw Crossrail being built on exactly that basis, how would you explain to it that it cannot do that even though it wants to do it because the Bill does not apply outside London?</p>

<p> I think you said in your evidence that there has been active involvement by the business community in London in the funding of Crossrail. It is very supportive of Crossrail, and regard it as a successful model. Let us remember that this is for a scheme that has been talked about for 20 years. It has taken a very long time to get to the point where, at last, it appears to be proceeding because there is now a broad-based funding model that looks credible. Why should that option not be available to any other part of the country?</p>

<p> I suppose the issue is that they cannot do that at the moment, so the Bill is important in its wider scope beyond London, to allow communities to do so. Perhaps we need to explore that message and return to it later.</p>
<p>We have not dealt with ballots. Is that what you are getting at? You have talked about engagement with the community. The message from our previous witnesses was that the Bill would be far more reassuring to their members if a ballot was a standard part of the imposition of a supplementary rate.</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> The ballot and the timing of a BID are one of the measure&#146;s most attractive elements because, first, they have forced the business community and agencies, particularly local authorities, to find out what communities want. Secondly, they have forced them to get out and sell the concept of a business improvement district, and explain the added value. The BID then goes to a ballot. We think that the simple majority and the measures concerning the aggregate rateable values form a good twin-track approach. At the end of five years, you have to go and resell the concept; that is democracy at work and it is a good thing. That is why the BID concept is strongly supported.</p>

<p> I am a former business man. I had a business that was based in the City, so I understand your critique or concern that, as a whole, the Government often regard business as a cash cow. I would have used that critique myself when I was on the other side of the fence, before I joined the public sector. Do you not appreciate that there is disbursement on different initiatives, whether BIDs, the whole BRS thing or the accelerated development service, partly because of the level of hostility, so we need small parcels with identifiable, quite distinct benefits for business, otherwise business just thinks that it is all more and more Government on its back. If business can see that there are distinct benefits&#151;there are quite different benefits, as we saw in our discussion about BIDs, for example&#151;do you not accept that that concern is in the mind of any Government who are trying to raise money for large infrastructure projects.</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> No, I just think that there is a lack of coherence. I do not think that a debate is taking place about how much money should be raised at a local level and how that can best be done. There appear to be a range of different &#147;innovative&#148; schemes to raise money at a local level, without any thought being given as to how they dovetail together&#151;if at all. That is what creates the worries in the business community. It signs up for one business improvement district, which for the reasons I have given has strong supporters, and then finds all of a sudden that the local authority wants to run with workplace parking charging and the BRS, whatever we have gone into.</p>

<p> But as I understand it, one of your objectives is the transparency of the initiatives. The idea of value capture goes back a long time. It is quite an historical idea, and an element of it in a London context goes back to the Jubilee line extension, when there were huge benefits to the community at large, but &nbsp;specific large benefits to landowners that almost came as windfall gains. There is an element whereby matters of Crossrail and elsewhere have been trying as far as possible to balance out the issues. I appreciate that this is difficult: if we had had this discussion a couple of years ago, you might have found it easier going than now, with the travails and tumultuous economic events of the past year and the difficulties ahead. However, can you understand that there often have been huge windfall gains for property owners, particularly in large infrastructure projects, where they happen to own property nearby, which seems to be at odds with some of the benefits that need to be spread more widely across communities in such projects?</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> I would also say that there will be much greater and wider economic benefits to the area, in job creation and regeneration of communities.

<p> I do not entirely agree with what Ministers are saying specifically about Crossrail. My party has some concerns with elements of the legislation. I possibly have slightly fewer concerns about the principles of the measure than one or two other members of my party. However, regarding the benefits of Crossrail, the Bill will raise only &#163;3.25 billion for a project whose cost of is currently envisaged to be between &#163;16 billion and &#163;17 billion. That is a relatively small figure; it is less than a fifth of the overall cost. Do you not think that within the context of those overall benefits, which will be seen, too, by many generations of businesses, to pay about a fifth of that cost is in the ball park of equitability?</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> As I say, I can see that, but what I want to see when we have taken the London issue out is much greater transparency, as you say, and much greater openness to the involvement of the business community. It is not my role, nor should it be, to say that business communities the length and breadth of this country should not have the power to look at how to get new developments, particularly new forms of regeneration in their communities over the coming years. However, it is my role to reflect some of the very real concerns about how we will ensure the survival of good projects such as the business improvement district. Equally, we are not going to allow the business community to be seen just as a cash cow and have the relentless layering of one project after another.</p>

<p> Given the initial approach of your submission, which is really to heap one possible charge on another, on another, on another, with the implication that to your members the business rate supplement is either the thin or the thick end of the wedge, I am not surprised that lots of your members may have come back to chambers of commerce around the country and said, &#147;We do not want it, and if London wants it let it get on with it on its own&#148;. Of course, as Mr. Raynsford skilfully probed, Crossrail is unique by definition, because it is unique to London, but it is not unique as a major transport or infrastructure project that might benefit different parts of the country.</p>
<p>I will not speak for Greater Manchester, Warrington or Wigan or even as far as Runcorn, but in north Staffordshire for example, where there is a very active chamber of commerce, some of our transport links are &nbsp;the worst in the country. If you can get into the centre of Stoke, you will find that it is very difficult to get out. My constituency, Newcastle-under-Lyme, has the distinction of being, post-Beeching, the largest town in Britain without any form of railway. If a scheme in north Staffordshire were to be constructed on the table, with different innovative sources of finance, as was the case with Crossrail, which has the support of many London Members, I suspect that the chamber of commerce, given that it is screaming out for better transport in the area, might take a different view. I suspect that that might be replicated around the country. Have you considered that?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> Having followed for many years the unravelling debate about the great separation of the A500 through north Staffordshire, I fully appreciate the interests of the area. I come back to the point about what may well happen in the community in north Staffordshire. I strongly suggest that because of the impact of the downturn, not least on the ceramics sector, there will be a debate about how that area is regenerated. It is about much more than building roads.</p>
<p>The business community wants an open and transparent debate about, first, what is needed from a range of options and, secondly, what method will be used to fund it&#151;and we want a vote on it, which is where the BID comes in&#151;to get rid of the concern that, after we have paid for something that will be in place for many years, the local authority will propose yet another levy to do something else, so that business communities, during an immensely difficult economic time, will find that more and more costs are being ramped up on them.</p>
<p>To talk specifically about transport&#151;a question that is constantly thrown at me as I go round the country to talk about congestion charging, workplace parking and whatever&#151;that is why we are expected to provide more money when we are already paying nearly &#163;50 billion in road tax. People ask &#147;Why am I expected to pay more money at a local level?&#148;</p>

<p> To examine your stance in more detail, I think that you are right to moderate the stance that you have taken in your submission, in response to the question from my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich, because it is feasible that around the rest of the country the proposal might be a goer, and the answer &#147;Well you cannot have it because it is only for London&#148; would not be satisfactory.</p>
<p>I want to ask one final counter-factual or hypothetical question. Given that the business rate is nationally determined&#151;there is a nationally determined pricing system&#151;and that, particularly with the current slump, certain areas of economic activity could be spurred by business rate reductions, has your membership given any consideration internally to the question of whether chambers of commerce would support a business rate reduction Bill, which might apply locally in different areas?</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> I am not sure we want to get into business rate relocalisation. There is a view that there should be much more local determination but, equally, many of our members and I have long memories and remember the early 1980s, when local authorities were in difficult times and levied substantial increases in the business rate, often beyond 15 per cent. That acts as a drag on any debate about relocalisation, which must be introduced if we are talking about business rate reduction.</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> That is what we have said. We are extremely attracted to the business improvement district concept, for reasons that I have mentioned: transparency, the need for the community to sell the concept, the twin track to getting a vote and the fact that a BID is time-limited and must be renewed. For many of the programmes outside London, that is the method and route that we should take. Our concern is that if a BRS is introduced, the concept of BIDs will dissolve.</p>

<p> It seems to me that your strongest objection&#151;you said that you do not have an objection in principle&#151;is that there are several areas in which councils can introduce charges, such as congestion charges or workplace parking levies, and the BRS will be another one. I think that you said there was no coherence, which surprises me. Those are the sorts of tools and mechanisms that councils will have, but it will be for the local authorities, working with business, to set out the strategies for using them. Surely, the supplement would be a case in point. I could be wrong and may be being too generous, but I cannot imagine a council suddenly, off the top of its head, producing a scheme without talking to business or trying to develop a strategy that has to have the support of business to take it forward.</p>
<p>In some ways, are we repeating the arguments that we had in the &#146;70s and &#146;80s, when there were loony left councils and when businesses were seen as part of the capitalist world, so we just stuck rates on them. We have moved on tremendously in the past 20 or 25 years. The <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> made an important point that councils have significantly raised their game in the past decade&#151;we are in a new environment, a new culture. Some Opposition thinking seems to be based on the old situation, which existed back in the &#146;70s and &#146;80s, and not on what exists today. There are much more forward-thinking councils, which like economic strategies that involve business&#151;that closely involve business. Should we not be trying to work this through, rather than saying, &#147;Well, we don&#146;t believe it&#146;s coherent&#148;?

<p> I would like to return to the question of compatibility and the similarity between this sort of approach and BIDs.</p>
<p>We have already discussed ballots, which are part of the BID process. In the view of your members, were ballots to be part of the BRS process too, that would improve the measure. However, is it not important to distinguish between BIDs and what we are talking about here? BIDs are not designed to set up and fund infrastructure projects on the scale that we are talking about&#151;key projects to unlock economic development across a whole county or area. Do you accept that that purpose is a different one to that of a BID?</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> Not necessarily. If one looks, for example, at Coventry, there is now a city-wide BID running there. BIDs are no longer run purely for town centres or high streets. The vision included in a lot of them is now far greater. I see no reason why the concept could not extend county-wide, and certainly across borough boundaries.</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> It could well be worth while looking at some of the sums that could be raised in some of the metropolitan boroughs from a BID, as opposed to a business rate supplement. You may well find that the funding was far greater, because of the &#163;50,000 minimis on the RVs, which is not the situation with the BIDs.

Perhaps it is just an appreciation for my own constituency, where locations are often two or three streets from the new west end, Oxford street and Regent street and on one or two small alleyways just off that. So it operates through the whole city, and all businesses&#151;retail and otherwise&#151;pay their supplement towards a city-wide BID?</p>

The BID is there for five years, they have been forced to sell it and the business community gets on and does it.

<p> Let me put a hypothetical case to you. I am sorry to do this as I do not generally like hypothetical cases, but let us take a small BID area where 10 per cent. of the businesses are sceptical of the benefits. What is to stop them saying, &#147;Let us not have the BID in this small area because we will lose. Let us have it in the metropolitan area, where there might be a much better chance of being successful in persuading the business community&#148;? What would be lost is the essential part of the BID that should be developed in the town centre. That would be lost because of the attempt to spread it too far.

<p> In your evidence, you are clear that you strongly support the BID process, in particular the active engagement of business because there will always be a ballot. With BRS, where the business contribution is over 30 per cent., there has to be a ballot. Is there any difference in such cases between BRS and the BID mechanism?</p>

<p> To pursue the question, do you think 30 per cent. is too high and should it be lower? There is quite a strong case that if business is asked to make a de minimis contribution, it should not be in a position to veto something supported by a large number of other people. We touched on that with Mr. Field&#146;s questioning in relation to Crossrail. Are you unhappy about the 30 per cent. or do you argue for a mandatory ballot in all cases, even recognising that in some cases that might kill a worthwhile project because, even though the business contribution was de minimis, it still had a right to vote it down?</p>

<p> So you have accepted the 30 per cent. You think there should be threshold and that 30 per cent. is probably the right one. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="italic">David Frost:</span> All I would say is: be careful. It is a fine balance between the need to regenerate business communities across the UK and reaching a position where you may be threatening businesses in clearly difficult times. I come back to the point that our members fear having one charge after another levied on them.</p>
