<p> As the hon. Gentleman says, it is all in the notes. I was simply going to observe, given the Committee&rsquo;s inexhaustible appetite for information, that the clauses dealing with petroleum revenue tax are relatively uncontentious. They implement a commitment that the Government made in last year&rsquo;s pre-Budget report to even up some discrepancies in petroleum revenue taxation. We understand that the clauses are welcomed by the industry, and nothing has been raised with us. I have no further questions or points to raise.</p>

<p> Clauses 101 and 102 go together. I want to ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary&mdash;he may need to write to me, because we are pressed for time&mdash;whether the clauses on petroleum tax will have an effect on carbon capture and storage, because in the North sea, the old oilfields, the use of which has been discontinued, may well be used as a repository for carbon dioxide to be pumped and stored there for ever.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-05-08_FIN_14-0_2007-06-07a.3.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury"  time="13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/finance/070607/pm/70607s01.htm#07060783000029" colnum="502">
<p> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Gale. I add my congratulations to those expressed earlier on the promotion of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary is the Minister responsible for oil and gas industry issues in the Treasury, but he is currently in the Chamber, &nbsp;about to speak on another matter, so I have taken it on myself to answer and to lead the debate in his absence.</p>
<p>As the hon. Member for Wycombe said, the measure was first announced in the 2006 pre-Budget report and will remedy a problem that arose during discussions between the Government and the industry on the wider strategic issues facing the North sea fiscal regime by providing for the removal of petroleum revenue tax from oil and gas fields where full decommissioning has been completed&mdash;that is, all infrastructure has been removed and the fields in effect have been returned to bare seabed&mdash;and the fields are subsequently redeveloped.</p>
<p>Under current legislation, if a field on which PRT was chargeable was fully decommissioned and later recommissioned, it could still be liable to PRT. However, the challenge of redeveloping a previously decommissioned field is closest in appearance to the challenge of developing a completely new field. I am referring to fields on untouched seabed, which are not liable to PRT; it was abolished for new fields in 1993. Therefore, it is arguable that there is a disincentive to recommission old fields. Clause 101 is designed to remedy that anomaly and create a level playing field between old decommissioned fields and new fields. As the hon. Gentleman said, the change has been welcomed by the industry following consultation.</p>
<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West raised the issue of carbon capture and storage. As he will know, new technologies can potentially be used to extract carbon dioxide from gas or coal during the energy production process. Therefore, it will be possible to deliver carbon free, or substantially reduced carbon, electricity from coal and gas and for those carbon dioxide gases to be taken away and stored.</p>
<p>One option is to store those gases in previously used oilfields in the North sea. The Government are considering how to encourage and develop those technologies. My assumption, though, is that if one of those fields is subsequently to be used for such a practice, it would come under a different tax regime to the one that would be applied here. In this instance, we are trying to ensure that it is tax free for the development of new petroleum oil production. If an incentive was needed to encourage gas fields to be used subsequently, a different tax regime would be required. We are currently looking at the nature of incentives that might be needed and the legislative base within which that could occur.</p>
<p>I am very happy to keep my hon. Friend and the House informed of any developments. The Financial Secretary may be able to provide more details on that. The policy area is at an early stage. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs is considering what the legislative and tax framework would be. While the clause corrects the anomaly, it would not make it more difficult for us to use those fields for carbon capture storage in future. On that basis, I commend the clause to the Committee.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 240, in schedule 25, page 275, line 41, leave out &lsquo;charitable purposes only&rsquo; and insert</p>
<p class="indent">&lsquo;a purpose other than that of private gain (within the meaning of the Gambling Act 2005)&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Clause 104 introduces schedule 25, which provides for amendments to tax legislation as a consequence of, or in connection with, the Gambling Act 2005. When it is fully implemented, the 2005 Act will repeal most of the legislation that provides the regulatory framework for gambling in the UK.</p>
<p>Schedule 25 is divided into six parts. Part 1 provides amendments to the 2005 Act which will preserve the income and corporation tax exemptions that are currently enjoyed by certain charitable lotteries. Part 2 provides for amendments to the Act to be made in respect to general betting and bingo duties. Parts 3 and 4 provide for amendments to lottery and gaming duties. Part 5 deals with other miscellaneous amendments to the Act in relation to bookmakers&rsquo; permits and the definition of a &ldquo;revenue trader&rdquo;. Part 6 makes commencement provisions for those amendments.</p>
<p>Amendment No. 240 modifies the scope of the exemption to gaming duty that is provided by paragraph 17. It ensures that gaming duty is not charged on gaming when players&rsquo; payments are put to a purpose other than for private gain. That very minor change maintains the policy intent of the current legislation and is slightly less restrictive than the exemption in paragraph 17 which would apply when the proceeds of the gaming are used for charitable purposes only. Therefore, I commend the amendment and the schedule to the Committee.</p>

<p> The debate on this clause was prefigured in the debate on clause 11, which the Economic Secretary may remember. That was about vehicle excise duty in relation to non-working vehicles used by people in rural or remote rural areas. This clause concerns working vehicles. As the Financial Secretary reminded us in the debate on clause 11, agricultural vehicles are currently exempt from vehicle excise duty. That inevitably raises the question of when, if at all, a working vehicle becomes a non-working vehicle, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The point was raised on clause 11 by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, who may have a word or two to say about it in a moment. He said:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;My understanding is that previously it&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>the exemption&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;applied to tractors and other very heavy equipment, and the proposed exemption would extend it to 4x4-type vehicles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Financial Secretary replied:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;The sort of detailed discussion that the hon. Gentleman is tempting me to have on this clause is better stayed until we reach clause 105.&rdquo;<span class="italic">&mdash;&mdash;[Official Report, Finance Public Bill Committee,</span> 10 May 2007; c. 99.]</p>
<p>Now we are here, and I hope that we can have the detailed discussion, because were I in a meeting with my local branch of the National Farmers Union, I am sure that its members would be able to provide me with an exhaustive list of circumstances in which 4x4s and other vehicles that might at first sight appear to be non-working vehicles are, in fact, working vehicles. I think that that was the point that my hon. Friend was getting at.</p>
<p>The clause is clearly in the Bill for a purpose. It provides circumstances in which further categories of vehicles can be exempted. Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce measures exempting further classes of vehicles fairly soon? Can the Economic Secretary provide us with a time scale? With reference to the detailed discussion, can he suggest how the Government&rsquo;s thinking on the matter is developing, and whether 4x4s might fall into the relevant category? Finally, will we be able to have a debate about the matter by way of statutory instrument? Will the affirmative rather than the negative procedure be used?</p>

<p> I am pleased that my hon. Friend has reminded the Committee of our debate on clause 11. I could not allow our proceedings to draw to a close without an opportunity to remind members of my entry in the Register of Members&rsquo; Interests, which is in connection with agriculture.</p>
<p>I raised with the Financial Secretary, more in hope than expectation, the question of whether the clause could be used to extend vehicle excise duty relief for agricultural vehicles used solely for the purpose of agriculture, forestry and horticulture. He did not give my hopes much succour, and it is a great shame that he is not here to respond, but I have looked in more detail at the explanatory notes and accept that the aim is to give the Secretary of State flexibility and discretion to redefine tractors and vehicles used for the purpose of agriculture, forestry and horticulture, to reflect technological advance and the development of new machinery in the future.</p>
<p>However, there are two aspects of agricultural practice that need to be drawn out and on which I should like the Economic Secretary to reflect. This is a missed opportunity. As the costs of vehicle excise duty rise&mdash;and they are likely to rise in future, given the environmental and behavioural changes that I think hon. Members on both sides of the House anticipate&mdash;the challenge for the agriculture and forestry industries in particular is that they require a disproportionate use of vehicles just to be in business. That becomes more, rather than less, apparent as mechanisation continues to develop apace. It is no longer the case that a farm gets by with one tractor. A multiplicity of vehicles of different types are used in agriculture. It is therefore entirely appropriate, in my view, that there should be an exemption and that there should continue to be relief from these duties.</p>
<p>The vehicles involved are not only specific-purpose vehicles; they are often adaptations of other vehicles. I think that that is where there is some difficulty with the &nbsp;wide-ranging discretion that the Secretary of State has, and I will come back to that.</p>
<p>The other relevant aspect is that the use of vehicles by these industries is also increasing significantly. That is partly as a result of pressures within the industry to aggregate holdings, and therefore farmers, to continue in business, need to take on other land that is perhaps some way distant from their existing holding. Obviously, they have to use the roads to get to that land. As a result, a lot of vehicles that were previously confined to off-road use are now also being used on-road, and therefore duties might start to apply where they did not previously apply.</p>
<p>For example, many farms use adaptations on quad bikes to provide specialist applications. Quad bikes are not normally registered for road use. However, as Members of Parliament are increasingly aware, they have a number of uses, not least for Members of Parliament. Another example would be motorised hydraulic lift vehicles, such as the well known JCBs. Those are now used for many purposes on farms and must be taken on the roads more than they used to be. It is difficult to see that a description of vehicles can be adequately encompassed to take account of differing uses. It would be a missed opportunity not to use the definition of &ldquo;use of vehicle&rdquo;, rather than just &ldquo;type of vehicle&rdquo;, when it comes to drawing up these exemptions.</p>
<p>Briefly&mdash;Members will be relieved to hear&mdash;clause 105(1) includes the power for the Secretary of State to repeal any of the relevant paragraphs of schedule 2 to the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994. What reassurance can the Economic Secretary give us that he or his colleagues have no intention at present to repeal any of those paragraphs, and that any future attempts to repeal them will be subject to affirmative procedure? Can he also assure us that he supports the arguments that I have outlined in favour of a continuing vehicle excise duty exemption for the industries that I mentioned, all of which have high vehicle use and are, in most cases, trading in fragile circumstances?</p>

<p> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for providing a short history of UK tractors.</p>
<p>I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to proposed new subsection (3)(b), where it refers to:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;vehicles used for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Will he consider whether that list should be extended to vehicles used for conservation purposes? I realise that making such an extension might be tricky, but this is an enabling power that will be given to the Secretary of State. Vehicles that are used for conservation would not be used for purposes relating to agriculture, horticulture or forestry. For example, a vehicle that goes around to pick up great crested newts&mdash;an endangered species that seems to appear on every building site in the west midlands&mdash;would not come within the three categories that are currently listed, but I think that sort of vehicle should have the exemption. This issue needs to be &nbsp;looked at, and the Secretary of State should have the power to include such vehicles in any regulations made under the amended section 5 of the 1994 Act.</p>

<p> For a moment, I thought that I had been remiss by not welcoming the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley to the Committee, but I am told that he has been here before, so there is no need for me to welcome him now. In case I missed his earlier appearance, I apologise.</p>
<p>Agricultural vehicles benefit from exemptions from payment of vehicle excise duty which came into effect from April 2001. The clause gives the Secretary of State for Transport the power to redefine agricultural vehicles within the 1994 Act, for the purposes of maintaining the exemption in good order.</p>
<p>The current definition of an agricultural vehicle within the 1994 Act was established when the distinction between vehicles built for purposes relating to agriculture and vehicles with wider utility was starker, as Opposition Members have pointed out. The agricultural machine taxation class currently covers tractors, light agricultural vehicles and agricultural engines. Examples of the type of light agricultural vehicle treated as eligible for exemption are all train vehicles or quad bikes, and an example of the type of agricultural engine eligible for exemption is a crop sprayer.</p>
<p>As has become clear in our discussions, some vehicles are capable of being used on the land although they are not built primarily or solely for that purpose. That leaves the current definitions open to challenge. I am sure that the Financial Secretary would have liked to be here to carry on the discussions that he promised when we debated clause 11. Sadly, he cannot, and I have the pleasure of leading the debate.</p>
<p>On the Thursday sitting before the recess, when we did not sit in the afternoon, I took the opportunity to travel to Bridgend to meet business leaders and members of the farming community, and this very issue was raised. That preparatory discussion certainly informed my thinking as I prepared for the debate.</p>
<p>To answer the third question asked by the hon. Member for Wycombe, the clause provides for an order-making power that will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The intention is to use the power to achieve firmer definitions and legislative concurrence between the vehicle excise duty exemption and eligibility under the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 for agricultural vehicles to use duty rebate diesel. That will ensure greater clarity, as those who are entitled to license their vehicles as exempt within the agricultural machine taxation class will also be eligible to use red diesel. The definition of an agricultural vehicle under the 1979 Act for the purposes of eligibility to use duty rebate diesel was updated last year by statutory instrument No. 93.</p>
<p>The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is currently discussing the updates of definitions with the industry, and it is actively preparing an order that will, in due course, utilise the power granted by this clause to achieve that legislative concurrence. The agency is also working with HMRC and the industry to issue a memorandum of understanding on which vehicles are eligible for VED exemption and to use duty rebated diesel. It is anticipated that by next spring the Secretary of State for Transport will be in a position to put a &nbsp;draft order before Parliament utilising the flexibility conferred by this clause, to answer the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s first question.</p>
<p>On how the exemptions will apply and whether we intend to introduce any new agricultural vehicle taxation classes or exemptions, there is no intention at this time to introduce a new agricultural vehicle exemption. The work on improving the current agricultural vehicle definitions within the existing exemption is ongoing. Depending on the outcome, there may be scope for the creation of new definitions in line with advances such as technological innovation.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Ludlow asked about off-road vehicles and 4x4s. The Government recognise that four-wheel drive vehicles are used by other businesses, such as professional dry stone wallers and veterinarians, in support of the farming sector, as well as by farmers themselves. There is no intention to introduce an exemption for those who use their four-wheel drive vehicles on the public road. It remains the case that the tax system is designed so that where a vehicle is an essential component of the business activity, businesses can deduct from their turnover all the costs incurred for the sole purpose of generating business profits. Applicable motoring expenses are therefore allowable for deduction against turnover in such circumstances. However, the DVLA is discussing with the industry how the powers conferred by this clause can be used to update the exemption.</p>
<p>A separate exemption already exists for vehicles, including four-wheel drives, that are used mainly on the land. That exemption applies where vehicles are used between different parts of the land in agriculture, horticulture and forestry. It is available where a vehicle is used on the public road only to pass between different areas of land occupied by the same person for a distance of no more than 1.5 km. Provided that that condition is met, vehicles including four-wheel drives that are not otherwise eligible for exemption under the agricultural machine taxation class may be eligible for exemption. The DVLA is consulting industry representatives about updating the definition and to ensure that the proposals reflectlast year&rsquo;s administrative changes on hydrocarbon oil duty.</p>

<p> The suggestion that a 1.5 km limit should apply to the eligibility that the Economic Secretary described seems somewhat perverse. Many contractors, particularly in agriculture, may have to travel many miles, even tens of miles, on public roads to get from one piece of ground to another. I earnestly urge him to discuss that with the industry and to reconsider the limit.</p>

<p> The point that I was making was that the 1.5 km limit is available in existing definitions. We are discussing with the industry how to ensure that the clause provides flexibility for vehicles, including 4x4s, that are genuinely used for agricultural purposes rather than on-road driving. The purpose of the consultation is precisely to ensure that we do not allow tax relief for normal public, on-road driving, but that we provide the flexibility that the farming community needs.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Ludlow asked whether any of the current taxation classes will be repealed. That is not &nbsp;our intention. The clause&rsquo;s purpose is to ensure that legislation remains current and relevant, and that only vehicles that are legitimately entitled to the exemption are licensed in the agricultural categories. There are no plans to remove any of the existing exemptions. Our intention is only to improve and update, and to include revised definitions for agricultural vehicles in accordance with new technological developments.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the changes will put existing users outside the exemption. Clearly, we are trying to reduce the ambiguity in the definitions to enable the agricultural industry to continue to benefit from legitimate exemptions while discouraging unfair competition. The definitions will be carefully framed and will be discussed with stakeholders and businesses to avoid imposing an unnecessary compliance burden. We do not intend to penalise those who already qualify legitimately to license their vehicles in the agricultural machinery taxation class.</p>
<p>I am sure that the matters that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West raised will be firmly in the mind of my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and other Ministers as they take forward our wider agenda to promote conservation and a reduction in climate change. I will ensure that the Financial Secretary is fully aware of the question that he asked. It goes wider than the clause, but it is important. If I can update him on any issues, I shall ensure that they are included in an addendum to the previous letter.</p>

<p> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Gale.</p>
<p>I have considerable sympathy with what the Government are seeking to do in the clause. I have made it clear on a number of occasions&mdash;sometimes in this very room&mdash;that I am concerned about the impact of the European Court of Justice&rsquo;s judgments on our tax system and the revenues collected by the Exchequer. I am not asserting that there is necessarily any causal connection between the clause and recent decisions by the court, but there seems to be little doubt that the damage done to tax revenues as a result of ECJ decisions will be reduced if the clause is adopted.</p>
<p>I appreciate that a great deal of money is at stake, and I am happy to support effective and reasonable measures to protect that revenue. However, I am worried that the clause may simply land the Government back in the ECJ. Furthermore, it is important for the Committee to take a few minutes to consider the concerns about the retroactive removal of a right to reclaim taxes paid because they were not lawfully due. The Minister who is dealing with the matter will be well aware that various professional bodies believe that the clause is inconsistent with European law, and in particular that it would contravene the principle of effectiveness. That principle &nbsp;provides that member states are not permitted to render rights conferred by community law that are impossible or excessively difficult to exercise.</p>
<p>The concerns of organisations such as the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales revolve around the ECJ judgment in Marks and Spencer <span class="italic">v.</span> Customs and Excise in 2002. The ECJ considered whether the curtailment of limitation periods could be compatible with the principle of effectiveness. It decided that such curtailments could be compatible with Community law as long as certain conditions were complied with. The first condition is set out in paragraph 36 of the judgment, which states that the relevant change to limitation periods</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;must not be intended specifically to limit the consequences of a judgment of the Court to the effect that national legislation concerning a specific tax is incompatible with Community law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is certainly a perceived link&mdash;I stress that it is perceived rather than definitely established&mdash;between clause 106 and the judgment in the Metallgesellschaft-Hoechst case and the follow-up litigation in Deutsche Morgan Grenfell <span class="italic">v. </span>Inland Revenue, although the direct claimants in that case will not, of course, be affected by the clause. Will the Minister give the firm assurance that the provision in Community law to which I referred does not cause a problem in relation to clause 106? It would be useful if he outlined the reasons for his view on that. In particular, to what extent do the Government&rsquo;s references to the large sums at stake encompass taxes paid under a mistaken law that do not relate to the Hoechst case or other ECJ jurisprudence? If, for example, the clause had a range of situations rather than just the Hoechst case in mind, it might assist in satisfying the condition to which I referred, and in answering the concerns arising from that point of European law.</p>
<p>The second condition set out in the Marks and Spencer case is that</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;the new limitation period is reasonable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Government should be able to deploy some attractive arguments on that point, given that the six-year limitation period in the clause is in widespread use in our law. The explanatory notes on the Bill refer to the clause achieving symmetry with the period during which the Revenue can collect back taxes, which could be used to strengthen the argument that the period is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. However, it is worth noting that in cases of negligent conduct, HMRC can go back 20 years to collect back taxes, which detracts from the strength of the symmetry argument.</p>
<p>The Government hopefully might find themselves on reasonably firm ground on the reasonableness condition, but there might be a problem with the third requirement laid down by the ECJ in the Marks and Spencer case. Paragraph 38 of the judgment required that legislation containing revised limitation periods must include</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;transitional arrangements allowing an adequate period after the enactment of the legislation for lodging the claims for repayment which persons were entitled to submit under the original legislation. Such transitional arrangements are necessary where &nbsp;the immediate application to those claims of a limitation period shorter than that which was previously in force would have the effect of retroactively depriving some individuals of their right to repayment, or of allowing them too short a period for asserting that right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Committee will see that there are no transitional arrangements in the clause, so it would seem that that aspect of the Marks and Spencer case poses a problem. The concern becomes more marked when one takes into account the way in which the Marks and Spencer case was interpreted and applied in subsequent cases such as Grundig Italiana <span class="italic">v.</span> Ministry of Finance. In that case, the ECJ concluded that</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;the transitional period must be sufficient to allow taxpayers who initially thought that the old period for bringing proceedings was available to them a reasonable period of time to assert their right of recovery in the event that, under the new rules, they would already be out of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be useful if the Chief Secretary to the Treasury gave the Committee a clear assurance that clause 106 does not fall foul of the principle that a transitional period is required as is set out in the Marks and Spencer judgment. Is he able to distinguish the Marks and Spencer and Grundig Italiana cases and to explain why they do not apply in relation to clause 106? Alternatively, will he provide a justification that would override the application of the principle set out in those cases? Is there any scope for arguing that exceptional circumstances, within the meaning of Stichting &ldquo;Goed Wonen&rdquo; <span class="italic">v.</span> Staatssecretaris, apply in this case to justify the withdrawal of an entitlement to repayment?</p>
<p>It would also be useful if the Chief Secretary allayed the concerns raised by representative organisations about the principle of legitimate expectations as a part of Community law. In paragraph 46 of the Marks and Spencer judgment, the ECJ held, in the context of a breach of the sixth VAT directive, that the principle of legitimate expectations could apply</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;so as to preclude a national legislative amendment which retroactively deprives a taxable person of the right enjoyed prior to that amendment to obtain repayment of taxes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is useful to refer to the opinion provided to the Law Society by Mr. Philip Baker, QC, who is convinced that the principle of legitimate expectation applies to clause 106. He raised a particular concern about section 320 of the Finance Act 2004, which restricts claims for the repayment of taxes on the basis of mistake of law but explicitly excludes litigation that commenced before 8 September 2003. He argues:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Any person having commenced an action before that date might reasonably have expected that they could continue their action until final judgment without further legislative intervention. Litigants will have continued to pursue claims (commenced prior to 8th September 2003) on the basis of that expectation and will have incurred costs in so doing. In a sense, the Finance Act 2004 legislation would have enhanced the legitimate expectations of those who had commenced their actions before 8th September 2003&rdquo;</p>
<p>that they would be able to continue them.</p>
<p>Will the Minister assure the Committee that he does not believe that clause 106 infringes the principle of legitimate expectations, and give us his reasons for holding that view? Will he address in particular the point about the sums that have been expended on litigation by affected parties, and the point that has been made by some representative bodies about the number of affected taxpayers who might have chosen to &nbsp;join the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell litigation had they been aware that the law might be changed retroactively? I hope that he will reassure the Committee regarding the points and questions that I have raised.</p>

<p> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and to entertain the Economic Secretary, who obviously did not notice me on the previous occasions that I attended, because I have not spoken all that much.</p>
<p>The clause is rather weird. Without going into all the details of the constitutional legislation that it may infringe, such as the European Communities Act 1972 and the Human Rights Act 1998, as well as the traditional issues of judicial review and the grounds on which challenges can be brought, there is one particular weirdness in it that I want to highlight. Suppose that someone has sued the Government, because they made a mistake, and won the case. The idea of passing legislation that reverses the judgment and provides that that person has to pay back the money and all the costs on both sides, with interest, which is basically what subsection (4) says, is quite odd. It is a strange idea that when someone has won a legal case, the whole thing can then be reversed through statute.</p>
<p>There is a substantial argument for drawing a line after six years and moving on, in terms of dealing with tax&mdash;there has to be some sort of symmetry&mdash;but the idea of reversing judgments through statutes, without any consideration of costs, has to be a strange one. Someone has won a case and got their costs, and now we are saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost the case and you&rsquo;ve got to pay the money back, with interest,&rdquo; although the rate is not specified. We are saying, &ldquo;Obviously, if you&rsquo;ve lost the case, you have to pay the costs.&rdquo; That is absurd. Of course, we are not going to divide on this, but the Government should respond regarding the idea of reversing judgments.</p>

<p> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr. Gale, and I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire on his promotion to the Front Bench.</p>
<p>I am pleased that the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet supports the Government&rsquo;s intention in the clause and, in a moment, I shall provide some reassurance and clarification on the point raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley.</p>
<p>Our purpose here is to ensure that the limitation period in which to make a claim for the recovery of direct tax paid by reason of mistaken law is six years from the date of payment. That follows a House of Lords judgment on 25 October last year in Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc <span class="italic">v. </span>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs. The Lords held that in certain circumstances the limitation period for claims does not begin until the claimant has discovered the mistake, which means that restitution is due in some cases for payments made more than three decades ago. As we have discussed, interest might be due on those payments as well.</p>
<p>That judgment leaves the Government facing potential repayments of very large sums in other cases, &nbsp;which means that the general populous might pay a price through higher taxes or reduced public spending for a disproportionate benefit to a small number of groups and companies. In 2004, legislation was introduced to protect the Exchequer from new claims arising on or after 8 September 2003. We are acting now on claims made before that date to protect the wider public interest.</p>
<p>The clause ensures that a six-year limitation period applies from the date of payment. In other words, the payment groups affected will still be entitled to six year&rsquo;s worth of repayments. That strikes a fair balance, familiar to other parts of the legislation, as the hon. Lady rightly said, between the general interest of the community and the protection of the rights of claimants. It goes some way, as well, to restoring the general symmetry thought to exist between the rights of claimants to recover overpaid tax and those of HMRC to recover underpaid tax.</p>
<p>To clarify the point raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley, the clause will not affect the claimant in the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell case, as the hon. Lady acknowledged, or other claimants for whom that claim was a test case. The clause affects other cases and will ensure that a fair and proportionate limitation period of six years applies from the date of payment.</p>
<p>There have been widespread discussions about a transitional provision, which was raised by the hon. Lady. However, that misses the point of the clause. I imagine that the purpose of a transitional provision is to allow for an extra period in which claims can be made under the previous system. However, the clause affects claims made before 8 September 2003 only. In other words, all of the claims affected by the clause have been made already. I do not think, therefore, that providing for a transitional period in the clause would have any meaning.</p>
<p>It is my clear view that the clause is compatible with the European convention on human rights and strikes the right balance between the interests of the general taxpayer and the claimant companies. We are absolutely confident that it is proper to legislate in this way and we would defend robustly any challenge to the legislation in the courts. It is important to affirm that limitation periods are a matter for national legislation. Claimant groups affected by the measure will still be entitled to six year&rsquo;s worth of repayments.</p>
<p>The hon. Lady raised a question about people who might have acted differently in the past. I am not sure that there is any great value in speculating about what others might have done in the past. Given the amount of revenue at stake, as she acknowledged, it is very important that the Government take action. The House of Lords judgment in the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell case was made prior to the announcement of the measure before us. We are aiming simply to put things right by ensuring that those claimants bound by that judgment under the terms of the group litigation are unaffected by the legislation, as I have explained. I hope that the clause will find favour with the Committee.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 118, in schedule 26, page 281, line 17, at end insert&mdash;</p>

<p>Schedule 26 amends the legislation defining a recognised stock exchange to enable a more competitive market. It will also modernise the rules and definitions to provide greater clarity and consistency. Current rules do not permit the extension of recognised status to any UK stock exchange other than the London stock exchange. The measure will ensure equal tax treatment for Financial Services Authority listed shares regardless of which recognised investment exchange is used as the primary market.</p>
<p>Amendment No. 118 will ensure that all known consequential amendments have been made. As I said, the legislation&rsquo;s aim is to ensure competition for markets and to modernise the terminology used. This consequential amendment, which was omitted from the original list, should now be included. If it is not added to the list, it could create uncertainty for the industry and unnecessary administrative burdens in clarifying that there is no essential difference between &ldquo;quoted&rdquo; and &ldquo;listed&rdquo; for the purpose of schedule 26. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</p>

<p> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
<p>The new clause aims to deal with quite a serious problem that has arisen for the UK&rsquo;s investment and legal services industry as a result of changes made to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 by last year&rsquo;s Finance Act. The new clause would reverse one of the changes that the 2006 Act made regarding &nbsp;determination whether a trustee is resident in the UK or overseas by restoring the definition that operated until 7 April this year.</p>
<p>According to a note published on Tuesday by the technical committee of the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, the new formulation introduced last year has</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;given rise to widespread uncertainty and difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Law Society have also expressed support for new clause 2 and the points made by STEP. Strong concern has been conveyed to me by the representative bodies that HMRC has not yet treated the issue seriously enough. That is a worry, considering that the provisions came into force in April this year. One of the reasons that I have tabled the new clause is to ensure that the points expressed by concerned professionals are listened to and properly and fully explored.</p>
<p>Under the old rules, no problem arose where foreign trustees delegated a number of services relating to trusts to subsidiary firms or affiliates in the UK. The rule was that a trust was resident in the UK unless two conditions were satisfied: first, that the majority of trustees were non-resident, and secondly, that the general administration of the trust was ordinarily performed outside the UK.</p>
<p>However, the 2006 Act introduced a number of changes to the test for whether a trustee is resident or non-resident. One of those was the insertion of a new section 69(2D) into the TCGA to provide that</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;A trustee who is not resident in the United Kingdom shall be treated for the purposes of subsections (2A) and (2B) as if he were resident in the United Kingdom at any time when he acts as trustee in the course of a business which he carries on in the United Kingdom through a branch, agency or permanent establishment there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As STEP explains in the note to which I have already referred, the difficulty with section 69(2D) is the scope of the words</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;branch, agency or permanent establishment&rdquo;,</p>
<p>which it regards as unclear and broad.</p>
<p>The first problem is whether all three terms apply to both corporate and non-corporate trustees. Other legislation with similar provisions has, I understand, tended to apply the &ldquo;branch or agency test&rdquo; to individuals and the permanent establishment test to companies. If the Economic Secretary gave us his view on that, it could provide some welcome clarification for those grappling with the legislation. However, even if this matter is resolved, the meaning of the three concepts remains unclear. We are dependent on case law, much of which is relatively old, for the meaning of &ldquo;branch&rdquo; or &ldquo;agency&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Assistance on determining what amounts to a permanent establishment is found in section 148 of the Finance Act 2003 and in article 5 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model tax convention on income and capital, both of which refer to the concept of a &ldquo;fixed place of business&rdquo;. That seems particularly relevant to the issues that the Committee is considering.</p>
<p>The approach suggested by the commentary onarticle 5 of the OECD convention indicates that an overseas enterprise must have unrestricted ability to use premises in the UK before those are capable of constituting &nbsp;a fixed place of business. I have been advised that a number of activities carried on by non-resident trustees, which have caused no problem in the past, could arguably now give rise to the conclusion that a fixed place of business is being used and a permanent establishment has been set up within the meaning of section 69(2D). I have to stress that it is not clear that such activities would bring a trustee under the terms of section 69(2D), but there is a substantial risk that they would. That is certainly the advice that such people are receiving from their legal advisers. Activities at issue, include the regular use of office premises of a UK affiliate for discussions with professional advisers and other meetings that are, perhaps, incidental to the management of the trust and its investments. Another problem area is the use of a UK affiliate&rsquo;s accountancy services in preparing trust accounts. That could cause a problem, as could the use of an affiliate&rsquo;s investment management services. The risk remains even where the services and facilities are provided by the UK affiliate at a market rate and on arm&rsquo;s-length terms.</p>
<p>The consequences of a trustee falling within section 69(2D) and inadvertently becoming UK resident are serious. Put simply, non-resident trustees who use UK affiliates to carry out any back-office functions now risk bringing their trust within the UK tax net when it would not otherwise be so. The trust would therefore be within the scope of UK capital gains tax on all future gains. The gravity of the problem becomes even more apparent when one takes into account the fact that there is no CGT uplift where a trust becomes UK resident. That means that all gains are taxable on future disposals, including those accrued before the trust became UK resident.</p>

<p> I bow to the hon. Lady&rsquo;s much superior knowledge on this matter, but on reading the amendment and listening to her it appears, prima facie, that she is arguing for a tax break for the rich who have gone offshore. Is that so?</p>

<p> No, it is not. Just to pre-empt any misunderstanding on what section 69(2D) is about, I make it clear that I do not think it is about anti-avoidance. Obviously, we will hear from the Economic Secretary, but there is, correctly in my view, extensive legislation in place already to prevent UK residents from using offshore structures&mdash;whether trusts or anything else&mdash;to reduce their tax bill. It is right that we have that legislation. If there are any remaining gaps in that anti-avoidance legislation, I would support the Government in plugging them. However, I am not persuaded that this measure is aimed at that problem.</p>
<p>We are talking about whether the UK can retain a share in international trust business, which is an important professional services market provided to people from overseas setting up international trusts. It is not primarily, or really at all, about UK residents. The current anti-avoidance provisions are effective. This is an international industry providing services to people who usually have little or no connection with the UK. Again, I would be interested to hear what the Economic Secretary has to say. He may be able to explain the anti-avoidance aspect.</p>
<p>I pick up where I left off. If the trustees fall under section 69(2D), they cannot solve the problem by &nbsp;becoming non-resident; if they do, all unrealised gains would become chargeable. In its note of 5 June, STEP says:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Non-UK trustees will not take the chance of being deemed to be UK resident and work which would otherwise come to UK professionals would be sent elsewhere...And business once lost is hard to regain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to give serious consideration to that warning.</p>
<p>The Opposition fear that the adoption of a permanent establishment test is inappropriate. It seems to have been lifted from corporation tax rules, which provide that when a non-UK company carries on business in the UK through a permanent establishment, the company will be taxed on profits earned through the permanent establishment. That seems reasonable. However, lifting the terminology into the context of trusts will have serious and far-reaching results, although I suspect that they may be unintended. If a trustee oversteps the mark only marginally, so that his activities come within the scope of the permanent establishment test, it would cause the trust to be UK-resident for all purposes&mdash;all the gains that it made and all its income, whether connected with the UK or not, would be liable.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-05-08_FIN_14-0_2007-06-07a.8.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" speakername="Adam Afriyie" time="13:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/finance/070607/pm/70607s03.htm#07060783000136" colnum="516">
<p> It strikes me that the Government recognise the international competition in corporation tax rates, and to ensure that the UK remains effective, they have reduced them by 2 per cent. There is international competition also in the provision of services to those who support and provide services for international trusts. Does my hon. Friend agree that we run the risk of losing those businesses if the provision goes through as it is?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-05-08_FIN_14-0_2007-06-07a.8.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" speakername="Theresa Villiers" time="13:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/finance/070607/pm/70607s04.htm" colnum="516">
<p> I agree. My concern is that our competitiveness will be undermined, but no clear reason has been given as to why that step was taken in last year&rsquo;s Finance Act. There may be a good reason for UK jobs being lost&mdash;it may be worth the price&mdash;but I am not yet persuaded of the justification for making the change.</p>
<p>I turn again to the consequences of section 69(2D) remaining unamended. If one took the same approach to international companies as the 2006 Act applies to international trusts, companies that carried out only a few back-office functions in the UK would have all their worldwide profits and property dealt with under the UK tax system. That would be nonsense for companies, and it is causing a problem in the trust context. All the gains of trusts would be taxed here, even if they became resident here for only one day.</p>
<p>New clause 2 seeks merely to restore the general administration test that applied up until the Finance Act 2006. Not many would assert that the old test was perfect&mdash;it had some well-known drawbacks&mdash;but it proved to be workable for the 40 years that it was in operation. There seems to be a degree of confidence in the test, given that it operated well in most circumstances. Whatever interpretative problems there might have been were significantly less serious than the concerns centred on section 69(2D).</p>
<p>Issuing HMRC guidance is not the answer. Although further guidance on what the provision means&mdash;from HMRC, or indeed from the Economic Secretary this afternoon&mdash;would be welcome, it would not resolve all &nbsp;the uncertainties. It would provide insufficient protection for trustees, given the significant liabilities involved if a trustee inadvertently brought the trust within the UK tax net. Even if HMRC stated clearly that none of the back-office functions that I have outlined would trigger the operation of section 69(2D), the result would still be less than satisfactory. In effect, the outcome would be that trusts having no connection with the UK would be liable for UK tax under section 69(2D), but would be let off&mdash;essentially at the Revenue&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p>We should remember that almost all trustees would be personally liable for the extra tax that the trust had to pay as a result of changing residence. Professionals would not take that risk. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor pointed out, the change in the law made under last year&rsquo;s Finance Act has significantly undermined the UK&rsquo;s ability to compete in the market for international trust business. I am informed that the change is already leading to jobs being lost in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that thus far my evidence is anecdotal, but I have received a number of reports of accounting services being shifted offshore with data inputting going to Bangalore and investment services going to Geneva. For example, I have been informed that, following a meeting with the Revenue to discuss the issue, one of the industry representatives went straight back to his office afterwards and issued redundancy notices to six bookkeepers on the spot and put in place measures to close within six months the facilities that he used in London with a loss of 40 jobs in total.</p>
<p>We have special expertise in trust matters in the United Kingdom. After all, it was an English invention. I shall spare the Committee my treatise on the cultural jurisprudential importance of trust business, given that it received it several times last year. The expertise has given us a significant edge when competing for international trust business. It is a large industry. It is a highly competitive and mobile area of the international market for professional services. I am told that our competitors overseas are delighted at the developments in our law and are advising their clients not to use the UK for any trust-related services. A significant number of jobs in the UK depend on the business and they are being put in jeopardy for no good reason.</p>
<p>We now reach the key point, to which I referred in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor. It is simply not clear why the change to the definition was made. If section 69(2D) was performing an important anti-avoidance function, perhaps it would not matter if it meant that jobs were lost in the UK and offshored to India and Switzerland.</p>
<p>I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause. If not, I hope that he will consider rectifying the matter on Report or at some future stage. Failing that, he should at least explain why section 69(2D) is necessary and say what important function it is performing, because I cannot see what it is.</p>
<p>The STEP technical committee appealed that</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;the permanent establishment test needs to be urgently reconsidered&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I hope that the Minister will give us a commitment that he will do as it asked.</p>

<p> I know that the hon. Lady has expertise and a detailed interest in trust matters. The tax rules for determining trustee residency were amended under the Finance Act 2006 as part of the trusts modernisation package. The new regime took effect from 6 April 2007. The new clause would amend the changes to trust residency that were made into legislation last year. As she explained, the 2006 legislation replaced separate income tax and capital gains tax residency tests with a common test to ensure that all trustees have the same residence status for income tax and capital gains tax purposes to make it easier to comply with the tax system for trusts. The changes also dealt with concerns that professional trustees in overseas institutions were able to develop a substantive UK presence while remaining non-resident for tax purposes.</p>
<p>The new residency test was introduced in the Finance Act 2006, but we made it effective from April this year as we wanted to give trustees time to reorder their affairs to retain the residence status that they wanted and to avoid complex transitional provisions. There was considerable consultation and time to prepare for such matters, and I am not sure whether the employment practices described by the hon. Lady in one instance are really the sort that any member of the Committee would condone.</p>

<p> It strikes me that the Economic Secretary is casting aside some of the genuine concerns about the UK&rsquo;s loss of competitiveness in the industry. Will he lay out the research on which he based his statements? How many people does he estimate will be affected by the changes?</p>

<p> Given that I have not even said whether we will accept the new clause, but have just stated what has happened during the past year, the hon. Gentleman is jumping to conclusions. If he gives me the opportunity to make my speech, perhaps he will then know whether I have addressed that question.</p>
<p>The new common residency test is based on the old income tax test. It was chosen because it provides a simpler and clearer test to determine the residence position of the trustees as a body. It includes a provision that a non-resident trustee will be treated as a resident trustee for tax purposes when he or she acts as a trustee in the course of a business carried on through a UK branch, agency or permanent establishment.</p>
<p>We are aware that the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners&mdash;STEP&mdash;the body that organises on behalf of the practitioners, has expressed concern about the permanent establishment test, and in particular its potential effect on non-resident corporate trustees. I understand that such trustees may well have an associated company in the UK whose offices are made available for meetings with settlors, beneficiaries or investment advisers or which are used as a base for other UK operations. The legitimate concern appears to be that such activity could result in non-resident corporate trustees doing business in the UK losing their non-resident tax status.</p>
<p>The Committee will be pleased to learn that HMRC is engaged in ongoing discussions with STEP on that matter. Whether trustees will be regarded as having a permanent establishment in the UK will depend on the circumstances in each case and the extent to which that is legitimate. To provide as much help as possible for taxpayers, following those consultations, which have involved STEP and other practitioners for some time, HMRC will, as a priority, issue guidance on the new rules to ensure that legitimate business is not being captured. People engaged in legitimate business would be better off waiting until the consultation has ended and the guidance has been issued before they issue redundancy notices.</p>
<p>As part of the work on guidance, HMRC is carrying out detailed analysis of the issues raised by STEP to ascertain the nature and extent of any issues affecting non-resident corporate trustees. This is a complex area that requires detailed discussion. The discussions are ongoing, and once the analysis has been completed and studied carefully by HMRC, we shall issue guidance. We shall not issue it until we have reached conclusions, and no firm conclusions have yet been reached.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the trusts modernisation legislation in the Finance Act 2006, including the new residency test, was consulted on twice before it was introduced. Although many respondents, including STEP, agreed that a common test was desirable, they expressed a preference for a rule different from that eventually introduced. I have set out that for the purposes of simplicity, and to ensure that proper practice was supported and illegitimate practice was not, we legislated as we did.</p>

<p> I hope that the Economic Secretary will not jump down my throat as he did when I made a genuine inquiry about why he did not appear to be concerned about the competitiveness of the sector, but his comments once again seem to cast aspersions on anybody who makes a decision to close their operations in the UK before the guidance is issued. It is not wise, in an area of uncertainty, given that the repercussions are enormous for businesses, for them to make decisions early, even if there is no certainty about whether the decision is the right one in view of when the guidance is issued? Such an approach would seem to be sensible, as opposed to being a dodgy thing to do, as he seems to be suggesting.</p>

<p> It is not for me to second-guess the business decisions of any individual company agency, and the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet did not tell us the precise circumstances. Our intention is to ensure that people who are acting as offshore trustees but who, for other purposes, legitimately have business dealings, and therefore premises, in the UK are not unfairly discriminated against by any change. Consultation and detailed discussion is taking place, so anybody who is acting within the intent of the law will not be unfairly impacted by these matters, whereas people who are clearly seeking to use the arrangements to avoid tax will be.</p>
<p>I say to the hon. Lady and to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West that in this complex area there is the potential for considerable tax avoidance. We do not intend to allow that avoidance to occur. At the same time, the purpose of the consultation &nbsp;is to ensure proper and detailed guidance, so that people are not unfairly and unintentionally caught by the definition.</p>
<p>The hon. Lady asked whether the definitions apply equally to corporate and non-corporate trustees, to which the answer is that branch, agency and permanent establishment applies to both. She also asked about the OECD test, which is used for working out the definitions of permanent establishment for corporation tax purposes. She is right: the OECD manual has the best definition, which sets out what is meant by permanent establishment. Although the examples given in that manual relate to companies, which is normal because most OECD members do not legislate for trusts, the conclusions can be adapted for trust business. The analysis that HMRC is preparing will examine the definition and how it can be applied to trusts. HMRC will share that analysis with STEP in the coming weeks as it consults on the detailed guidance to which I have referred.</p>
<p>The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Windsor asked whether we are setting out to damage the competitiveness of the UK as a financial centre. No, we absolutely are not; we always intend to ensure that London maintains its competitiveness as a global financial centre, across a range of tax regulatory matters. London is highly respected around the world as a global financial centre partly because it is a well-regulated, proper place to do business, whose rules, legal system and tax system require high standards of integrity and probity. It is important that there is no ambiguity, which can send the wrong kind of messages. We have no intention of doing anything to damage our competitiveness, but we need to get the measures right.</p>
<p>STEP has provided HMRC with individual cases in which it believes people have been unfairly caught. HMRC is studying the analysis of those examples as it draws up the guidance. I have no statistics on the extent of the potential tax avoidance, but our integrity and probity depend on us taking a robust approach towards it. Many opportunities for tax avoidance in this area can be prevented.</p>

<p> If the hon. Lady would let me answer her previous point, that might help her to prepare her next intervention. It is not our job to lead the tax avoidance industry down such a road. There are many sophisticated lawyers and accountants; many of them work in legitimate business areas, but some of them seek ways in which the law can be pressed in a particular direction. HMRC judges that this issue could present many opportunities for tax avoidance, and that it would be wrong for the Government to take measures that would further support and advantage the offshore trust industry. That is not our intention. As I have explained, the purpose of the consultation is to produce guidance that will not damage in any way the legitimate offshore trust industry.</p>

<p> To take the hon. Gentleman back to the beginning of my speech, we legislated for the measure in last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill, not this year&rsquo;s. We legislated following two lengthy consultations, and we justified fully at the time why, in order to simplify the tax system, to create a definition common to income and capital gains and to ensure that we properly supported the legitimate business of offshore trust practitioners without allowing people to get around the rules, that was the better way to go.</p>

<p> Let me answer the point and then I shall take another intervention.</p>
<p>STEP and some advisors put it to us that in the early weeks of the measure&rsquo;s eight-week implementation period, which began in April, some people feared that the way it was being implemented could impact on legitimate business. The right thing to do when those fears&mdash;including specific case studies&mdash;are raised is to begin discussions immediately. I have made it clear that discussions are ongoing. There will be full consultation and we will issue guidance to ensure that legitimate business is not affected, while preventing tax avoidance by people claiming to be offshore and for tax purposes a trustee, but who have premises to do effectively the same business here in the UK. We were clear last year that we would not condone it. The right thing to do is to consult and to come forward with guidance. My argument is that it would be premature to pass a new clause that took us back to where we were before last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill when we are still consulting to ensure the right guidance. I am happy if the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene again.</p>

<p> To be fair, that is a more substantial argument, but the Economic Secretary argued earlier that the new clause would allow opportunities for tax evasion and he did not cite any such opportunities. The point is that the new clause has not been passed, so the opportunities do not exist. However, there is a different argument that the objective could be achieved through guidance. That is an arguable case, whereas the other case is not. Whether it is a true case is another question.</p>

<p> To repeat what I said: we acted last year because we feared that without the change, there would &nbsp;be complexity and potential avoidance. We have consulted and acted, but to ensure that legitimate business outside the intentions of the Finance Act 2006 is not unfairly caught, we are consulting to produce guidance. My argument is that it would be premature to legislate today to return us to where we were before last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill when we are still consulting on detailed guidance to ensure that the intentions of the 2006 Act are properly implemented. On the basis of eight weeks&rsquo; experience, it would be a premature decision.</p>
<p>STEP has a choice. It can either brief shadow Ministers to try to reverse legislation that the House has enacted, or it can engage in detailed consultation with HMRC to ensure that its legitimate concerns&mdash;</p>

<p> Hang on. Let me just finish my point.</p>
<p>STEP can engage in detailed consultation with HMRC to ensure that its legitimate concerns are properly addressed. The consultation is ongoing, and STEP and the practitioners would be better off engaging in the consultations, working with us on the guidance and through the examples and deciding at the end of that process whether it provides them with the clarity that they want, rather than supporting a return to the status quo ex ante.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-05-08_FIN_14-0_2007-06-07a.8.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" speakername="Theresa Villiers" time="14:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/finance/070607/pm/70607s05.htm#07060783000180" colnum="522">
<p> STEP has engaged in extensive correspondence and discussions with HMRC, but I should like to ask the Economic Secretary whether he is threatening the professional organisations and saying that they should not engage in discussions with the Opposition, because that seems to be a wholly undemocratic approach.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-05-08_FIN_14-0_2007-06-07a.8.28" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" time="14:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/finance/070607/pm/70607s05.htm#07060783000181" colnum="522">
<p> To an extent I understand the point, but I disagree with it. My point was that STEP and the practitioners have a choice. They can either engage positively and constructively to get the guidance right, or they can walk away from the whole process and call for the legislation to be repealed. The former option is a better approach. The latter, at this stage, would be premature. However, I can see why they are going to run with both options.</p>
<p>My view is that the detailed consultation is the right approach. Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject new clause 2 because I think that it is both premature and mistaken. It is not the right way to go. If, after the consultations, STEP concludes that it is satisfied with the guidance, it can encourage the Opposition to come forward with further amendments to future Finance Bills. To do so now, while we are in the middle of a consultation, is a mistake. Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject the new clause.</p>

<p> We have had this system in place for eight weeks. This Finance Bill will be implemented in about a year, so the consequences of the status quo will be fully impacted by the time there is another Finance Bill. There is an opportunity to change it now. If guidance does not facilitate dealing with the issue, it will be too late in a year&rsquo;s time. We are not going to hang around.</p>

<p> Frankly, I am shocked by the exchange we have just had. It is outrageous for the Economic Secretary to say that representative bodies, or anyone who is interested in democratic scrutiny of our tax legislation, face the choice of either engaging constructively with the Treasury and HMRC, or briefing and advising the Opposition on amendments. That demonstrates contempt for the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations and I think it is regrettable that the Economic Secretary made those comments.</p>

<p> I never suggested that STEP had briefed the hon. Lady on an amendment. I said that it had briefed the hon. Lady on a new clause to reverse last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill and therefore to reverse the very piece of legislation on which we are currently engaged in a consultation to provide guidance. That is quite different from an amendment. The question is, do we go back to where we were before 2006, or do we make the consultation process work? All I was saying was that it was better to consult to provide decent guidance to avoid the concerns of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley. That seems to be a more constructive approach to making tax policy.</p>

<p> I fail to see how it can be incompatible to engage in the closest, extensive and most constructive negotiations with HMRC and at the same time advise and express concerns to Opposition spokesmen. Any suggestion that those two are incompatible is fundamentally undemocratic and show insufficient regard for the process in which we have been engaged for three months.</p>
<p>It is also regrettable that the Economic Secretary could not answer either of my questions. He could produce no examples of avoidance schemes that would be shut down as a result of section 69(2D). He was unable to give evidence of any avoidance that had occurred as a result of the old test, which has been in operation for 40 years and which new clause 2 would restore. He emphasised that it was important not to have ambiguity because it sends out the wrong signals in our law. Well, we have ambiguity that sends the signal that the UK is no longer open for this type of business. I am willing to bet that people will receive redundancy notices as a result of the discussion that we have had in Committee and the Economic Secretary&rsquo;s remarks today.</p>
<p>The Economic Secretary also made it plain that the decision on the permanent establishment case would depend on the circumstances of each case. That again confirms the uncertainty to which trustees are subjected. They have no way of telling in advance whether their case will be affected by the provisions. I am pleased that he said that attention was now being directed to this matter with HMRC. I hope that that attention will be directed to the issue as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p> No.</p>
<p>The Economic Secretary said that it would be premature to act now. People are losing their jobs right now as a result of this legislation. That is why I tabled &nbsp;new clause 2. I will not press it to a vote, because I tabled it in order to draw this serious problem to the attention of Ministers and officials. I am grateful that the Economic Secretary is going to carry out further consultation. He refers to a consultation happening at the moment. So far as I am aware, there is no formal consultation going on. However, I understand his words to mean that there will be a formal consultation, and I hope that he will move to resolve the issue as a matter of urgency. I remain convinced that it will not be possible to resolve it with any certainty or finality until we have a legislative change. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

<p> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Before we come to the end of our arduous labours, may I put on the record my thanks to you and to your co-Chairman, Mr. Illsley, for your stewardship and assistance. You have ably and skilfully guided us through these complex debates. Let me also take the opportunity to thank the Clerks, the Hansard writers, the Doorkeepers and the police officers for their assured touch in ensuring that the business of the Committee has run smoothly, and for all the help that they have given to members of the Committee.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet confessed, perhaps inadvertently, on Tuesday that as a Member of the European Parliament, she worked with the Treasury on European regulations on financial services. I confirm the accuracy of her confession, although those happy days may have seemed a little distant from time to time in the cut and thrust of debate in this Committee. I congratulate the hon. Lady, the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, who is represented today by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley, the hon. Member for Dundee, East, who I am pleased to see in his place, and their teams. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Rayleigh, who has moved to pastures new, while Mrs. Gauke takes on her new role as adviser to the Opposition Front Bench. The patience and skill of all those hon. Members in contributing to thorough, high-quality debate has been valuable indeed.</p>
<p>I want particularly to thank my hon. Friends the Financial Secretary, who until a few minutes ago was on his feet in the Chamber, and the Economic Secretary, for their support and assistance and their vigorous advocacy of the Government&rsquo;s case throughout our deliberations. I also thank the representative bodies that have worked with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs and with me at the Treasury during the Bill&rsquo;s passage for &nbsp;their help in identifying the need for Government amendments. There were numerous organisations, all of them helpful in our work.</p>
<p>In preparing these closing thoughts, Mr. Gale, I have, as you will imagine, been particularly vigilant on the question of starting any sentence with a &ldquo;but&rdquo;. But I thought that the Committee might be interested in the views of <span class="italic">Fowler&rsquo;s Modern English Usage</span>, second edition, 1965, on that point. It states that reluctance to begin a sentence with &ldquo;but&rdquo; is merely a superstition. No doubt that is a matter that we will debate for some time to come.</p>
<p>I thank all my hon. Friends on the Committee for their support and patience and their amenability to the supplications of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Cardiff, West. I am grateful for their support and help in ensuring a proper discussion of the Bill. I know that the whole Committee will join me in looking forward to the remaining stages.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-05-08_FIN_14-0_2007-06-07a.10.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" speakername="Theresa Villiers" time="14:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/finance/070607/pm/70607s06.htm" colnum="526">
<p> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. Finance Bills certainly are easier the second time around. I am delighted that this Committee&rsquo;s deliberations have not been quite as long or as stiflingly hot as last year&rsquo;s. As the Chief Secretary said, we have certainly had a chance to discuss a wide range of issues, and we have had some constructive discussions. We started out with some unfortunate gender confusion in relation to my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, but I am pleased to say that it was swiftly resolved. I was particularly pleased, because I did not fancy having to mug up on the details of excise duty on cigarettes and alcohol in the 30 seconds I had before he was due to address the Committee on those clauses.</p>
<p>The Opposition Treasury team is very sad, of course, to lose our shadow Paymaster General. The farewell of my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh was not as protracted as the Prime Minister&rsquo;s, but it had all the characteristic insight and good humour that we associate with him. We will miss him, but no doubt he will be a remarkably robust shadow Minister for Europe.</p>
<p>We heard a little less about Mrs. Gauke this year, but it is a pleasure to see her husband promoted to the Front Bench. I am delighted that his speaking debut this morning was greeted with a famous victory on the affirmative procedure, thanks to the good nature of the Financial Secretary. Little did he know when he dreamed of fame and fortune in political office that his first speech from the Front Bench would deal with missing trader intra-Community fraud and the sixth bank directive, but it was an excellent discussion.</p>
<p>Many other contributions stand out from our deliberations. My hon. Friends the Members for Windsor, for Ludlow and for Braintree made thoughtful contributions based on their business experience. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow demonstrated his extensive business expertise yet again with a few declarations of interest, and we heard about the private life of my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree and Mrs. Newmark, and their TV-watching habits. He gets this year&rsquo;s vocabulary prize for deploying the words &ldquo;interstices&rdquo; and &ldquo;tontine&rdquo;, and a special commendation for the only mention of &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; during the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Wirral, West braved the wrath of the contractor community by saying that IR35 really was not a big deal at all. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne generally held the fort alone for the Liberal Democrats, although the hon. Members for Twickenham and for Birmingham, Yardley have come off the subs&rsquo; bench now and again to make a contribution, which was of course welcome.</p>
<p>Turning to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, I think that we ought to add a new word to the dictionary: the verb &ldquo;to marris&rdquo;, which means to catch someone out, or to tear holes in their clause, their amendment or their grammar, and to generally beat the bat. The &ldquo;reverse marris manoeuvre&rdquo; is when the hon. Gentleman comes to one&rsquo;s rescue, as he did for the Economic Secretary on clause 27. We also had the odd situation in which my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham came to the rescue of the Economic Secretary when he was faced with questions from the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West to assure him that the insurance clauses under discussion were genuinely a simplification. I think that the best Wolverhampton, South-West moment came at the start of our discussion on clause 4 on inheritance tax. The hon. Gentleman called on his comrades to &ldquo;squeeze the rich&rdquo;. He is clearly in tune with the Labour party&rsquo;s return to its socialist routes this week.</p>
<p>The Committee should thank Government Front Benchers for coping without the Paymaster General, who has shouldered so much of the work on Finance Bills in the past. The Financial Secretary deserves special mention because he has covered so much of the Treasury&rsquo;s legislative work this year with the Statistics and Registration Service Bill, the Planning-gain Supplement (Preparations) Bill and the Income Tax Bill, which have numbered a mere 1,000 clauses or so. He has very much become the Treasury workhorse. We pass our sympathies on to the Economic Secretary for being landed with the clauses on pre-earned assets tax, which made post neo-classical endogenous growth theory look like an episode of the Teletubbies.</p>
<p>Finally, I thank you, Mr. Gale, and your co-Chairman Mr. Illsley for guiding us so wisely through our debates and for keeping us in line when we strayed out of order or too enthusiastically into a discussion of zero-carbon homes. I thank my colleagues on the Opposition Front and Back Benches for their incredibly hard work, which has taken place over many weeks.</p>
<p>I also thank those on the Government Benches as well for maintaining a generally constructive and friendly approach throughout the Committee; David Doig, who is an admirable successor to the legendary Frank Cranmer, whom we have all missed this year; the <span class="italic">Hansard </span>writers, the doormen and the Serjeant at Arms department for running our affairs efficiently; and of course to the Whips&mdash;the usual channels&mdash;for skilfully managing the Committee&rsquo;s time. With that I commend my thanks to members of the Committee for their contributions.</p>

<p> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale, I would obviously like to add my thanks to all the people who have been thanked on behalf of our group of four. We particularly have to thank those who have been schooling people in grammar&mdash;grammar schools are very important at the moment. Numeracy seems to have been less important than grammar to the Committee. I thank the external bodies that have ignored the Government&rsquo;s idea that they either talk to the Government or the Opposition, but not both. I would also like to thank the lead spokespersons from all parties for their excellent presentation.</p>

<p> Happily, none of those points of order are a matter for the Chair.</p>
<p>As we are strictly out of order, may I add the thanks of Mr. Illsley and myself to the Officers and staff of the House, without whom, as we all know, our work would be completely impossible. I also sincerely thank all members of the Committee on both sides for not only the expertise, but the good humour with which they have handled matters of great importance. It is a tremendous shame that there are no television cameras in the Room. Plenty of people outside the House see what happens on the Floor of the House and criticise us for bad behaviour. Unfortunately, very few people see the real work of the House, which happens in Committees such as this. For the manner in which members of the Committee have conducted themselves, I am extremely grateful.</p>
