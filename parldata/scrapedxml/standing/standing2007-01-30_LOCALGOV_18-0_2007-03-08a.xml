<p> When we adjourned earlier, I was waffling about a date. [Hon. Members: &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;] I have lots of help from my colleagues. I was making a point about occasions when the date of an election should be changed. It should be changed only in exceptional circumstances, to be helpful and supportive to the electorate. That would be the main reason.</p>
<p>The new clause will ensure that any such proposal would always come before the House. It would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and would be voted on by the House. I can confirm that we have spoken to the Local Government Association, which is content with the new clause.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire asked whether it would be a matter of arranging for the elections to be on the day of local council elections or on the day of European Parliament elections. The&nbsp;proposal in the new clause is to align the election dates. European Parliament elections always take place over a four-day period, from the Thursday to the Sunday, and they have to take place in June. The specific dates are set by the unanimous decision of member states in the European Council, so obviously the British Government would play a role in deciding on the date. Alignment of the dates is important.</p>
<p>There are two key points. The date will be set by agreement of the House of Commons&mdash;by a vote in the House&mdash;and the proposal is intended to help the electorate as a whole. Nobody would ever do this lightly. It is an important step. The new clause gives the option to the House to vote, if required, on the alignment of election dates.</p>

<p> I am grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s explanation, and thank her for the time that she spent on it. It is tempting for the people of Biggleswade to feel that perhaps those in Barcelona, Bavaria and Budapest should bend to their will. However, in the spirit of international co-operation, and on the basis that this may not happen on each and every occasion, we can appreciate the reasons for the new clause. I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the thinking behind it.</p>

<p> New clause 20 and Government amendment No. 245 relate to the desirable objective of bringing local authority services and health services closer together. It is proposed to establish a joint needs assessment to ensure that social care services and health services jointly engage in the assessment of local health needs. The argument behind the proposal is that we must do that without imposing extra or excessive bureaucracy in the system.</p>
<p>The types of needs assessment that already take place in some areas consider medium and long-term health needs. One area may have a particular difficulty with heart disease, lung disease or some such, and other areas may have different needs. The new clause allows for local discretion, but, in so far as it is not devolutionary, it compels health authorities and local authorities to do the needs assessment together. It will strengthen earlier clauses on local area agreements by requiring the responsible local authority and the primary care trust, being the two lead bodies, to produce such a needs assessment.</p>
<p>To put it on the record, a &ldquo;need&rdquo; means a significant overlap in the impact or potential impact of the exercise of functions of the primary care trust and the responsible local authority. Such an area might include social care provision for older people, which will be substantially affected by the delivery of both preventive and acute health care primarily by PCTs.</p>

<p> Would not that always occur?

<p> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. We are talking about the assessment of needs. It is a future assessment, and in that sense, it is not directly about the delivery of services. We are trying to address the fact that in some parts of the country, the PCT undertakes a needs assessment as part of its duties while a local authority addresses its social care priorities. The new clause is about joining up, simplifying, getting rid of bureaucracy and all the things behind the thrust of the Bill.</p>
<p>Hon. Members might recall mention during debate in Committee of there being too many targets. It is quite possible to have one target for a local authority and another, sometimes contradictory, target for health care. The deputy group leader of the Local Government Association&rsquo;s Conservative group, Councillor Milton from Westminster, often cites the case of Kent, which discovered apparently contradictory targets on teenage pregnancy for the local authority and PCT. That is not desirable. Members know of examples in their constituencies; indeed, we get applause during after-dinner speeches for pointing out contradictions in the bureaucracy. The new clause will address that problem. The hon. Member for Lichfield has a fair point, but the measure deals with needs assessment.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman mentioned districts. I believe that he represents an area covered by a district, one that we have heard about during this debate&mdash;Lichfield. We should not forget south-east Staffordshire and Staffordshire as well. The new clause will address that issue by requiring that in two-tier local authority areas, the county council must consult its district councils on the joint needs assessment.</p>
<p>Supporting statutory guidance on the clauses and part 5 of the Bill will make it clear that the local authority should take into account the joint strategic needs assessment&rsquo;s findings in setting targets in the local area agreement and in preparing the sustainable communities strategy, a point that I also direct to members of the Committee considering the Sustainable Communities Bill. I put it on the record because it will be useful to me in that Committee on Wednesday. The new clause should be seen as part of the broader provisions in part 5 to strengthen partnership. That in turn, we hope and intend, will help to deliver more responsive care.</p>
<p>Government amendment No. 245 will amend the Bill to ensure that new clause 20 comes into force by means of a commencement order rather than automatically two months after Royal Assent. That is a practical step to ensure that PCTs and local authorities have been provided with the necessary guidance to assist them in meeting the duty.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. It will. It puts the responsibility on the responsible local authority, which means the local authority responsible for social services. In that case, the local authority with more than one PCT would be covered. The responsibility is on the local authority as well as the PCT.</p>
<p>We are not so much banging heads together as saying, &ldquo;Make arrangements so that the needs assessment for your area is covered.&rdquo; The needs assessment itself would be for the local authority area and not necessarily the PCT area, which may be different in those instances where there is no coterminosity, which as the hon. Gentleman knows, are fewer now than they used to be due to the joined-up nature of this Government. I hope that, rather like the provision on joint waste authorities, that is seen as sensible.</p>
<p>We backed away&mdash;just to share this information with the Committee&mdash;from the requirement to put this assessment in the community strategy. That would be unpicking strategies that had already been decided. I expect that they will be part of that joint strategy. However, we do not want to make it a tick-box exercise, to use the management jargon; we want to make it real. On that basis, I commend the new clause to the Committee.</p>

<p> I have one brief point to make. I very much welcome the thrust of this new clause together with the other parts that strengthen consultation. I hope that this will enable us&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will be able to confirm it&mdash;to look not only at needs of the type that he referred to in his own comments but, for example, at the increasing need for capacity in GP surgeries and to make sure that there is clear involvement of the local authority.</p>
<p>If that happens, I hope that we can avoid the thoroughly unsatisfactory situation which arose, only this week, in my constituency. Due to a lack of capacity, a GP surgery suddenly got the PCT to issue a direction to change its catchment area. About 1,200 people, some of whom are quite elderly and have been with that surgery for 50 years, are arbitrarily told that they have to find another doctor. This is the excellent Bromley Common practice. The PCT arbitrarily took that decision because of a capacity issue. Neither the local council nor the local Members of Parliament knew anything about it until constituents and the local newspapers got on to them. This measure is welcome if, together with the other provisions that we have already discussed, it goes some way to preventing that thoroughly unsatisfactory situation.</p>
<p>It is important that the ethos of early consultation and involvement of elected representatives and patients is built into the system right the way through. I expressed concerns about the abolition of the patients forums and how effective LINKs would be in this regard. This is a classic example. This surgery&rsquo;s problem arose due to the Mayor of London, about two&nbsp;years ago, directing refusal of an application to build a surgery because the land was green belt. There has been a crying need for an alternative proposal for that practice, but there has not been a mechanism to pull everything together. In the end, we get this arbitrary decision without any form of consultation, which has caused great distress to a lot of my constituents. I hope that this provision will provide some means of dealing with such issues and would like reassurance on that point.</p>
<p>May I tell the Minister while he is thinking about it&mdash;to give him a little more time&mdash;that the Minister for London very much appreciated his Alan Curbishley joke?</p>

<p> I think that my Parliamentary Private Secretary appreciated it even less. That is probably why she is not here.</p>
<p>The reason for my puzzlement is that I do not honestly think that this clause addresses the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s point. I think that the rest of the Bill makes the situation that he describes less likely. This provision is not about the delivery of services. It is about the initial planning phase of a joint assessment of the health needs of the area. The GP capacity is directly and primarily a matter for the PCT. The hon. Gentleman will know that GPs stand in an unusual relationship with PCTs. The joint needs assessment could examine GP capacity as a need of course, but the PCT must take action to increase or decrease that capacity. That relates to our debate about the planning of services and the consultation on that issue. I hesitate to give the hon. Gentleman a guarantee, because the real world will get in the way of any such Government guarantee, particularly if a GP retires or other policies intervene.</p>

<p> I feel slightly guilty about putting the Minister on the spot, but this has been a timely opportunity to put that particular concern of my constituents on the record.

<p> I am more than happy to endorse the press release to the local paper in south-east London. The serious point is that the value of scrutiny has been demonstrated, and whatever policies one puts in place, they will never be perfect. That raises the paradox of devolution and equity. We have devolved power to a London level, but if London disagrees with the decision of a different level, one has problems. However, returning to the narrow confines of the Government new clause, in deference to my boss, the Whip, I shall sit down.</p>

<p> I had wondered whether this sleep-inducing process of saying &ldquo;aye&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; was going to continue, thereby allowing new clause 1 to slip in.</p>
<p>The new clause is about the single transferable vote. Clearly, some of my colleagues are dedicated followers of STV. In fact, some hon. Members in other parties may feel that my colleagues are obsessed by STV. I hasten to add that I do not put myself in that category. Yesterday we had an historic vote on the House of Lords. Today, there is an opportunity for another historic vote to reform our own voting systems and go for the single transferable vote for local council elections. Clearly, that particular solution is the Rolls-Royce of electoral systems to replace the Austin Allegro that we are currently attempting to drive. The Government might not want to go for the Rolls-Royce solution, but we have new clause 8 in front of us that would provide them with something in between&mdash;perhaps the Mondeo of electoral systems.</p>
<p>Let us focus on new clause 1 and the single transferable vote. It is important because proportionality ensures that each vote has the same worth. Hon. Members will know, depending on which part of the country they represent, how the present electoral parliamentary system helps them. Proportionality in south-west London, an area that I represent, is not effective, or at least people&rsquo;s votes are not reflected effectively in the political representation of Members of Parliament in that area. Fortunately in south-west London, the Liberal Democrats benefit from the lack of proportionality in relation to the Westminster system. The same applies at a local level as well.</p>
<p>We welcome the fact that Scotland is pioneering the use of STV for its local elections. In local elections from 2000 to the last election, voter turnout varied between 29.6 per cent. and a maximum of 40 per cent. Clearly, the turnout was very low. That is because in many parts of the country how people vote makes very little difference in terms of who is elected to represent them on their local council. Hence the need for the single transferable vote, which, we believe would improve voter turnout. Furthermore, it would make councils more representative of the communities that they seek to reflect and their elected representatives would be more representative of the communities that elect them.</p>
<p>In our view, more women would get elected under a single transferable vote system for local elections; currently, only 29 per cent. of local councillors are women. More members of the black and ethnic minority community would be elected as well; only 2 per cent. of local councillors are from that community.</p>
<p>I am realistic, however. I recognise that, although the Labour party in Scotland has conceded that STV is the way forward for local elections, there is no evidence so far that the Government in Westminster will endorse the system. If the Minister is not willing to support new clause 1, he has new clause 8 as an alternative. It is based on the Parliamentary and Local Elections (Choice of Electoral Systems) Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) and is about offering options to local councils. Why is that a way forward? We need a mixture of systems, and that principle has been accepted in London, where the electoral system chosen is different from any other in the country. Indeed, a beneficiary of that system is sitting in the Committee with us.</p>

<p> I thank the hon. Gentleman for pointing that out. However, the electoral system put together to elect members of the Greater London authority elected him, but equally elected other list members.</p>
<p>We accept the principle of different types of electoral systems. New clause 8 would provide options to local authorities in respect of the type of electoral system that they could adopt&mdash;whether, as set out in new clause 9, it was first-past-the-post, the single transferable vote, additional member, alternative vote or an alternative vote plus system. Local authorities would have a choice of systems, as they have a choice of whether to go for a mayoral or executive option.</p>

<p> If a small bunch of Liberal Democrats was able to arm-wrench the hon.

I shall pass on that message to my colleagues in Scotland, who will welcome it in the run-up to the Scottish elections. I am sure that they will make good use of that information.</p>
<p>New clause 9 sets out the different options that local authorities could go for. In new clause 8, we provide a method through which they would be allowed to opt for and try different systems, although they would not be allowed to change the electoral system on a regular and confusing basis; there would be a period during which they could not change the system.</p>
<p>The voting public cope very well with an electoral system in London that includes borough elections and elections for the Mayor, for the Greater London assembly, for Westminster and for the European Parliament, and may include at some point parish council elections. I am confident that that public would be able to cope with a system that changed from time to time, or with any of the options that local authorities could choose.</p>

<p> I believe that the hon.

<p> Thank you, Mr. Benton; I was going to make the point that the hon. Gentleman is tempting me to stray far beyond the remit of the new clauses.</p>
<p>As I stated at the beginning, new clause 1 offers what we consider to be the Rolls-Royce electoral solution&mdash;the one that would provide the most representative local government. However, if the Government are not keen on that, they have the alternative proposed by the hon. Member for Bury, North. That would provide the sort of choice that the Minister seeks to provide in other respects for local authorities.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman mentions choice, and my personal choice is the first-past-the-post system. However, new clause 9 lists various voting systems, ranging from first-past-the-post to the single transferable vote. Why can we not choose the system used for elections to the European Parliament? Do the Liberal Democrats favour some versions of proportional representation but not others?</p>

<p> It is rare at this stage of a Committee&rsquo;s proceedings to have so much excitement. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington for raising the issue. I hate to disappoint him yet again&mdash;he looks so tragic when I do.</p>
<p>Every voting system has its advantages and disadvantages, and hon. Members will have judged which they believe is best in the interests of democracy. I was somewhat surprised that the new clause was proposed, however, because after looking through my papers over the weekend, I came to the House on Monday only to read<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>headline that said, &ldquo;Campbell sets Brown tests for Lib-Lab coalition deal&rdquo;. I shall not go too far down this path, Mr. Benton, but given the question before us I think I might be given some licence. For many Liberal Democrat leaders the big issue&mdash;the deal-breaker&mdash;has been PR. Yet in an official briefing&mdash;&mdash;although it was later retracted&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;journalists were told proportional representation was &lsquo;not a deal breaker or a deal maker&rsquo;&rdquo;,</p>

<p> I have always been known as a very generous person and I do not want to intrude on private grief. I think you would instruct us to stick more closely to the amendment.</p>
<p>There are arguments for and against the introduction of a PR voting system and it has to be recognised that we have new PR systems for the devolved Administrations. The hon. Gentleman is tempting me because of that to welcome his new clause. Many of us are aware of the benefits of a first-past-the-post system, such as the direct relationship between the elected and the elector in a specific geographic area. That is something that many of us in this House greatly appreciate and value.</p>

<p> I have barely got into my stride. I will give way when I have talked about the merits of first past the post. It is that system that is used to elect councillors and local authorities in England and Wales. Members of the GLA are elected using the additional member system. I think that it does help members to represent the interests of their area when there is that clear relationship between the elected and the elector and when&mdash;this is very important&mdash;the citizen who elects people knows who they are electing and knows who is representing them. I acknowledge the virtues of some other voting systems but that is a significant advantage of the current system.</p>

<p> I understand what the Under-Secretary says in relation to the link between a constituency or a ward and the representative, but does she not agree &nbsp;with me that at a ward level, particularly if a ward is represented by three councillors under an STV system, it is still perfectly possible to achieve a link between a recognisable small area and representatives elected under STV?</p>

<p> Lots of things are possible in life but I still do not think the STV system or the systems described by the hon. Gentleman give that same accountability, which is also important.</p>
<p>Having said that, the Government recognise that first past the post is not the right system in every circumstance. We have a number of different systems. Mayors in local authorities are elected by the supplementary vote system. The Scottish Parliament has another system. The Welsh Assembly and Greater London assembly use the additional member system. The European Parliament uses the list system. In each of those cases there was a good reason why those systems were adopted&mdash;including the fact that it was in the Government&rsquo;s general election manifesto that those systems would be introduced. There was no such promise in our last election manifesto.</p>
<p>I do not think there are any grounds for changing the system for local government elections. That system wherein the elector goes into the polling booth and puts a cross by the name of their preferred candidate, and the candidate who gets the most votes wins, is very straightforward. The hon. Gentleman concentrates on the type of voting system, but a clear theme throughout our deliberations has been the need for strong leadership and strong governance. In democracy, it is not only the type of voting system that is important; the quality of leadership is also a test when we make that assessment.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman spoke about not wanting to cause too much confusion, but I found that strange when I re-read the new clause, given that if it were accepted councils could resolve to change their electoral system to one of the five types outlined in the new clause. We could end up with each district council a county area choosing a different electoral system with which to elect its members. That would be extraordinarily confusing for the electorate. I do not think you would get clear and accountable representation in those circumstances.</p>

<p> If the hon. Gentleman cannot understand why having five different electoral systems used to elect members to various bodies within one county is confusing, it probably explains why he is proposing the new clause and other hon. Members are opposing it.</p>
<p>Following its consultation on electoral reform in local government, the Local Government Association concluded that elections for the Scottish Parliament,&nbsp;the Welsh Assembly, the European Parliament and the Greater London assembly, which used alternative voting systems, have</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;involved greater complexity to the voter&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was also concerned that adding complexity might depress turnout or demoralise voters. The democracy task group commissioned by the LGA expressed concern</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;that the replacement of first past the post&rdquo;</p>
<p>with a system of proportional representation will</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;inevitably lead to an increase in the number of No Overall Control (NOC) authorities&rdquo;,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;has clear implications for stability of leadership&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The task group also stated that although there was no consensus</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;to either retain or replace the first-past-the-post system...a majority of the Task Group favour retaining and developing the existing system&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing review of the experiences of new voting systems used in the devolved Administrations. The Government feel that it would be inappropriate to try to pre-empt the findings of the review by encouraging the introduction of yet more electoral systems. In view of the those arguments, I hope that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is convinced that the proposed new clauses would not provide the best way forward and that he will withdraw them.</p>

<p>I was interested to hear the Under-Secretary deploy the fact that there might be an increase of authorities with no overall control as an argument against the new clauses as if such a situation would be the end of the world for local authorities. Others might say that such an increase would mean that different parties would have to work together to ensure that the majority views of a local authority were represented.</p>

<p> I believe that new clause 33 and new schedule 1 might command a greater degree of interest, if not support, from the Government than the previous group of new clauses. New clause 33 and new schedule 1 relate to the European charter of local self-government, in which the Minister indicated an interest during our sitting on 22 February. The purpose of the proposed measures is to ensure that the principle of local self government is recognised in legislation.</p>
<p>For those who are not so familiar with it, the charter states:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;All local authorities should manage a substantial proportion of public affairs in the interests of the local population&rdquo;,</p>
<p>which is something that I am sure all hon. Members support. The charter also states:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;The powers of local government must be recognised in legislation&rdquo;</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;local authorities must be able to act freely on all matters that they are best placed to deal with&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That is motherhood and apple pie in certain respects, but the charter contains a phrase that might be more problematic for the Government:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Financial resources must be made available to local authorities to local authorities to enable them to carry out their tasks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Government recognise the issues. On 22 February, the Minister indicated to my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove, who leads for the Liberal Democrats on such matters, that he was inclined to pursue the issue. In fact, he invited us to table written questions to enable him to come back with further detail on the matter. I assure the Minister that questions were tabled today. We have not given him much time, but they were tabled electronically so they will be in the system and he will be able to see them in a few days, and I am sure that he can respond to them in writing. The purpose of the written questions was to find out what discussions have taken place between the Government and local government&mdash;either individual local authorities or local government representative organisations&mdash;on the European charter of local self-government and the timetable for any future ratification of the charter.</p>
<p>The amendment, perhaps unlike those in the previous group, is positive. It would ensure that something the Government recognise as important is embedded in domestic legislation so that local government will have the safeguards that all members of the Committee want it to have to ensure that it can carry on its business in the way that we feel is appropriate and very much in the spirit of the Bill. With that, I conclude my remarks and hope to receive a more positive response from the Minister on new clause 33 and new schedule 1 than I did on the new clause relating to STV.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-01-30_LOCALGOV_18-0_2007-03-08a.26.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" time="14:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/localgov/070308/pm/70308s04.htm#07030883000168" colnum="619">
<p> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has tabled the questions electronically, a modernisation introduced when I was serving under my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), when he was Leader of the House.</p>
<p>The Government signed the European charter of local self-government on 3 June 1997 and ratified it on 24 April 1998. They did not choose to exercise the right to reservations to certain provisions allowed by the charter, so all its provisions have been relevant to local government since August 1998. In the explanatory memorandum that was laid before Parliament recommending that the United Kingdom ratify the charter the then Minister for Local Government and Housing, my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong), accepted that</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Subscribing to the charter strengthens the Government&rsquo;s partnership with local government and will enable key domestic policies to be developed and implemented more effectively&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For that reason, we were pleased to ratify the charter on the basis that it would enshrine</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;basic principles already reflected in the United Kingdom of local democracy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the time, we also made clear that any future legislation affecting local government should further strengthen the degree of compliance with aspects of the charter and ensure continued compatibility with its provisions. I am therefore happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that subsequent reforms to the system of local government in England and, indeed, those detailed in the Bill adhere to the provisions in the charter and the spirit in which it was developed.</p>
<p>For example, part 1 of article 10 of the charter sets out that local authorities shall be entitled to co-operate with other local authorities to carry out tasks of common interest, a prerogative granted by giving local authorities the power of well-being under section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000. Therefore, although we agree with the reasoning of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington in tabling the amendments, the Government see no reason to accept them on the basis that they would add nothing to the recognition that we have already given to the right to local self-government by ratifying the charter and adhering to its principles in subsequent reforms. That is the bad news.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we do not have in our parliamentary system a broad tradition of incorporating international treaty obligations wholesale into our domestic legislation&nbsp;when there is no need to do so. My notes do not say, &ldquo;Pause for intervention from Conservative Members regarding human rights law,&rdquo; although they ought to. However, in the absence of such an intervention, I shall answer the question that the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was going to ask. His predecessor would certainly have asked it.</p>
<p>Hon. Members may say that the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated the European convention on human rights, a Council of Europe treaty, into domestic law. However, the 1998 Act is distinct for one significant reason: it incorporated a human rights legal framework into domestic law, for the first time requiring domestic law to be interpreted as compatible with the convention. It provided a system of legal challenge and redress for UK citizens who were aggrieved about their rights, as set out in the convention. Its purpose was to bring those home those rights without the need, as was the case prior to the 1998 Act, for citizens to resort to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for any matter arising in relation to their rights under the convention. In other words, the Human Rights Act incorporated into domestic law that which was already domestic law, as covered by the treaty, and simply meant that one could access the law without having to go to Strasbourg. The European charter of local self-government provides no such mechanism of redress or challenge, so there is no case for incorporating its provisions wholesale into domestic law.</p>

<p> The Minister may be about to deal with this matter, but he has left me rather confused. Will he clarify why he suggested that my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove submit a written question? Was it so that the Minister could explain that the matter had already been ratified, everything is hunky-dory and we do not need to make any changes?</p>

<p> No, it was to say that the Government agree with the hon. Member for Hazel Grove and that the purposes, intent and outcome of the European charter&mdash;which is debated and is an important issue in local government, as the hon. Gentleman knows&mdash;are already in place and in operation and form one of the tests of new legislation.</p>
<p>I was going to say what the differences are in respect of the Human Rights Act, but the hon. Gentleman did not argue that there was a parallel, although others would. There is no case for incorporating the provisions of the European charter of local self-government wholesale into domestic law, because it provides no mechanism for redress or challenge, which is in stark contrast to the argument that I have just outlined in relation to the Human Rights Act.</p>
<p>Even if there were to be some monitoring or enforcement mechanism attached to the charter, which there is not, the relationship between the two instruments is different. One protects the rights of individual citizens and the other ensures that domestic institutional structures conform with internationally accepted norms. I strongly support the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s views, as anybody who has read my speech to the Committee of the Regions would understand. [Hon. Members:&ldquo;We all have.&rdquo;] I am glad to hear that.

<p> How much does the Minister think that those in local government can rely on the assurances contained in the European charter of local self-government, bearing in mind that local decisions made in the past couple of years by the people of France and the Netherlands on the rejection of the European constitution are presently being undermined by processes in the EU to get round the referendums that said no to the constitution?</p>

<p> The European charter is a treaty and member states are therefore obliged to comply with both it and the other treaties that have been mentioned. The proposed constitution is not a treaty. There is no redress mechanism in the European charter, so including the charter in UK law wholesale would duplicate pre-existing domestic law and would be unnecessary.</p>
<p>I strongly support the principles behind the charter, and I accept the argument of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington about the important part that the charter has played in delivering democratic local governance&mdash;and not just in the UK, incidentally. However, the new clause is unnecessary and it would introduce a confusing innovation into the expression of our existing legal framework for democratic local self-government. The Biggleswade villagers of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire would rise even more in anger at that. I ask the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington to consider those remarks.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister for his explanation and for his clarification that the charter has been ratified. Given that incorporation in UK legislation would be inappropriate in practical terms because of the lack of any redress mechanism or enforcement powers, the decent thing to do is not to press my arguments. Therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

<p> The schedule is given effect by clause 103, which repeals a number of outmoded or unnecessary provisions concerning matters which byelaws can currently address in the interests of tidying up and removing outdated provisions. For example, the schedule deals with section 231(1) of the Public Health Act 1936 so that references to byelaws regulating the location of bathing machines and the costumes to be worn by bathers are omitted.</p>

<p> No, I do not give way. My hon. Friend does not want to be drawn. There are none in Bedford&mdash;beaches, I mean.</p>
<p>The schedule also makes further minor amendments relating to health byelaws to remove obsolete provisions and makes minor refinements to provisions relating to enforcement by police community support officers, so that the enforcement of byelaws is consistent with the enforcement against similar low-level nuisances. The serious point is that to ensure that legislation is respected, we must have a means of abolishing outdated laws. Of course, the schedule will not remove the power to introduce byelaws consistent with the law.</p>

<p> I am assured that there is no such omission, but I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his vigilance. He might recall that during debate on the part of the Bill relating to parish byelaws, the Government argued successfully&mdash;he accepted it&mdash;that in order to be truly devolutionary, it was better to give an all-encompassing power rather than to name specific bodies.

<p> Before we come to the debate on the schedule, may I say on the Opposition&rsquo;s behalf how much we have appreciated being chaired by you, Mr. Benton, during these proceedings? We should be grateful if you also passed on that message to &nbsp;Mr. Chope. In thanking you, we also thank your hard-working staff and all Officers of the House. I know that in a moment, the Minister will thank his team and colleagues, both from his own Department and from the Department of Health. We have all benefited from their hard work in substantiating the clauses and those other issues that have been put before us. The conduct of the proceedings and the way in which both Ministers have dealt with the matters before us have been entirely conducive to an extremely favourable atmosphere in the Committee. We have worked hard, got things on the record and said what we wanted to say, and have done so in the very best of good humour.</p>
<p>Proceedings have been enlivened by the occasional champagne moment. May I beg your indulgence for two seconds, Mr. Benton, and consider the candidates eligible for giving us the champagne moment of the series? There are one or two on the Government Benches. The hon. Member for Bedford deserves one or two mentions for having pushed the odd amendment under the wire.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford has kept us in order, and his occasional prompt has been helpful to us all. The hon. Members for Hazel Grove and for Carshalton and Wallington have produced their own exceptional moments, not least this afternoon when yet again they put forward STV&mdash;more in hope than expectation&mdash;and gave it a good run.</p>
<p>On my own Benches, my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, who is sadly not with us this afternoon, ensured that Shropshire was mentioned as much as Bedfordshire. He spoke warmly of the powers that might have been lost in his area with the powers of direction that we discussed during the early part of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst did a great deal to ensure that Bromley and Chislehurst was kept well on the map. His extensive knowledge of local government matters in London and of Pratts Bottom provided great moments for the Committee.</p>
<p>Running up very much on the rails is my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate. In moving very creditably the first amendment that I suspect he has moved to a Committee, he introduced us to the formidable Mrs. Burrowes. I hope that she will appreciate that by her endeavours, we have now gone beyond the formidable. We now know that we can also refer to her as redoubtable, rigorous, exacting, tremendous, colossal, indomitable and&mdash;my personal favourite&mdash;puissant.</p>

<p> This lady, against whom none of us should play Scrabble for cash, has risen still further in the estimation of this Committee with news of the pending sixth member of the Burrowes household. May I ask my hon. Friend what his majority is as he is doing a valid job in trying to increase it?</p>
<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Poole has the honour and distinction of being the very first member of any Standing Committee to ask a witness their business and to start off the proceedings of the witness process in Standing Committees in the House. He will always be remembered for asking the first question in such a session. It was a moment of history and certainly a champagne moment.</p>

<p> The hon. Member for Poole will also be remembered for the wonderful speech in which he moved an amendment and then disclosed that he had forgotten why he was moving it.</p>

<p> I discount that because so many Ministers do that. It is less of a champagne moment than a recurring occasion.</p>
<p>Just before I close my remarks on the Ministers, I have to say we remember the Under-Secretary carrying through with grace a number of different clauses, particularly those relating to parishes. The Minister for Local Government has carried the bulk of the Bill. His personal good humour and qualities make it damned difficult to pin anything on him. He is exceptionally reasonable and knowledgeable in these areas, and has certainly given the Committee the benefit of his great wisdom and we have enjoyed working with him and occasionally fighting against him.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the first champagne moment was the best: the explosion on to this Committee of the blond bombshell, who was moved to put Lichfield on the map because he was so tired of hearing about Shropshire and Bedfordshire. My hon. Friend told us in great detail about the solid gold baubles held in Lichfield, in contrast with our Mace downstairs, which is only silver gilt. As you know, Mr. Benton, it is not only what you say, but how you say it. The moment that my hon. Friend brought Lichfield into this Committee will be long remembered. He therefore has my vote for the champagne moment of the proceedings.</p>

<p> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that moment was somewhat reduced in intensity when we learned that the hon. Member for Lichfield does not represent the biggest parish council in England?</p>

<p> Those are minor details. We should not forget the majesty of the moment.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your indulgence, Mr. Benton. I thank all those who have helped move the Committee proceedings forward. We look forward to dealing with the Bill on Report in due course.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-01-30_LOCALGOV_18-0_2007-03-08a.44.17" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" time="15:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/localgov/070308/pm/70308s06.htm#07030883000258" colnum="630">
<p> I echo many of the comments made by the official Opposition spokesman in thanking you, Mr. Benton, and Mr. Chope, for chairing the Committee so effectively. I thank your officials for providing the appropriate support and help at the time when it was needed. I thank the Ministers for their repartee, which I have enjoyed considerably during our debates, as have my hon. Friends.</p>
<p>There have been so many champagne moments that I suspect that the term &ldquo;champagne socialist&rdquo; is about to make a reappearance. The Opposition have lost a number of major battles, but we have won a few skirmishes along the way and we will return to a number of the&nbsp;issues on Report and, no doubt, in another place when the time comes, where, after last night&rsquo;s proceedings in the House, this Bill will be received in a very rowdy fashion. However, I am sure that those in another place will enjoy it. I have enjoyed the proceedings and look forward to many more in this place.</p>

<p> If I may, I should like to say from the Back Benches how much I have enjoyed being a member of the Committee and what a positive experience it has been. I thank you, Mr. Benton, and your colleague, Mr. Chope, for helping to maintain the positive atmosphere from which we have all benefited.</p>
<p>It is not unknown for Government Whips, whatever the Government, to pack Committees with hon. Members whose key qualification is that they have no knowledge of, or any interest in, the matters at hand. However, that has not happened on this occasion. Colleagues in this Committee have a deep interest in local government and public involvement issues and they have experience, to boot, which has benefited the scrutiny and debate that we have enjoyed. Perhaps Government Whips can take this message to heart and pass it on: this is the way things should be done in future.</p>
<p>We have learned about towns throughout the land, some of which I had never heard of before, including some fine names from Manchester way, which I should like to hear again.</p>

<p> I thank my hon. Friend. We also heard about Biggles, the famous constituent of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, who I had not come across for some decades&mdash;in fact, since I was a boy&mdash;in respect of the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s views on European elections. I wondered where he had flown to. Clearly, he landed in Biggleswade&mdash;and there he will stay. Most welcome of all have been the numerous opportunities to make relevant and highly deserved references to Bedford, Kempston and Bedfordshire.</p>
<p>We have also learned that, as a result of the hard work and commitment of a number of Committee members, they are ready to forego their lunch or dinner, depending on what part of the country they come from.</p>
<p>Above all, we have benefited from the constructive, co-operative approach of all Opposition Members. The tone was undoubtedly set by my hon. Friends the Ministers, who have, by their listening approach, generated that response, which is welcomed by all hon. Members. Not only have my hon. Friends rejected a centralising authoritarian tone, they have been devolutionary and open in their approach. That has had the unexpected benefit of generating what my neighbour, the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, famously coined a champagne moment followed by many more. I have not kept count, but no doubt we shall see the benefits one day. A sad fact about the conclusion of our proceedings is that there will be no more. I thank all members of the Committee for what they have done to make this a worthwhile experience.</p>

<p> I am grateful to you, Mr. Benton, for your chairing of the Committee along with Mr. Chope, and for allowing me a couple of minutes to reflect on &nbsp;the context in which the Bill now proceeds. As others have said, it has been a Committee stage of great humour and constructive debate and one in which people have boasted about the achievements of local authorities. I have not had to say anything much about Derbyshire&rsquo;s achievements. Everyone knows that it was the first county council to receive a four-star rating and that it has maintained the position at the top of the tree, which speaks for itself.</p>
<p>In my capacity as chair of the all-party group on the community and voluntary sector, I wish to say a word about the importance of the Bill. For the record, I also chair the board of trustees of the Community Development Foundation and I am a member of the Commission on the Future of Volunteering, as is the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire. During the past 12 months, the third sector has come of age under legislation. Before then, we did not have a Minister for the third sector or an office of the third sector in the Cabinet Office, which works closely with Ministers at the Department for Communities and Local Government. We did not even have a Department with &ldquo;communities&rdquo; in its title and that was dedicated to prioritising the values that communities embody.</p>
<p>Twelve months ago, we did not have the Charities Act 2006. I had the honour of serving on the Standing Committee that discussed it. The Act brought about the most radical uprating of charities legislation for 400 years. It brought in root-and-branch changes to how charities in the voluntary sector operate. This week, the Charity Commission launched its consultation on the meaning of public benefit. In the past few weeks, the Offender Management Bill has produced a great debate about the role of the voluntary sector in delivering such services. I very much hope that, following last night&rsquo;s vote, my suggestion of indirect elections to another place might be taken up and that the voluntary sector will be well represented there, too.</p>
<p>This Bill has been dynamic and almost revolutionary in its approach to how the voluntary sector, the third sector, the community sector and social enterprise feature within the framework of our society. It has recognised the sector like no other measure before it. It has involved local area agreements and local strategic partnerships. It has made the delivery of services something in which the sector will be a real partner. The development of community strategies will be a major part of the Bill and we cannot exclude community groups and voluntary sector groups from that. The Bill has given them a statutory role in consultation. It has even integrated them into the scrutiny of health.</p>
<p>Although the Bill has not been hitting the headlines, it will achieve many of the aims of the Sustainable Communities Bill that is before the House. We shall look back on it as a landmark for having liberated that sector and as a milestone in the development of participative democracy. I accept that it still has a long way to go, but the voluntary and community sector has many friends in another place and I am sure that its role will only be enhanced by the treatment there. I wish the Bill fair wind in another place. I look forward to it coming back to the Floor of the House and, one day, we shall look back on it not only as representing&nbsp;an entertaining and historic few weeks because of how the Committee operated, but as a landmark in the history of the voluntary sector.</p>

<p> I echo the comments that have been made. I want to use this opportunity to remind the Committee about the proposals on unitary consideration and re-emphasise that I have written to all members of the Committee and you, Mr. Benton, fulfilling my pledge to give details of the amendment that we intend to introduce on Report. There was some concern and I accepted that. We have concluded our discussions with the Local Government Association and that is reflected in the amendment. I said that I would write to the Committee and I did so this morning.</p>
<p>I would like to make a few observations. First, I echo the regret that the press do not report the proceedings of Standing Committees as much as they should. Due to the changes that have been introduced, I know that there is access to our deliberations through the internet. I believe that Standing Committees are webcast&mdash;I am not sure what that means, but it says it here. However, I really do think that commentators and parliamentary reporters should report more because these matters are of importance to many tens of thousands of councillors around the country.</p>
<p>I know that the Minister for Local Government, whoever he or she is, and his or her colleagues, receive much correspondence on these matters in their postbags. I have been following the<span class="italic">Local Government Chronicle</span>and the<span class="italic">Municipal Journal</span>&mdash;I do not wish only to pick out the LGC&mdash;and they have not been following our proceedings as closely as I would wish.</p>

<p> Is it not a comment on the nature of much of our media that I am sure that the Committee would have been reported on if we had had lots of personal nasty rows? Instead, we have got on with the job that Parliament expects and are completely ignored.</p>

<p> That is the dilemma of politics. I was reflecting on the fact that had the short title of the Bill been &lsquo;Abolition of Swimming Gear: Brighton Beach&rsquo;, it probably would have got more coverage, if you will pardon the pun. I have been working on that; perhaps I should not have bothered.</p>

<p> The Committee would do well to consider the evidence session of the Public Administration Select Committee today which was looking at that very point, with evidence taken from mySociety. The problem is not so much the media, but ourselves. We are in the dark ages in terms of electronically communicating the affairs of the House and, in particular, Standing Committees, in a consistent manner. That is why there is a problem of communication.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-01-30_LOCALGOV_18-0_2007-03-08a.44.26" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" time="15:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/localgov/070308/pm/70308s06.htm#07030883000278" colnum="634">
<p> Clearly the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s five children have been informing him of the state of modern technology. I too have that benefit from youngsters. The problem involves a bit of both, I &nbsp;believe. I make that point because the law is based on the intent of Parliament. That is expressed by Members in making legislation as well as by Government in putting forward proposals. That is important.</p>
<p>My most sober moment during the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations was when the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire returned from his visit and reminded us that although we may have differences over issues of public policy, they pale into insignificance compared to the difficulties of some countries.</p>
<p>As someone who has been the Whip on three local government Bills as well as having helped to shape this Bill, my second reflection is that I strongly believe that there is a significant step-by-step improvement going on within local government. The independent auditors say so, although the public do not always say so and that is their right. Their expectations increase and we have to just accept that. That is the nature of democratic politics.</p>
<p>Local government is, however, improving. One of the reasons for that is a broad consensus across the Local Government Association. I pay tribute to Sir Jeremy Beecham, David Kemp, Sir Simon Milton and Lord Bruce-Lockhart who have put into place that consensus. They have built up a consensus that is not wishy-washy or based on the lowest common denominator. We work with them across Whitehall and across local councils, and we tried to shape the White Paper and the Bill in the context of that consensus. I believe that that has been reflected in our deliberations.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire was kind enough to make some flattering remarks about my good self. I wish that he would stop, because his remarks do not always help me when I am in the White Hart in Lydgate, but I am grateful to him none the less. I have always shared the attitude of others from Greater Manchester that more flies are caught with honey than with vinegar. That is worth remembering in life as well as in politics.</p>
<p>In my view, the Bill is mistitled. It is not a Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill; it is a local government reform Bill, a local government involvement in health Bill and a public involvement in local government and health Bill. It tries to bring together public services in a new local framework, and I think that that is very important.</p>
<p>Similar aspirations are embodied in the Sustainable Communities Bill, which is promoted by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) and which is being debated in another Committee. That Bill should now be considered in light of the policy positions and discussions that have been considered in this Committee, and I look forward to further debates on it.</p>
<p>I echo the thanks that have been expressed to you, Mr. Benton. As ever, it has been a pleasure to work under your chairmanship. Four or five years ago, I was appointed as the Whip for the hon. Gentleman who is our Chairman, and I read advice from the various available publications on how to conduct the affairs of a Whip. That included measures that one could take to persuade and cajole&mdash;one is not allowed to say &ldquo;bribe&rdquo;, but you know what I mean. I looked down a list of my&nbsp;flock, at the head of which was your name, Sir, and I thought, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am in a position, as a new Member, to tell Mr. Benton what he should and shouldn&rsquo;t be doing.&rdquo; So I informed him what the Whip was and when, and asked him if he would kindly consider travelling to Westminster to take part in Divisions, and normally, Sir, you did&mdash;and I was very grateful.</p>
<p>The second name on the list was that of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), and the third was that of the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman). At that point I put in a transfer request.</p>
<p>You bring huge experience to the Chair, Mr. Benton, and a gentlemanly approach to our affairs, and your constituents are well served by you, as are those of Mr. Chope. I first met Mr. Chope in 1986, when he was the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Brooke, who was then the Minister with responsibility for universities. It was he who wisely informed me about the theory of cock-up and conspiracy&mdash;advice which I have carried with me ever since. Mr. Chope was the Under-Secretary with responsibility for local government for two years in the 1980s, and has a huge amount of experience in local government. I know that he was pleased to be asked to chair the Committee, and I pass my thanks to him through you, Mr. Benton.</p>
<p>I also thank the Clerks, who as ever are professional and patient, and the<span class="italic">Hansard</span>writers, who have had to put up with a variety of accents from across England&mdash;not least my own&mdash;which make life difficult. I hope hon. Members noticed that I did not pronounce &ldquo;bathing costumes&rdquo; in the way in which it would be pronounced in my part of the world. I am grateful also to the Doorkeepers. We have had a small number of Divisions, which reflects the care with which the Bill was drafted, but the Divisions that took place reflected some important points of honest difference between the parties.</p>
<p>I thank especially the officials&mdash;not only those from my Department, who have worked diligently on the Bill and on the White Paper for several years and who have put a huge amount of effort into them. I have seen proof of the old adage that preparation and planning make life easier. The Committee might wish to know that some of the officials worked for Mr. Chope when he was Under-Secretary of State. I can testify from my experience that the professional reputation of civil servants and officials is well founded.</p>
<p>We have also been helped by officials from the Department of Health, whose money I am using to pay for the champagne at the reception that we will be having at a suitable point, and officials from the Cabinet Office. We have also been served by officials from the Electoral Commission who have given their advice.</p>

<p> To pick up on the plaudits to officials, we Back-Benchers ought also to thank the many organisations that have contributed to the debate and supported us throughout the process. For me personally, it was the Local Government Information Unit and the Local Government Association, but other colleagues have received support from a range of bodies. I just wanted to put that on record.</p>

<p> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. My experience is that the amount of briefing, concern and lobbying on local government far outweighs that in other areas of public policy, for obvious reasons. What has struck me is the level of professionalism in the bodies making representations. As my hon. Friend says, they are to be thanked.</p>
<p>I also thank Committee members. This Committee stage has been an enlightening experience. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedford rightly said that care had been taken to ensure that the Committee included Members of Parliament who know what they are talking about. When my hon. Friend the Whip suggested that approach, I was somewhat taken aback. I am one of only a few members of this Committee who have never been a councillor. I have tallied up the years of experience in local council represented on the Committee, and it is substantial. It makes Brian Lara&rsquo;s scores look rather low. That expertise is across the range, for which I am grateful to hon. Members.</p>
<p>It has also been enlightening. We heard about the family of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate. We congratulate him and look forward to the new arrival. He is a lawyer, which I do not hold against him. One of the few things to which I am looking forward in the event that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister stands down is once again being able to take the mickey out of lawyers and public schoolboys. During the past 13 years, we have not been allowed to do so&mdash;says he, trying to remember whether the Chancellor has ever been a lawyer. No, he has not, so we are on safe ground. The point that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate made about reported crime has had a big impact on thinking in the Department, and I thank him for it. It shows that raising such points is worth while.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Lichfield came to the aid of the mace of Lichfield. What he did not know was that I had received advice the previous day from no less a figure than the head of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers. If colleagues want to join a trade union, SOLACE is not a bad one to remember. I point out that the average tenure of the chief executive of a local authority has been less than that of a Minister for Local Government for 15 years. I am not sure whether that is a good thing or a bad thing; I suspect that it is a bad thing.</p>
<p>The head of SOLACE asked me whether I had looked at the issue of maces, because when proposing to create unitary councils, one must protect the traditions and nuances of local councils, including parishes. He informed me that one of the biggest difficulties in the Banham proposals considered in the 1990s was that the Government of the day realised that unless they introduced late amendments to the Bill, they would be in danger of confiscating all the maces from the councils. I took his advice. When the hon. Member for Lichfield raised the issue of the mace, which he did in his usual friendly and jocular fashion, he was making a serious point. In making changes, one must bring people along and protect traditions where they do good, not harm. There is an important philosophy running through this radical Bill, which the exchange on maces led to.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Poole has an Adjournment debate with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government at the end of proceedings tonight on the local government finance settlement in Poole. The hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s proposition, as a true Conservative, is that because it is rich it should get more money. That has been the argument of the right for many centuries. The argument to the contrary that we Labour Members tend to put, is often put with more passion, but rarely with as much articulateness and diligence&mdash;</p>

<p> Articulation. I thank my hon. Friend. I should be grateful if she gave me a glass of water. The hon. Gentleman will be making his case on behalf of his constituency. It is a pleasure to work with him in Committee. He always gets to the big point and does not mess around with the trivial points, and the debates reflect that.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Hazel Grove cannot attend. He has apologised for missing this afternoon&rsquo;s sitting. He and his colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench have, on the whole, put their points fairly and have, I think, accepted the genuine intentions of the Bill, which is on the whole devolutionary. They have taken the opportunity, as Liberal Democrats often do, to read some press releases, which are normally about the single transferable vote. I refer to that in my notes as the single transferable speech, because I have heard it many times and it is always the same. Nevertheless, I suppose that they should be congratulated on their consistency. I thank them for the way in which they have approached the Committee.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is part of the 555 group. There are three members of that group on this Committee who were elected in 2005.</p>

<p> I said in response to the hon. Gentleman&rsquo;s maiden speech that he was a category A Member of Parliament. He has shown his diligence in this Committee, as well as his expert knowledge of local government. I thank him for that.</p>
<p>I particularly thank my Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford, who, with his Opposition colleagues, has ensured that there has been sensible time for debate. The noble Lords will, on reading the proceedings in<span class="italic">Hansard</span>, be satisfied that scrutiny has been given in the right way and with due time, without the need for confrontation. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the way in which he and his colleagues have crafted that and I thank all the hon. Members involved.</p>
<p>I also thank my hon. Friends, who have brought to the Committee knowledge, not just of local government, but their many years of experience in their constituencies and of the voluntary sector. I thank them for that. I will be scrutinising proposals in Bedford with particular vigilance, given the views that have been expressed. I look forward to that.</p>

<p> Before the Minister ends his thanks, I want to point out that the unique thing about this &nbsp;Committee is that we were able to question people prior to our proceedings. It is right to put on the record our thanks to the officials who facilitated that unique process, which was useful. That is a good innovation that will benefit the scrutiny process in the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-01-30_LOCALGOV_18-0_2007-03-08a.44.34" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" time="15:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/localgov/070308/pm/70308s06.htm#07030883000307" colnum="638">
<p> In echoing that, all Committee members will have noticed that, when changes are introduced in parliamentary proceedings, there are those who wish to see rapid, radical change and those who resist it. However, life has a way of bedding in and my belief is that, in future, it will be taken as read that it is common sense to undertake such evidence sessions. In reality, the procedure saved Committee members time, because we would have been lobbied in any event. I remember that we were lobbied in our advice surgeries and around our constituencies about the minimum wage legislation, so I echo those remarks.</p>
<p>I particularly thank my Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham who, like the Whip, is silenced by the process that we undertake in Committee deliberations. Not only has she been of enormous help to me and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, but she helped to influence the policy, the debate and the amendments. We would not have had so many champagne moments without her. I have always been proud to be a champagne socialist. I have never seen the point of socialism unless it involves the proposition, &ldquo;If they can have it, why can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; I think that the term was originally intended as an insult to members of the Labour party, but I never saw it as such myself. However, in light of my confession, I should like to spend some more of the Department of Health&rsquo;s money on champagne for Committee members at a suitable point. The French vintner Joseph D&rsquo;Argent said,</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;No Government could survive without champagne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How right he was.</p>
<p>The Bill is very important in relation to the reconfiguration of public finances and the relationship not only between central and local government but between central Government and government services provided locally. Although the framework that we are adopting in the Bill has not, as my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak said, been the subject of headlines, the Bill will have good repercussions far beyond this Committee in the years to come. I know that it has been welcomed by the Local Government Association and others.</p>
<p>I thank you, Mr. Benton, and the rest of the Committee, and I look forward to working with members of the Committee in implementing the legislation in future.</p>

<p> Before I put the remainder of the proceedings to the Committee, let me respond on behalf of Mr. Chope and myself by saying what a great pleasure it has been to have the privilege of chairing this Committee. I thank the Ministers, Opposition spokespeople and all members of the Committee for the courtesy and co-operation that they have extended to Mr. Chope and myself throughout our proceedings.</p>
<p>I value, as always, the assistance provided by the learned Clerks, the Official Reporters and everybody who has contributed to the smooth running of this Committee. Just one quick comment of my own on the uniqueness of the Committee, I think that our experience with the witness contributions at the&nbsp;beginning of the proceedings proved very valuable. It was most interesting. I do not know where things will go to from here, but I found it very valuable and informative. Thank you all very much indeed.</p>
