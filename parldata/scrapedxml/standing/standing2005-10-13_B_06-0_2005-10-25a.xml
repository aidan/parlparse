<p> Amendment No. 2 would restrict the provisions of current airgun legislation to England and Wales and open the way for alternatives to be introduced in the Scottish Parliament. Amendment No. 3 would create a licensing scheme in the Scottish Parliament, similar to that proposed by the Government last week, insofar as it would license the vendors rather than the purchasers. The intention is that the licensing scheme introduced in the Scottish Parliament would allow more checking of purchasers by making it one of the conditions necessary for obtaining a vendor&#039;s licence. It would therefore affect the check on those owning air weapons, as we heard last week. &nbsp;</p>
<p>New clause 1 is effectively a reverse Sewel motion. For the constitutionally minded, authority would remain at Westminster, but responsibility for this provision would transfer to the Scottish Parliament at this time. New clause 2 would devolve responsibility for air weapons for all time. </p>
<p>The amendments and new clauses are not constitutional meanderings. They would implement the correct air weapon licensing scheme in Scotland. England has a profound problem with firearm crime, and the Government are right to address it. We heard from the hon. Members for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) and for Brent, South (Ms Butler) last week that handgun culture is growing in their constituencies and in many other parts of England. I shall come to that in due course. </p>
<p>Let us consider the differences in gun crime between Scotland and England. The last year for which we have information is 2003&ndash;04. In England, there were 68 firearm murders, 1,195 attempted murders and more than 10,000 firearm offences. If my memory serves me correctly, the police say that about 8,900 of those offences involved real firearms. In Scotland, there was one murder, four attempted murders and fewer than 200 firearm crimes, and real firearms were identified in 194 cases. </p>

<p> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be extremely accurate with the figures; he should remember that some 55 million people live in England, and only 5 million in Scotland. That is proportionate with the figures that he has given.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" speakername="Stewart Hosie" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s01.htm" colnum="208">
<p> The hon. Gentleman makes the valid point that proportionality should be taken into account, but England had 1,195 attempted murders and Scotland nowhere near 10 per cent. of that number over the same period, and England had 68 firearm murders but Scotland only one. Proportionality does not enter either equation. England has a specific difficulty with real firearm crime, and the Government are right to address it. Scotland&#039;s problem is primarily air weapon crime, and I shall explain why in a few moments.</p>
<p>I shall put the figures into context. There have been fewer firearm murders in Scotland in 10 years than there were in England in a single year. The statistics for crimes involving handguns, mentioned last week, are even more startling. England had 5,123 handgun crimes, including 35 murders, compared with 29 handgun crimes and no murders in Scotland over the same period. However, although Scotland had fewer than 200 crimes associated with identified firearms, it had 415 air weapon crimes&mdash;200 per cent. more. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1413" speakername="Stephen McCabe" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s01.htm" colnum="208">
<p> I want to put a simple point to the hon. Gentleman. I understand clearly the case that he makes, but how concerned would he be if we were to restrict the legislation so that it applied only to England and Wales, and Scotland suffered a displacement effect as criminals moved north to enjoy protection that they would not have in England and Wales?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" speakername="Stewart Hosie" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s01.htm" colnum="209">
<p> There would be no displacement effect thanks to weaker legislation; we are proposing &nbsp; tougher legislation. I suspect that if there were displacement, and I doubt there will be, it would go the other way. Such crimes tend to be geographically specific; one would not travel from Dundee to Coventry to fire an air weapon. One would fire it where one had it.</p>
<p>The proposals would effectively devolve airgun legislation to the Scottish Parliament so that an effective licensing scheme can be introduced. When the initial legislation was published, we felt that the provisions for air weapons did not go far enough. The Government amendments last week made some progress but cover only vendors, not purchasers. If any of the options that we have proposed were accepted by the Government and the Committee, they would allow the Scottish Parliament to put in place a licensing scheme directed more at the purchaser than the vendor. We believe that that is vitally important. </p>
<p>Secondly, the devolution of the airgun legislation would offer an appropriate licensing scheme. Again, some concession was made last week but there was concern that the Bill was a catch-all piece of legislation and that sports clubs, target shooters, airsoft members, and those who used their weapons for vermin control and so on might be caught. We are convinced that if an appropriate licensing scheme were put in place in Scotland to take the Scottish circumstances into consideration, it would be a sensitive licensing scheme that would allow those entitled to hold, buy or hire air weapons or ammunition to do so, and restrict only those who were not entitled to have them. </p>
<p>Two issues were raised last week that are related to this matter. In the final sitting, the Minister suggested in answer to a question that I put that, and I paraphrase, she sought a balance between utility and cost within the practicality of introducing a licensing scheme and the bureaucracy and cost associated with it. One of the Tory Members&mdash;I believe that it was the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)&mdash;mentioned the number of air weapons in circulation. I think that the figure given was 7 million, with perhaps 650,000 in Scotland. </p>
<p>My recollection of being a child is that a large number of air weapons, air rifles and pistols were in people&#039;s garages and garden sheds with bent barrels, dismantled bits and rusted barrels, and they were utterly unserviceable. I suspect that the number of serviceable weapons is rather less than the 7 million suggested and that the large majority of those are in the hands of responsible people who would volunteer anyway to enter into a licensing system or scheme. The licensing scheme would also open up the opportunity for a voluntary disposal system for old and non-functional weapons that people no longer require or wish to have in their possession. For all those reasons, we believe that the introduction of a licensing scheme in Scotland is appropriate. </p>
<p>The hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan) raised a point a while ago about the difference between Scotland and England. I have spoken to a number of serving police officers, including some senior ones, and they tell me that their concern over real gun crime is negligible in some &nbsp; force areas. They are concerned about imitations, knives and air weapons. We believe in the devolution of airgun legislation to Scotland to introduce an appropriate licensing system for Scotland and to toughen up the legislation so that it is not merely the vendor who is licensed. A licence on the purchaser, holder or owner would be the most appropriate course of action, and I hope that the Committee will accept those recommendations. </p>

<p> I ask colleagues on both sides to reject the amendments in the name of the Scottish Nationalist party on the basis that they are as totally irrelevant to the Committee as they are to the people of Scotland, who merely want safe, effective legislation, which is what the Government propose.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" speakername="Jonathan Djanogly" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s02.htm" colnum="210">
<p> We are not in favour of devolving these powers to Scotland. Nor are we in favour of a licensing scheme, which we believe would be impractical.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) spoke about a wide range of issues, many of which I shall address in the clause stand part debate, so, if he does not mind, he will have to wait until then. I want to put on the record the fact that we will not support the amendment. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" speakername="John Thurso" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s02.htm" colnum="210">
<p> I have often said in Committee and when discussing statutory instruments that what can be devolved should be devolved. In this instance, however, close examination suggests that the negative consequences of having a system in Scotland that is separate from that of the rest of the United Kingdom would not be helpful, so although I sympathise with the amendment&#039;s intention, we will resist it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" speakername="Hazel Blears" speakeroffice="The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety"  time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s02.htm" colnum="210">
<p> Despite his imaginative use of a reverse-Sewel provision, I am afraid that the hon. Member for Dundee, East has found that the vast majority of Committee members are against him. I, too, urge the Committee to resist his amendments. Firearms are a reserved matter for a very good reason; we recognise the ease of movement across the border between England and Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe) made that very point. As he said, guns can easily be transferred between the countries, resulting in loopholes that can be exploited by people who want to misuse weapons. It is therefore right that we have a unified system.</p>
<p>Since the dreadful incident involving the young child Andrew Morton, I have been working extremely closely with Scottish Ministers to ensure that we toughen up the law not only in Scotland, but throughout Great Britain. Air weapon misuse is a problem for us. The vast majority of people use their guns responsibly, but air weapon misuse has been increasing, so it was important to table the new amendments that we discussed last week to provide that weapons can be sold only through a registered firearms dealer. That will mean that only responsible retailers will be able to sell air weapons, and it will stop &nbsp; the casual, anonymous purchases that lead to the vast majority of problems caused by air weapons. </p>
<p>Air weapons will need to be sold face to face rather than through mail order or the internet. The provisions will mean that we have the balance about right. Much of the Bill is about achieving a balance. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s suggestions would lead to huge bureaucracy and would not necessarily be effective in enforcing the responsible use of weapons, which we all want, or in bearing down on the mischief of irresponsible use. I ask him to withdraw his amendment. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" speakername="Stewart Hosie" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s02.htm" colnum="211">
<p> The Minister suggested that guns could be transported between Scotland and England if the legislation was not uniform. Of course, that is true. I suggest most respectfully, however, that railways are also devolved, and that trains move between countries. It is not a particularly strong argument.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" speakername="John Thurso" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s02.htm" colnum="211">
<p> May I correct the hon. Gentleman, as I have had the Liberal Democrat party&#039;s transport brief? The railways are devolved only in as much as they are entirely within Scotland.</p>
</speech>

<p> The hon. Gentleman&#039;s point is well made.</p>
<p>The Minister suggested that non-uniform legislation might lead to a loophole and to guns being moved across borders, but we are suggesting tougher, not weaker, legislation in Scotland. I hope that all hon. Members recognise that. In light of what various hon. and right hon. Members have said, however, it would be foolish to press my amendment to a vote, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. </p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. </p>
<p>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. </p>

<p> I reiterate that we strongly believe in the need to reduce violent crime and in taking all measures necessary to do that. Our concern is that much of the content of the clauses that relate to firearms will not reduce gun crime in practice. The effective way to reduce violent crime in communities and on the streets where gun crime and gun culture pose such a threat and airguns are misused is to enforce existing laws, not to introduce legislation that will complicate the law in ways more likely to affect the law-abiding majority than the criminals.</p>
<p>Will the clause&#039;s clamp-down on 17-year-olds owning air weapons combat the gun culture that we are all so concerned about? We do not think so. Being tough on crime means reducing crime in practice, not just talking tough on crime in Committee Rooms when discussing clauses that are not going to do their job. Since we last discussed the clause, the Minister has not explained how it is likely to reduce violent crime. Following our consultation on the issue, we believe that it should be removed from the Bill. That view has wide-ranging support from those who practise the sport, including the British Association for Shooting &nbsp; and Conservation, which has 123,000 members, and the British Shooting Sports Council, the umbrella organisation for the major shooting associations in the United Kingdom, which represents, through direct membership or as a result of affiliation to associations, the interests of some 750,000 certificate holders and an even greater number of other people. </p>

<p> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that he is hardly describing utterly independent and impartial organisations? He is describing people who have a vested interest in the sale, maintenance and use of weapons, so naturally it makes sense to them to allow the widest possible population of users.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.4.17" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" speakername="Jonathan Djanogly" time="10:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s02.htm" colnum="212">
<p> I am describing people who love the sport of shooting, and I am sorry to have to tell the hon. Gentleman that they, too, have a right to be heard. Many hon. Members have made the point that the vast majority of those who own the 7 million airguns in this country are law-abiding people whose voice deserves to be heard.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that raising the age at which somebody may own or hire an airgun from 17 to 18 will have a material effect on violent crime. Where does the magical age of 18 come from? Where is the statistical evidence proving that 17-year-olds are not able to prevent themselves from committing gun crimes? Are 18-year-olds so much more responsible than 17-year-olds? Tightening restrictions penalises the shooting community with no evidence that that will result in any benefit such as reduced airgun misuse. Raising the age limit might make such weapons more desirable to delinquent teenagers while depriving others of the opportunity of being taught safely and responsibly to handle firearms. Training young people to shoot can be valuable in teaching them skills, discipline and responsibility. Introducing them to safe and responsible firearms use makes it far less likely that they will ever misuse guns. </p>
<p>Airguns are the entry-level guns for most new entrants to shooting sports and are crucial for the development of safe and competent gun use. Most people who shoot with a shotgun or rifle start their shooting careers as young people with airguns. If young people were prevented from having reasonable access to airguns, all shooting sports would suffer, with little or no effect on crime figures. This attack on airgun ownership constitutes a veiled attack on shooting and on entry to the sport of shooting. Scouts, cadets and schoolgoers all participate in air weapon shooting. They enjoy the sport safely and responsibly. </p>
<p>We have met the National Small-Bore Rifle Association, which estimates that some 300,000 young people regularly participate in sports involving air weapons. Indeed, 15 such sports are Olympic events: five shotgun events, six cartridge-firing events and four events involving air rifles or air pistols. Air weapon events now enjoy a greater standing than other rifle and shooting sports. It is important to realise the extent of the sports enjoyed by young people and the impact that the clause will have. The National Small-Bore Rifle Association represents more than 1,100 affiliated clubs throughout the UK and has more than 100,000 direct members, including &nbsp; some 5,000 young people aged 16 or 17 who stand to be affected by the legislation. In addition, 30,000 cadets and innumerable scouts and schoolchildren are regularly involved with air weapons. Only the weekend before last, the scout airgun championship took place, involving more than 600 competitors, all of whom were under 14. </p>
<p>Young people who are properly introduced to the sport are taught to handle weapons properly, safely and responsibly, to respect others on the range and to obey range officers. A prime example is Chris Lacey, who, through his membership of the scout movement, came to represent Great Britain at the age of just 17 at the European championships earlier this year, at which he beat the British senior record. Chris is an Olympic hopeful, if not certainty. The clause will put him, as a 17-year-old, in the absurd position of being able to drive his car lawfully to the rifle range or private farm where he practises shooting, but, arguably, of committing an offence if he takes his covered and locked air weapon with him. He certainly will not be able to purchase ammunition for it or buy a new air rifle. </p>
<p>The law will prevent young people from enjoying and perfecting some sports. Most world-class shooters of air weapons are in their late teens or early twenties. They did not just pick up an air weapon yesterday, but have been training for years; the sport is their passion. The clause attacks that. The BASC website says: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;the Home Office should produce evidence to show why excluding 17 year olds from owning an airgun will significantly reduce criminal misuse and improve public safety . . . To restrict their use given the low and declining figures for misuse in this age group is wholly disproportionate and will have little or no effect on airgun misuse.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>The Minister stated that </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;the Government believe that much of this misuse is carried out by young people and that a further increase in the age limit will help prevent this.&#039;&#039;&mdash;[Official Report, 11 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 767W.]</p>
<p>But belief is not evidence. Will the Government reassess their view if it is not corroborated by the evidence? </p>
<p>The proposed legislation creates some absurdities and anomalies. The Police Federation says that in recent years, it has noticed a </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;steady increase in the number of incidents involving weapons such as crossbows and high-powered catapults, fuelled in part by Internet sales.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>It points out that the use of such weapons can have the same effect, if not a worse one, as the misuse of air weapons and that the Bill is an ideal opportunity for the Government </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;to bring about greater consistency across the legal framework&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>in relation to firearms and other weapons. They have now proposed an amendment to increase the age limit for crossbows, but that will still be a patchwork approach. </p>
<p>The Police Federation says that if the clause is enacted, </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;the law in relation to air weapons will in effect &#039;leap-frog&#039; that of other weapons.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>It goes on to say that supply and demand, and experience, dictate that the result could be a rise in the &nbsp; sale and use of weapons such as bows and arrows and high-powered catapults. </p>
<p>Like much of part 2, the clause fails because the Government have not taken a step back and put the provisions in context. It provides that a young person will be able to buy a shotgun or rifle at age 17, but not an airgun, for which they must be 18. One may need a licence or certificate to buy a shotgun or rifle, but not to buy a slingshot, catapult or bow and arrow, all of which can be bought at 17 and are more lethal than an airgun. The Government propose to change from 17 to 18 the age at which the acquisition, purchase or possession of a crossbow becomes legal, but not for catapults, which cause more damage. That is another example of the creation of further inconsistencies when the focus should be on enforcing existing legislation. </p>
<p>Obviously, there is understandable concern about the tragic shooting of Andrew Morton with an airgun in Glasgow. That was horrific, but, thankfully, such incidents are not common. There are more than 7 million airguns in the UK, the overwhelming majority of which are used safely and responsibly. The proposals in the Bill are the equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Hon. Members should note that the offender in the tragic case of Andrew Morton was aged 27, not 14, 15, 16, 17 or even 18. That case is going through due process, so I will not comment on it further, except to say that we hope that justice will be done. We should be enforcing existing laws, not creating new ones. To say that millions of people should suffer because of what a single drug-addicted criminal does has moral legitimacy equivalent to that of a totalitarian state. Existing legislation is good enough to make the clause unnecessary. </p>
<p>At the last count 30 offences connected with the misuse of airguns existed, including having a loaded or unloaded airgun in a public place and deliberate damage being caused to property, or injury being caused to domestic pets or human beings. There is a requirement for an individual aged between 14 and 17 carrying an airgun over public land to be accompanied by an adult, and there are police powers to stop and search an individual if they have reasonable grounds to believe that he is carrying an offensive weapon. </p>
<p>The enforcement of existing legislation would be infinitely more productive than introducing the misguided provisions before us. It is obvious that all improper use of airguns should be an offence, whatever the age of the perpetrator. Tinkering with age limits does little but anger and upset people who use those guns safely and responsibly. Bizarrely, on page 11 of the Home Office consultation paper of May 2004, in relation specifically to age limits, the Home Office categorically recommended that there should be no further restrictions on the sale of airguns, because of the disproportionate enforcement effect. For those reasons, I recommend that the Committee vote against the clause. </p>

<p> I have a simple question that arises from Thursday afternoon&#039;s debate on the clause, in which I made it clear that I was</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;not convinced that any weapon of any kind should be available by mail order or over the internet.&#039;&#039;&mdash;[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 20 October 2005; c. 199.]</p>
<p>That remains my view. However, at the weekend I did some research and a point was put to me that I should like the Minister to consider: for those resident in the northern isles, and, I suspect, also for those resident in the western isles, there is only one registered dealer who&mdash;I shall try to put this tactfully&mdash;has difficulty in fulfilling orders in a timeous fashion. At the moment, those who purchase either air weapons or air ammunition may do so by mail order, which will be denied to them. They are concerned that that will have a negative impact. </p>
<p>There is clearly very low&mdash;if any&mdash;relevant crime in the areas that I am concerned about. I do not expect an answer today, but will the Minister reflect on the matter to see whether the problem can be alleviated? </p>

<p> The clause is just one of a number of measures aimed at addressing the mischief of the misuse of air weapons. We do not say that increasing the age from 17 to 18 will of itself solve the problem, but it is important. I am sure that the hon. Member for Huntingdon would acknowledge the need for the law to encompass a range of measures and police powers to make our communities as safe as they can be.</p>
<p>The misuse of air weapons is a significant problem. It causes huge distress to the public. In an earlier discussion about equivalence I think it was my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South who talked about the fact that people who misuse air weapons could terrify people, particularly older people, in their properties and that it was not equivalent to being gently reprimanded with a cricket bat&mdash;I think that was what she said&mdash;or a slingshot, or anything analogous. </p>
<p>In 2003&ndash;04 air weapons were used in 13,756 crimes, so the problem is not one of low-level behaviour. Those figures show an increase of 59 per cent. over the last seven or eight years. There were 2,400 cases of injury, including 156 cases of serious injury. Hon. Members must be aware that we are trying to deal with a significant and serious problem. </p>
<p>The hon. Member for Huntingdon is right. We do need to enforce existing laws, but, as a responsible Government, we must also identify problems and determine what measures are appropriate to deal with them. </p>

<p> Given the statistics, the Minister must have some idea of the age of the people engaged in those crimes or the number of cases in which there were injuries. We need that information in order to ascertain whether raising the age limit from 17 to 18 is likely to reduce the number of crimes or the number of injuries. The clause will have no effect if crimes are committed and injuries caused by people over 18. Nor will the clause make any difference to the statistics if the people involved are under 17 and possess the guns legally&mdash;</p>

<p> I do not have a breakdown of the statistics; the figures are not available to me. Most hon. Members accept, however, that there is a problem with the misuse of air weapons, particularly among some young people in some areas of our country. I entirely take the point made by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso). There might well be little of this sort of problem in the western isles and the northern isles, but it is a significant issue for many constituents in some of our cities and towns.</p>
<p>Young people will still be able to use air weapons in controlled conditions. Committee members will see from the matrix that I circulated, as I promised I would, that young people will be able to use air weapons if they belong to a rife or pistol club or a cadet corps, if they are shooting on a miniature rifle range, if they are supervised by someone of 21 years of age or more, or if they are on private premises with the consent of the occupier. This is not a draconian measure that says that responsible young people should never have access to air weapons. As my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North said, we want practical and effective legislation that works, which is exactly what the legislation is intended to be. </p>
<p>Much of the Bill is about trying to reduce violent crime and to change behaviour. The hon. Member for Huntingdon asked whether we would keep behaviour under review and see where problems could emerge. Of course we will. We are implementing measures that attack the mischief of people who want to act irresponsibly, but keep the situation under review if they change their behaviour. </p>

<p> The Minister said that she had no figures for the numbers of crimes committed with air rifles by people under the age of 18. Two years ago, the Government increased the age limit to 17. If she has no figures for what has happened in the meantime, on what basis is she increasing the age limit now? That is what we are trying to get at.</p>

<p> There is an age limit of 18 for the purchase of knives, as hon. Members will see when we come to the debate on knives. Again, there may well be responsible young people who want to purchase knives. We are trying to ensure that the legislation governing the possession of weapons that could be misused is coherent while also providing that the people who want to use them responsibly are perfectly entitled to do so.</p>
<p>I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that the BASC and responsible shooters have a right to have their voices heard. The Bill is about trying to strike a balance between not bearing down too heavily on the legitimate and responsible use of weapons and acknowledging that the misuse of air weapons causes huge distress, injury and damage to families in many of our communities. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman says that he does not deny that. This is one of a range of measures to try to ensure that we address the very real and significant problems of misuse that affect our communities. The &nbsp; clause will help us to do that. It will not achieve our policy directive on its own, but, taken with the other provisions, I genuinely believe that it will help us to bear down on the problem that I described.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross talked about an issue that has practical implications. I do not know whether any other premises in his area could become registered firearms dealers, but I believe that the licence fee will be £150. It may well be possible for someone else to become a registered firearms dealer, but I will see whether there are any other provisions that we might be able to consider. I understand his point, but, as I said to the hon. Member for Dundee, East, if there were a series of exceptions, we might end up with loopholes in the law. I am not suggesting that people go up to the western isles to make illegitimate purchases of air weapons&mdash;I am sure that there are many more pleasant reasons for visiting the area&mdash;but I shall look into the issue. </p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 153, in clause 27, page 29, line 19, after &#039;it&#039;, insert &#039;, intentionally or recklessly,&#039;.</p>
<p>I seek again to ask a question of the Government. The clause as a whole, I entirely agree with, and I have no question about its intention. However, I want to ask the Minister whether all points have been considered. Is it possible to discharge an air weapon from a premises unintentionally in a manner that is not reckless? If that is case, should the words intentionally or recklessly be added in order to strengthen the definition? In some very limited circumstances it is possible. I hope that we shall not have a rural versus urban split when discussing this, because the example that I would give would be of a crofter. I am sure that the Committee is aware that a croft is made up of the crofter&#039;s own land&mdash;the in by land&mdash;and common grazing, which is owned either by the estate or by the crofter. </p>

<p> Actually, as far as I am aware, although some crofters are tenants on my estate, I made an offer to all who wished to buy that they could do so, and the majority have bought their crofts. I am &nbsp; extremely pleased about that. I suspect that if I give a further answer along those lines I shall be out of order, so let me press on.</p>
<p>The first point of training for anybody who is responsibly using a firearm is safety. I well remember the first time that my father handed a shotgun to me. I lifted it, and he immediately took it back and gave me the sternest possible dressing down because I did not have it pointed either at the floor or the ceiling, which is the safe way to do it. There is an old maxim: &#039;&#039;Never never let your gun pointed be at anyone&#039;&#039;. I learnt that lesson at a tender age, and it is one that I have also imparted to my own children. </p>
<p>One of the problems that can happen with a number of firearms&mdash;not so much with shotguns but with firearms and air weapons&mdash;is an accidental discharge. One therefore holds the weapon in such a manner that should such an occurrence happen, the discharge is safe: one either points it to the ground or the sky. </p>

<p> I have listened with interest to what the hon. Gentleman had to say about the problems of accidental discharge. Has he anything to say on the question of premature discharge?</p>

<p> That is not something that I have ever encountered; it may well have happened to others.</p>
<p>It is possible that a weapon may be accidentally discharged without intent. It is equally possible that if the said crofter was standing towards the edge of his property at the time of such discharge, the projectile would land outside his premises. The unintentional discharge would therefore not be reckless, because all the safety measures would have been in place. Albeit that that is a strange circumstance to have discovered, it can take place. Do we wish to create a criminal out of that person? I suggest that we do not. </p>
<p>It was helpful to look at the explanatory note on clause 27, which is note number 170. It clearly states: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;One type of air weapon misuse involves the reckless firing of an air weapon across the boundary of premises.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>So, in the notes themselves, the definition of reckless is used to indicate the Government&#039;s intention. I ask the Minister why, if it is required in the notes, it is not required in the clause. Would it not be useful to have that definition so that the Government&#039;s intention is clear: that reckless or intentional discharge, or both, would have taken place? </p>

<p> Without indulging in the gory details, I support what the hon. Gentleman has said. We have discussed the point in relation to previous amendments, but we believe that the inclusion of the requirement of intent or recklessness is important and obvious. The mischief that the clause is aimed at remedying would not have been committed in the absence of intent or recklessness. An honest mistake or accident should not therefore attract a fixed penalty.</p>

<p> I wanted to put another scenario to the Minister. Not having the weaponry experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, I went on to the internet. On an &nbsp; American blogging site for air weapon users, there was a discussion about how one blogger used them to kill spiders on his premises. Is it not possible that, whatever an owner was shooting at, he might simply miss? It would not be intentional or reckless but merely a bad shot. The bullets could ricochet. That is a possible scenario.</p>

<p> I wanted to speak about the problems that airguns pose in communities. I pay tribute to the Gun Control Network, which has worked hard to gather information on the issue. Although most publicity goes to the sort of urban gun crime that I am most familiar with, the problems, harm and danger caused by airguns are a serious issue in communities throughout the land. As we have heard, the most recent annual figures show that more than 14,000 offences involving airguns happened in England and Wales. Such offences are a significant proportion of total firearms offences&mdash;57 per cent. in England and 43 per cent. in Scotland.</p>
<p>In England and Wales the number of offences resulting in injury has increased by more than 50 per cent. since 1998. Every month, someone is injured in an airgun accident. In the past three months, two small boys have lost their lives in airgun incidents and many other victims of such incidents have been lucky to escape without serious injury. Many of the reported incidents involved young people who were using airguns without the required supervision, which suggests problems in enforcing even the existing law, because airguns are too easily available. </p>
<p>There are regular instances of emergency services personnel being targeted by young people with airguns. That was previously thought to be an urban problem, on big estates, but there are reports of its happening throughout the country. Investigations by journalists from several newspapers have shown how easy it is for under-age boys to purchase airguns in gun shops. Despite the existing law, inappropriate checks have been made by dealers. The investigation of airguns by the American Academy of Pediatrics shows how dangerous those weapons are. </p>

<p> I entirely agree, and that is why I do not support the amendment. There are too many airguns in the hands of young children.

<p> Despite wanting to make progress on the Bill, I could have listened to the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross for some time; he made his constituency sound idyllic, and I hope to get the chance to visit it. Unfortunately, there are no crofters in Salford, although there are lots of crofts, which are derelict areas where people play.</p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman has raised an important question. The amendment would insert the words &#039;&#039;intentionally or recklessly&#039;&#039; into the definition of the offence that would be created by proposed new section 21A of the 1968 Act. Perhaps I may draw his attention to the wording. The proposed new section states: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;A person commits an offence if&mdash; </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">(a) he has with him an air weapon on any premises; and </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">(b) he uses it for firing a missile beyond those premises.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>In the debate on clause 1 about using a child to mind a weapon we discussed related issues; I think that the word &#039;&#039;uses&#039;&#039; denotes a degree of intention. It is difficult to see how it would be possible to use the gun in any other way. </p>
<p>We want to ensure that the provisions apply to people of all ages. At the moment they apply only to those under 17, so in a way what we are doing is a reversal of the process under previous clauses. We want to ensure that adults who behave in the manner in question will have committed an offence. A recent case involved two grown men who fired weapons across the boundary of other premises. It was not possible to prosecute them, and it would be helpful if that were possible. </p>
<p>One issue not raised by the hon. Members for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and for Huntingdon is that of a person shooting on one property who has permission to shoot in an adjoining field. I want to consider the matter further, so I ask the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross to withdraw the amendment but undertake to see whether we can come back with provisions to meet that situation. I am anxious not to penalise people who behave in a proper and responsible manner, but I am determined to ensure that people of any age who discharge weapons across the boundaries of premises are not allowed to do so in a manner that causes the kind of distress that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington so eloquently outlined. </p>

<p> I reiterate what I said at the start, which is that I am wholly in sympathy with intention of the clause. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington is absolutely correct; shooting across premises in urban areas is wholly unacceptable, and I totally support the Government in what they seek to do. The Minister has given me the answer that I suspected I would be given, and I am grateful for it. Highlighting the point in our deliberations gives guidance to those who have to enforce the law. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p> We support the clause. I am pleased that the Minister said in her closing remarks that it may be problematic for airgun users who shoot across to adjoining land. I am pleased also that she recognises the need slightly to tighten the clause so that individuals who are not meant to be caught by the clause are not caught. The Opposition tabled a couple of amendments to that effect&mdash;I am sure that there were good reasons for them not being selected&mdash;but I am pleased to hear that the Minister will deal with the point.</p>
<p>Adjoining pieces of land would both be premises under the Bill, and in some circumstances it may be reasonable to shoot over the border&mdash;for instance, if the owner of the second piece of land had given consent to the shooter to fire into it. Under the Bill, however, that would constitute a strict liability offence, and I think the Minister agrees that is crucial to include words such as &#039;&#039;without lawful authority or reasonable excuse&#039;&#039;. Such phrases are used throughout firearms legislation. The Government should also consider giving clear and unambiguous advice as to what would constitute lawful authority or reasonable excuse. We look forward to seeing amendments at a later stage. </p>

<p> I have little to add, except to say that I will look at the issue of adjoining premises. A range of strict liability offences already exists under firearms law. Purchasing ammunition, possessing or acquiring a shotgun and transferring ammunition without being a registered firearms dealer are all strict liability offences, so there is a good precedent for having a tough test&mdash;and rightly so.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 196, in clause 28, page 29, line 39, leave out subsection (1) and insert&mdash;</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;(1) For the purposes of this section a primer is a cap type primer, UN numbers 0044, 0377, 0378 for use with metallic small arms ammunition and shall not include any fired or inert primers or any primers manufactured for use in equipment which does not fire a projectile.&#039;. </p>
<p>Clause 28 restricts the sale of primers. Although we do not object to the general thrust of the clause, the devil again lies in the detail. Primers form an essential part of shooting equipment, and many members of the shooting community enjoy loading their own ammunition; it forms part of the overall sport. The Gun Trade Association Ltd. estimates that more than 30 million primers are sold every year in the UK, and sales of primers increase dramatically in the run-up to the shooting season. As it stands, the clause is flawed, so we have tabled various amendments. </p>
<p>After consultation with the many interested parties, technical difficulties became apparent, not least that a restriction on the sale of primers would catch distress flares, shotgun cartridges and even the air bags used by &nbsp; the motor vehicle industry. I hope that it is not the Government&#039;s intention to criminalise everyone who buys or sells modern motor cars. </p>
<p>Primers are used for reloading a wide variety of cartridges, including those used in hunting, target shooting, research into heritage firearms, historical re-enactment and living history. Reloading allows for the production of custom-made ammunition, which enhances accuracy. That is an important animal welfare consideration, as it can increase the likelihood of instantaneous death when an animal is shot. Reloading is often the only way in which people who shoot vintage firearms can produce cartridges, as original ammunition is no longer manufactured. The forensic science service and other forensic examiners confirm that criminals rarely use reloaded ammunition. If anybody still doubts the Government&#039;s lack of expert consultation, this clause provides a clear example of the way in which they are whimsically legislating without first seeking proper advice. </p>
<p>It is necessary to define primers in subsection (1). After a certain amount of the sort of consultation that seems not to have been carried out by the Government, we think that the most sensible option is the United Nations definition relating to metallic cap-type primers. The UN numbers for primers for cartridges are 0044, 0377 and 0378. Those numbers are grouped within different hazard classification bands, and it is therefore logical to define primers within this Bill as cap-type primers UN numbers 0044, 0377 and 0378 for use with metallic small-arms ammunition. Such a definition would catch the potentially dangerous primers that are clearly intended to be caught by the Bill, but exempt those used for shotguns, security flares and car airbags. Also excluded in our definition are </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;any fired or inert primers, or any primers manufactured for use in equipment which does not fire a projectile.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>That is particularly important for re-enactment societies, theatre companies and film producers, all of which use blank-firing weapons. Many war veterans have spent shells from the second world war and many blank-firing weapons are used in organised heritage fairs. The clause should be drafted so as not to cover such acceptable uses. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for having raised the matter&mdash;it sounds moderately sensible&mdash;and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>
<p>It is clearly the Government&#039;s intention to ensure that persons who are not in any of the categories listed should not be in a position to acquire a primer. Can the Minister clarify whether somebody who is a firearms certificate holder and who reloads ammunition will be able to go on purchasing primers? Further, will those who do not hold firearms certificates, but who have shotgun certificates and load their own ammunition, be able to purchase primers, or does the absence from the list of the shotgun certificate mean that they are excluded? </p>

<p> I can tell the hon. Member for Huntingdon that the Government are not &nbsp; whimsically legislating. The legislation is framed so that it is practical and effective. I have taken the trouble to look at primers and ammunition-loading presses, imitations and deactivated weapons. This is not an area in which I am an expert, but I wanted to make sure before I came to the Committee that I had some understanding&mdash;albeit not as deep as that of those who are involved with such matters every day&mdash;of what we are trying to do.</p>
<p>Complete rounds of ammunition are subject to certificate control. Components are not&mdash;they can be purchased by anybody. The Committee will agree that we should not allow that situation to persist. Some criminal gangs seek to avoid prosecution by keeping ammunition in its component form and putting it together just before they go out to commit criminal acts. I am mindful of the case of David Bieber, who shot and killed P.C. Broadhurst in 2003. He was found in possession of home-made as well as commercial ammunition. We take the issue seriously. </p>
<p>Cartridge cases, lead bullets and smokeless powder are all necessary to make ammunition, but the end product is essentially inert unless it has a primer. It is on that that we want to concentrate our efforts. We recognise that reloading ammunition is an important part of rifle-shooting sports, and that around 20 million primers are sold to law-abiding shooters. We have therefore tried to be proportionate in our efforts to control the situation, and to ensure that only people with a legitimate need for primers should be able to purchase them. Many dealers already ask to see a firearms certificate before they will sell such items, but we want to enshrine that good practice in law by making it a statutory requirement. </p>
<p>We do not want to go wider than we have to, and are mainly concerned about the type of ammunition used in weapons such as handguns and sub-machine guns. I accept that the reloading of shotgun cartridges and the use of primers with muzzle-loading arms is rarely a problem. We do not want to include fired or inert primers, although it is arguable that they are not included because they cannot ignite the powder charge, or primer-actuated devices such as cable-cutters, nail guns, distress flares or air bags in cars. I also accept the validity of the argument that some antique firearms come cased with original primers, although there may not be many around. </p>
<p>As this area is a potential minefield for interpretation&mdash;that is not my joke; it is in my brief, so I can blame it on the relevant official&mdash;it has been suggested that the clause might be better predicated on seeking to control cap-type primers that are designed for use in metallic ammunition. That term is used in all explosives regulations and accords with UN guidance. The only point on which I take issue with the hon. Member for Huntingdon is his proposal to tie down the measure to specific numbers. I am reluctant to do that, given that they could change. </p>
<p>I am satisfied that if we were to go for a definition on controlling cap-type primers designed for use in &nbsp; metallic ammunition, that would meet our policy of intention, although it would have drafting implications for the rest of the clause. We will, therefore, introduce an amendment that narrows down the primers to those relevant to that kind of ammunition. That is not defined by UN numbers, because I want there to be flexibility to include other types of ammunition if those numbers change. With that assurance, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. </p>

<p> I shall speak to the lead amendment and amendment No. 155. We have, to an extent, already debated the issue of whether someone does something knowingly&mdash;in this case, the sale or purchase of a primer. I refer to cases for which the law might not be intended, or in which there is an unintended consequence. Would not it be possible for someone to inherit an estate and sell items to an auction house without realising that primers were included? Could not a seller be caught out by the legislation if they believed a buyer to be a legitimate purchaser, having no reason to disbelieve it?</p>

<p> There are a huge number of amendments to discuss, but I shall attempt to be brief. We accept what the hon. Lady says about amendments Nos. 154 and 155. We believe that they are prudent and would ensure that those without malice or criminal intent would not be unintentionally caught by the offence.</p>
<p>Amendments Nos. 220 to 227 would serve to clarify the Bill, which, it must be assumed, intends shotgun certificates to be included within the ambit of clause 28 (3) and (5). There seems to be no reason why shotgun certificate holders should not be able to purchase primers and load their own ammunition, which forms a large part of the sport of shooting for many people. </p>
<p>We have also tabled a series of probing amendments based on the alternatives of &nbsp; amendments Nos. 228 and 229. A requirement simply to present evidence in the form of a firearm or shotgun certificate when purchasing primers would be preferable and proportionate. It should also legislate for current best practice, which would be more commendable than adding further intricate layers to existing firearms legislation. Subsections (3) and (5) in particular need to be amended. </p>
<p>Under the Bill, the requirement to produce a certificate every time is not only an administrative burden, but carries distinct dangers. Primers are bought frequently, especially by experienced shooters, and there will often be many repeat purchases from one vendor. Our initial proposal is that the wording &#039;&#039;he produces&#039;&#039; be removed entirely from subsection (3)(c) and (d) and replaced with the less burdensome requirement of the words, </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;he shows that he is the holder of&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>Such an amendment would allow photocopies and faxed copies to be accepted by experienced vendors. </p>
<p>Although it might be sensible to have a requirement to show the original certificate on the initial purchase, it should be possible to show a photocopy or faxed copy for subsequent purchases. That is particularly desirable for mail order. Should it be thought necessary to see an original certificate, we therefore propose, after &#039;&#039;he produces the certificate&#039;&#039;, the wording: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;on initial purchase and shows that he is the holder of a certificate on any subsequent purchase from the same vendor&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>That would produce the benefit not only of ensuring that an original certificate was produced, but of reducing the length of time taken and the administrative burden. More importantly, it would reduce the number of original firearms certificates that would be sent back and forth in the post and that could therefore be intercepted by criminals. </p>
<p>Amendment No. 237 is another precautionary amendment that would ensure that potentially innocent people are not unintentionally caught by the clause. It should be a defence for a person to show that he did not know that he was selling a primer within the description of clause 28(2)(a) or (b), or that he had reasonable grounds for believing that the person to whom he sold the object fell within clause 28(3). That would give protection to the innocent salesman or the innocent buyer who might be duped into believing that someone was a registered firearms dealer, held a certificate, or had made an innocent mistake. The amendment would prevent some injustices committed by the strict application of the clause. </p>

<p> We are legislating on items that are fairly difficult to define, and we have undertaken to tighten up the wording. Although we accept that we need to do more to tighten up the drafting, we would not go so far as the amendments propose. We would make the prosecution&#039;s task difficult, if not impossible, if we introduced an element of knowingly committing the offences in clause 28 or if we provided for a defence of reasonable belief. Many of the existing firearms offences are expressed in absolute terms; I gave examples in our previous debate. Under section 1 of &nbsp; the Firearms Act 1968, it is an offence for a person to possess, to purchase or to acquire a firearm or ammunition without a firearms certificate. There is strict liability; there is no &#039;&#039;knowingly&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;reasonable belief&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>Under section 2 of the 1968 Act, it is an offence for a person to possess, to purchase or to acquire a shotgun without a shotgun certificate. Under section 3 of that Act, it is an offence for a person, by way of trade or business, to manufacture, to sell, to transfer, to repair, to test or to prove any firearm or ammunition without being registered with the police. There are also various other offences. </p>
<p>As I said, we do not want to go as far as the amendments suggest. It would be difficult to have the defences that they suggest in this part of the Bill when many of the other offences carry strict liability. It is right that people buying or selling components of ammunition or loading presses should make absolutely sure that the purchase is lawful. We have the existing offence of selling ammunition, which is based on strict liability, so the defences for selling components would be confusing and contradictory. We would leave the door open to a range of excuses about what people believed or were told and the circumstances in which sales took place. Much of the legislation involves strict liability, and the clause follows that position, so I ask hon. Members not to press those amendments. </p>
<p>The restrictions on the sale and purchase of primers in clause 28 mean that only people who hold a firearms certificate should be allowed to buy them. We are giving legislative force to what is already good practice in many cases. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross asked me about the position with regard to shotguns. By virtue of the definition in section 57 of the Firearms Act 1968, both rifles and shotguns are firearms and fall within the definition of a firearms certificate. They are lethal barrelled weapons of any description from which any shot, bullet or missile can be discharged. </p>

<p> The particular point that I was addressing was whether the holder of a shotgun certificate, who is not the holder of a firearms certificate, would be able to purchase primers for the purpose of loading shotgun ammunition.</p>

<p> Certainly there is a provision in clause 28(8) that primers and ammunition loading presses will not be sold to people unless they have the necessary authority. They must hold a certificate that authorises them to possess a firearm of the relevant kind. We want to make sure that people can buy only the components that relate to the guns for which they have a certificate. That is a proper safeguard; we do not want people to purchase primers for guns that they do not have lawful authority to possess. That is why the definition is narrow.</p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister. She is doing a splendid job of explaining, but I think that she has just explained that without the words &#039;&#039;or shotgun&#039;&#039; between firearm and certificate, the holder &nbsp; of a shotgun certificate is excluded. I am sure that that is unintentional, and rather than have a lengthy debate may I ask that she and her officials look at that and find out whether I am wrong.</p>

<p> I knew I should not have tempted the hon. Gentleman down that path. I have done my best to explain the position at this stage, and my officials are indicating that they think that our drafting is appropriate. I undertake to examine the matter in even more detail than I have done so far, and to come back to him if necessary.</p>
<p>My final point is about the production of photocopies. The hon. Member for Huntingdon suggested that there should be an initial production and then photocopies could be used&mdash;but there is a real danger here. I understand the relationships, and that buyers and sellers may know each other, but if we went into the realms of producing photocopies, that would not only take us outwith the current legislation, which talks about producing originals, but it could provide loopholes for people to falsify facsimile copies. I know that owners do not want their certificates to get dog-eared and damaged by constantly having to produce them, and we could consider the prospect of using new technology. Maybe we could have plastic cards of some kind so that firearms certificates would not, over time, become terribly used and worn. That practice may well develop. For the moment, I want to stick with insisting that people produce the proper firearms certificate. This is serious: guns and ammunition can be dangerous if they are misused. </p>

<p> I apologise for intruding on the Minister again, but there is a problem. The law is slightly different on what is required for the production of a firearms certificate and of a shotgun certificate. A firearms certificate, on purchase of firearms, is required on every occasion; a shotgun certificate is not. There is an anomaly.</p>

<p> If that is the case, I will certainly look into it. As I have said before, we are trying to direct our efforts towards the mischief that is caused. This is not a piece of general firearms legislation. We have had the review and will be coming forward with proposals for general firearms legislation. The policy intention is to narrow down the category of people who can purchase primers to people who purchase them legitimately, and to ensure that people who want to misuse them cannot obtain them. If that fact has an impact on that policy aim, I shall certainly come back to the hon. Gentleman. However, if it affects firearms legislation more generally, he will have to wait for another opportunity to pursue it.</p>

<p> I have listened carefully to the Minister, and I totally support her intention. That view overrides some of my concerns about the fact that the law might unintentionally trap somebody.

<p> These amendments are technical, and deal with Crown exemption. Only certain parts of the Firearms Act 1968 apply to persons in the service of Her Majesty, including members of the police force, who are exempt so far as possession is concerned but not in relation to the purchase or acquisition of firearms and ammunition. Section 54 slightly modifies the provisions, so that people in the service of Her Majesty can purchase or acquire firearms and ammunition for the public service without having a certificate, provided that they are authorised in writing to do so. Clauses 28 and 29 seek to limit the sale of primers and reloading equipment to certificate holders, and it is right that there should be similar restrictions on Crown servants, and that only those who are authorised should be able to purchase those items. The supplemental provisions of part 2 in clause 36(3)(d) fail to achieve that aim, and these amendments seek to address that failure.</p>

<p> The amendment provides for the exemption of those using primers for theatrical, historical, educational, and sporting purposes, and for use with other equipment&mdash;the sort of person who might buy a primer to which this section applies. Those exemptions are consistent with the Government&#039;s amendments to clause 30. As is evident from the categories that I have listed, those are people who may use primers safely and responsibly as part of their daily business and who should not be caught as an unintended consequence of the Bill. By including blank-firing gun primers the amendment will not only affect actors, museums and sports starters; it will prevent those involved in the training of security dogs from falling within the ambit of the offence.</p>
<p>Without the amendment, people who purchase primers for use in theatre, television and cinema performances, or educational or historical re-enactments will not be able to purchase the tools of their trade. Directors and assistants on war films and series such as &#039;&#039;Black Hawk Down&#039;&#039;, &#039;&#039;Saving Private Ryan&#039;&#039; and the British production &#039;&#039;Band of Brothers&#039;&#039; would be committing offences when purchasing the primers that enable realistic films to be made without danger. That is the reason for an exemption for blank-firing guns and guns that do not fire a projectile. </p>
<p>It should not be an offence to sell to people such as actors the tools of their trade. The Government have shown willingness to exempt those categories from the realistic imitation firearms offences under clause 30 and we believe that that attitude should be extended to primers. </p>

<p>I understand that many film and theatre armourers already have a certificate that will enable them to purchase primers. Our amendment to limit the definition of the primers that it will not be possible to purchase to those for metallic small arms and ammunition may well help with some categories of people who want to obtain primers. The matter is a complex one and we want to get the provisions right. </p>
<p>A small number of people may, after the tightening of the definition, still have to buy commercially made-up ammunition rather than component parts, but we want to limit that category of people as much as possible and ensure that people will be able to buy primers if they have a legitimate need for them and the proper certificates, and if those primers will not be misused to make ammunition that may be used to injure people. </p>

<p> I personally have not met such representatives, but several meetings took place with officials over the summer to discuss those issues. On 15 September a wide-ranging meeting with stakeholders was held. I have met representatives of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation and other parties, but I have not had the opportunity personally to discuss the issue that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about. However, my officials have had extensive discussions with representatives of the industry.</p>
<p>I shall consider the issues raised today and try to ensure that people in certain circumstances are not disadvantaged&mdash;I think particularly of those in the TV, film and theatre industries. I can bring something back on Report if it is necessary to do so. However, I am informed that many theatre and film armourers have certificates that enable them to purchase primers, so they will not be disadvantaged when carrying out their regular duties. If they could be, I undertake to consider the matter further. </p>

<p> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 156 and 157. Once again, we visit the issue of whether someone knowingly purchases or sells&mdash;in this case ammunition loading presses. To a great extent, we have already debated the subject, so I shall resist the temptation of mentioning the brewery that bought a pub called &#039;&#039;The Huntsman&#039;&#039; thinking that it had rifles on the wall, and not knowing that they were ammunition loading presses.</p>

<p> Clause 29 restricts the sale of ammunition loading presses and dies to all persons except those who may be permitted to purchase them by virtue of their being certificate holders, registered firearms dealers, exempt persons and so forth. It is sufficient to produce a certificate, and no recording of transactions is envisaged; again, persons may purchase on behalf of others. Offences, if committed, would be committed by both the seller and purchaser. We believe that that will serve only to penalise collectors and create a further unnecessary administrative burden yet do nothing to combat violent crime.</p>
<p>The amendments tabled by the Liberals are prudent; they would ensure that those who acted without malice or criminal intent were not unintentionally caught by this needless offence. We have debated the subject before; I do not intend to go over it again, although this is an issue that we will want to revisit at later stages. </p>

<p> We have had extensive discussions on the word &#039;&#039;knowingly&#039;&#039;, and the hon. Gentleman has indicated that he supports the Liberals&#039; position.

If the word &#039;&#039;knowingly&#039;&#039; had been included in the legislation, and a similar event occurred, could that person legitimately say, &#039;&#039;I didn&#039;t know what I was doing because I was not of sound mind&#039;&#039;?</p>

<p> No; the two cannot be compared. I shall move on.</p>
<p>In the unnecessary event that the Government want to proceed with the clause, we propose amendments Nos. 246 to 255&mdash;the same amendments on proof of possession of a firearms certificate as were proposed for the sale and purchase of primers; and we do so for the same reasons. Like our amendments to clause 28, amendments Nos. 238 to 245 serve to clarify the Bill; we assume that it was intended to include shotgun certificates within the ambit of subsections (2) and (4). </p>
<p>Amendment No. 256 is a precautionary amendment intended to ensure that innocent people are not caught unintentionally by the clause. The reasons that I gave for our proposed amendments to clause 28 apply. The amendment would prevent injustices that might arise if the clause was strictly applied. </p>
<p>I now move to amendment No. 257. Should the clause be pursued, it will be necessary to exclude antique ammunition loading presses from the legislation. Many collectors have valuable pieces that, in accordance with other firearms laws relating to antiques, should be exempted. Nothing in the 1968 Act applies to an antique firearm that is sold, transferred, purchased, acquired or possessed as a curiosity. The Government have recognised that in relation to imitation firearms, and should do the same in this clause. </p>

<p> By producing a photocopy, having originally shown the certificate. As I said in our debates on the previous clause, these are probing amendments, and this area needs to be considered further by the Government.</p>
<p>Collecting ammunition loading presses is not as rare a pleasure as one might think. There are at least three specialist books on the subject, and numerous articles in the shooting and collecting press. The clause will decrease the value of such collections, as it will limit potential purchasers of such items to those who hold certificates. Should our proposed exemption be ignored, the Government should address the issue of &nbsp; compensation for those who hold such valuable collections. </p>

<p> I have some qualms about the clause, and the amendments go to the heart of the matter. During our debates on primers, the Minister said that the Government&#039;s reason for referring to them in the Bill, rather than lead, powder, shot or any other component parts, was that the primer is not inert&mdash;I suppose that makes it &#039;&#039;ert&#039;&#039;&mdash;and is the active component that makes ammunition work. To reverse that argument, an ammunition press is useless without any of the component parts that make up the ammunition. I am therefore interested to know why ammunition presses are included. There may be a valid reason, but the provision seems too onerous.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Huntingdon asked about certificates. A firearms certificate must be produced on every occasion, largely because expanding ammunition is, rightly or wrongly, considered to be so lethal as to demand that approach. It is different for shotgun ammunition if one regularly uses the same dealer. When one first produces one&#039;s certificate, the dealer is obliged to record that one has one, and its number. If one returns the next week for more cartridges, it is up to him whether one should again have to produce the certificate. One does not necessarily have to produce it, because he can say, &#039;&#039;I know you; you&#039;re an honourable person.&#039;&#039; </p>
<p>My questions about the difference between shotgun certificates and firearms certificates pertain as much to this clause as to the previous one, but the Minister said that she would look into the matter, so I will not pursue it further. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.10.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" speakername="Hazel Blears" time="12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s08.htm" colnum="235">
<p> We had a lengthy debate on similar issues on the previous clause, but I shall add another comment for the benefit of the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone). In order to prosecute someone, the Crown Prosecution Service must be convinced that there is a realistic prospect of conviction, and that it is in the public interest to prosecute that person. Those are important tests and safeguards in criminal law. There may be strict liability for some offences, but the public interest test must still be passed. I hope that the hon. Lady is reassured by the extra check that the Crown Prosecution Service has before it prosecutes the very rare case of someone who has got into difficulty because of inadvertent behaviour.</p>
<p>I certainly do not accept the words &#039;&#039;knowingly&#039;&#039;, &#039;&#039;recklessly&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;intentionally&#039;&#039; in the hon. Lady&#039;s amendments, because the people involved in this trade are responsible for taking every possible precaution to ensure that they are selling things to people who are properly authorised to have them. We are not talking about selling soap powder; we are talking about component parts such as ammunition and ammunition loading presses. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said that such presses were inert, but they greatly facilitate the reloading of ammunition. Again, I am sure that many reputable dealers would ask for certificates, but we want to ensure that that is a statutory requirement. As I said, &nbsp; the provisions deal with goods that could facilitate the assembling of ammunition and that could be dangerous if they fell into the wrong hands. </p>
<p>Amendment No. 257 deals with the separate issue of antique loading presses. I know that there are people who avidly collect a whole range of antique gun-related items, and the amendment would ensure that antique loading presses could not be sold to people who did not have a certificate. I am prepared to consider that matter to see whether there is something that we can do. </p>
<p>In preparing for the Bill, I learned that there is an extensive trade in cartridge cases. I had no idea that people collected them, but they do. Again, we do not intend to bear down on people who engage in proper and legitimate activities, so I shall consider tabling amendments on Report to address that issue. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.10.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" speakername="Jonathan Djanogly" time="12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s08.htm" colnum="237">
<p> Although we thank the Government for agreeing to our proposal for a review of the legislation on antique presses, we still fundamentally &nbsp; believe that the clause poses serious problems, because it does not work.</p>
<p>Thousands of shooting sportsmen use ammunition loading presses and dies for several reasons, including saving money, helping the environment and improving accuracy. The ability to reload can save up to 50 per cent. of the cost of factory ammunition, so clay pigeon shooters, for example, who use a significant number of shotgun cartridges, will save a lot of money. </p>
<p>In the absence of clear and workable definitions from the Government, the courts will have to decide what a loading press or a die is in strict legal terms. A loading press is not defined except in so far as the definition includes dies for such presses. There is no clarification, for example, of whether hand loading tools such as decapping and recapping tools, which are designed to exert pressure on a cartridge case, are covered. If they are, a question arises about antique accessories, including those contained within antique and vintage gun cases, as the sale and purchase of those would be restricted to certificate holders. The Bill would also restrict the resale of modern second-hand reloading presses. </p>
<p>We believe that it is unnecessary to restrict the sale of what is essentially a piece of engineering equipment that contains no explosive component and is not capable of discharging any missile. If the sale of primers is to be restricted by clause 28, clause 29 is rendered pointless, because ammunition cannot be made without primers. Indeed, the Minister said that herself. Many firearms that are not subject to any certification control are contained in original cases, with a full complement of accessories that often include reloading equipment. Under clause 29, people who collect cased antique guns will have to apply for certificates to cover the reloading equipment in the cases. That is disproportionate to the perceived risk. </p>
<p>A further problem with the clause is the fact that ammunition can be pressed at home with nothing more than a hammer, a length of wire and a small vice. In view of that, how will the clause have any impact on the determined criminal, who may prefer that approach in any event? For two reasons, clause 29 is unnecessary. First, ammunition presses are wholly useless without the primers, and, secondly, ammunition can be pressed at home without a press. Had the Government had any sort of expert advice on the matter, they would not, we believe, have included the clause in the Bill. </p>
<p>In addition, I note again the need for compensation in respect of loss suffered in consequence of the exercise of a power under clause 29. Reloading equipment for ammunition has been in existence since the 1870s, when the centre-fire cartridge became the predominant form of firearms ignition. Antique reloading equipment is avidly collected and over the past decade has grown significantly in value. An Erskine patent reloading machine and its accessories will easily command £1,000. Collecting ammunition reloading equipment is a legitimate activity that makes a positive contribution to the preservation of British heritage. Most firearms auctions routinely offer antique reloading equipment, &nbsp; and Christie&#039;s has held a sale devoted solely to antique reloading equipment and gun tools. </p>
<p>Perhaps because of the bitter memories of the enormous cost and incompetent handling of the compensation scheme relating to handguns following the ban in 1997, the Government seem to have swept the issue of compensation under the carpet. Hon. Members should be aware of the additional cost to the police and prosecution authorities that the clause will entail, as well as the significant effect on business sales. Collectors and existing holders of ammunition loading presses should be compensated for the loss of value of their possessions under the clause. They should not be punished financially for the actions of criminals. I therefore ask hon. Members to vote against the clause. </p>

<p> I have two things to say. First, I have already given an undertaking that we shall consider the question of antiques and collectors with a view to finding a wording that will meet the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns. Secondly, a more general point is that it is a serious matter if people want to purchase modern ammunition presses that can facilitate the making of ammunition. I do not see why those people should not be required to produce certificates if that is the business in which they are engaged. Making ammunition that can be fired in guns is dealing with something dangerous.</p>
<p>I do not say that people who use the equipment legitimately will do so dangerously; I am sure that they will do so responsibly. However, we are considering not a harmless product but guns, ammunition, ammunition loading presses and primers. It is perfectly proper to require people to produce a certificate. I have undertaken to reconsider the arrangements for people who would be unlikely to have a certificate because they are in another category&mdash;that of antique collectors. On that basis, I ask hon. Members to support the clause. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.12.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" speakername="Hazel Blears" time="12:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s09.htm" colnum="239">
<p> The Secretary of State acknowledged on Second Reading that defining an imitation firearm had always been difficult. I am sure that this debate will illustrate exactly that.</p>
<p>We started from the definition in section 57(4) of the Firearms Act 1968, which states that an </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;imitation firearm is any thing which has the appearance of being a firearm . . . whether or not it is capable of discharging any shot, bullet or other missile.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>That was our starting point. It is a wide definition that works because its application is tied in with a qualifying provision that relates either to the weapon&#039;s design when it is readily convertible or to its misuse when it is used to cause fear of unlawful violence. </p>
<p>A ban is a serious step to take, and I acknowledge that. A ban on manufacture, sale and import is a major step forward. It is right to try to narrow down the broad definition of an imitation weapon. We have narrowed it down to those that are indistinguishable from an existing make or model of a real gun or a generic type of firearm. Our formulation for that is in subsections (8) and (9) of clause 30. Since the Bill was published we have given considerable thought to how we might clarify the definition. We are aware of the fact that it will have an impact on a range of legitimate uses of imitations. </p>
<p>We are not attracted by the proposition in amendments Nos. 266 and 267 that the definition of an imitation should be limited to those that could be mistaken for a section 1 firearm or prohibited firearm under section 5(1) of the 1968 Act. That would leave out shotguns, and I am sorry that the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross is not in his place, as he has certainly been instructive during our deliberations on shotguns. Although I accept that even real shotguns are not frequently used in crime, we would not want people to go round in possession of an imitation shotgun without challenge. Neither would we want them to be able to walk around with imitation air weapons. I hope that the amendments will help the &nbsp; Committee to understand what we are looking to ban and what we may allow to be sold in the future. </p>
<p>In new clause 21, we have sought to introduce a greater element of objectivity into the meaning of &#039;&#039;realistic&#039;&#039; imitation firearm. Subsections (8) and (9), which currently define &#039;&#039;realistic&#039;&#039; in clause 30 are reproduced in part in the new clause. In addition, we are making it clear that size, shape and colour should be taken into account. We are trying to be as detailed as we can to give people some certainty. </p>
<p>In essence, we want to establish that where the predominant colour of the surface of the imitation is a bright colour, it should not be regarded as realistic. That said, we do not think that it would be appropriate to use imprecise terms such as &#039;&#039;bright red&#039;&#039; to describe what might be allowed, particularly in primary legislation. Instead, we think that it should be left to regulations to specify which colours are unrealistic. In that way, it should be possible to avoid disputes about distinctions such as those between red, crimson and scarlet. Specifying colours by reference to British standard paint numbers will probably be more accurate than using our simple lay understanding of colours and will provide some objectivity. </p>
<p>We accept that something that is made of transparent material should not be regarded as realistic, and clause 9 means that that can be dealt with in regulations. That is not to say that an item that does not conform with the regulations cannot be regarded as distinguishable from the real thing, but it does mean that those items that meet the regulations will definitely be regarded as not realistic; it gives certainty about the specifications that will be considered. </p>
<p>My officials have given me examples of realistic imitations, those that are likely to be realistic and some that might fall between the two. I do not have enough copies for all Committee members, but they are welcome to pass them around and look at them; they are very colourful. I found them helpful in terms of what is realistic&mdash;dark, black metal, similar to the kind of gun that most of us would consider to be a realistic imitation&mdash;and what is an imitation but not realistic, such as a transparent gun, which looks like a Star Trek phaser; it has the shape of a gun but one can see through it. In 30 or 40 years, as technology develops, that may well be a realistic imitation, but for the moment it is not. Then there are those that cannot be imitations because they do not look like guns. They are in bright colours, they are generally children&#039;s toys, and they are not covered by the definitions. If hon. Members would find it useful, I shall leave the copies out and they can look at them before this afternoon&#039;s sitting. </p>
<p>We have also tried to narrow down the definition, because some imitations might be so small that they would not pose a threat if misused. Again, let us think about mischief such as people going into shops and holding guns to people&#039;s heads, causing a huge amount of distress. If a gun is so small that it is not likely to pose a threat, it is likely that a court would rule that it is not realistic because it is so small. To avoid unnecessary court cases, it is right to introduce a &nbsp; threshold: 38 mm by 70 mm is absolutely tiny, so a gun of that size would be unlikely to intimidate people unless it had been produced by Q for James Bond. </p>
<p>We are also providing for an exemption for deactivated firearms and for certain antique imitations, as well as for imitations of firearms made before 1870&mdash;our definition of a modern firearm being one made after 1870. </p>
<p>In moving our amendments and inviting hon. Members to withdraw theirs, I recognise that a range of issues might benefit from further examination. We have worked hard to narrow down the definition, because we know that the matter is of great public interest and we want to ensure that we get it absolutely right. Hon. Members may have concerns about deactivated weapons. One of the reasons for the exemption is that we do not want to discourage people from deactivating real weapons. If there were to be no exemption, deactivating a real gun would turn it into a realistic imitation, which would be banned. We have an interest in ensuring that real guns are deactivated to the point at which they cannot be used to cause harm in our communities. </p>
<p>We are also aware that deactivated guns can legitimately be used on military vehicles or as part of a display. The hon. Member for Huntingdon mentioned collectors. I have seen some deactivated guns that are worth a considerable amount of money, and there are active collectors out there. I hope that hon. Members will realise that we are genuinely trying to strike the right balance. We have a very real problem with people using imitation weapons, now that they are no longer using real weapons to the same extent. They are changing their behaviour and using imitation weapons that are almost indistinguishable from real ones. I can only imagine the trauma of shopkeepers and others going about their lawful business and being threatened with that kind of weapon. </p>
<p>I genuinely believe that the legislation is drafted in a way that addresses that particular mischief. I am sure that we will have an interesting debate about all the amendments and the issues that they highlight. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment. </p>

<p> As the Minister rightly said, the issue of imitation firearms is fraught with difficulty. We believe that this hasty legislation has been poorly thought through and without proper consultation. Clearly, there is no way in which the Government could have consulted before today on the new clause, which they tabled only last Wednesday. They certainly have not given us the opportunity to consult on it. I can tell the Minister, however, that we have consulted widely on the clause and that I have received hundreds of letters from interested parties.</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman complains that the legislation was drafted hastily. Does he know how long some of us, and in particular the Police Federation, have campaigned for a ban on imitation weapons? Some of us would say that the legislation was not drafted too hastily, but is overdue.</p>

<p> I appreciate how long certain people, not least the hon. Lady, have been pushing for this &nbsp; legislation. She must recognise, however, that the Government introduced it in the most unconsultative manner that one could ever imagine. I do not blame her for that, but that is the situation that we have been left with, and she might like to discuss that privately with the Minister after the sitting.</p>
<p>I must say, however, that the Government&#039;s last-minute amendments really have saved the clause from totally ruining the leisure pursuits and even the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people in this country. The Minister talked away quite smoothly what amounts to a huge climbdown by the Government, but it is still a climbdown. </p>
<p>That deactivated weapons should be exempted from the scope of the clause is welcome, as is the Government&#039;s belated recognition of the interests of galleries, museums, theatres, the film industry, television and historical re-enactment groups. That it should have taken the Government this long to realise their untenable position was simply staggering, however, and the lack of notice given to the Opposition about the Government&#039;s amendments was unacceptable. </p>

<p> May I direct the hon. Gentleman to clause 30(2)(a)? The original version of the Bill says:</p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;The Secretary of State may by regulations . . . provide for exceptions and exemptions&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>Surely he accepts that we always intended to propose exceptions and exemptions, as we realised that this was a difficult area of law and that we needed to listen to the representations that we all received in the summer months from various concerned groups. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2005-10-13_B_06-0_2005-10-25a.12.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" speakername="Jonathan Djanogly" time="12:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051025/am/51025s10.htm" colnum="242">
<p> I am afraid that the Minister is now digging the hole that she started earlier. What she says might be written into the Bill, but we received no notice of the Government&#039;s intentions in this regard. Tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people in this country have been put out and have been very concerned by the Government&#039;s lack of notice of their proposals. The fact that we heard only last Wednesday in no way makes me happier. For that reason, we shall table several amendments to this part of the Bill in order to limit the effect that we still believe it will have on law-abiding businesses and lawful pastimes.</p>
<p>Following enactment of the Bill, it will be possible to own a realistic imitation firearm, and also to make a gift of one&mdash;but that is it; no one will be able purchase one, because it will be illegal to sell them in the UK, although we need to investigate the non-UK position, which we shall come to later. </p>
<p>Based on consultation with the British Association for Shooting and Conservation and the Gun Trade Association, it seems that there may be as many as 30 million imitation firearms in the UK&mdash;excluding toys, of which there are between 30 million and 50 million. According to the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the replica firearms market has doubled in value since 1999; it is estimated to be worth between £30 million and £40 million a year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government say in the regulatory impact assessment that the estimated sale of blank firers and soft air guns is about 350,000 per annum. If realistic toys were included, that number could be at least doubled. A ban on the sale of imitation weapons would affect a number of companies in the supply chain, from importers to those involved in distribution and sale. It is important that we realise the magnitude of the change when considering how to regulate imitation firearms. </p>
<p>The Home Office regulatory impact assessment says that an amendment to firearms legislation to prohibit the sale of imitation firearms to under-18s could cause an estimated loss of sales of between £15 million and £20 million. A ban on the sale and manufacture of realistic imitations would cause an identical loss of sales. Having spoken to the industry, we believe that those figures are conservative. </p>
<p>Despite the Government&#039;s belated recognition of several respectable and law-abiding interest groups, my objective is to ensure that their and others&#039; interests are properly represented, and that those groups are excluded from the scope of the Bill as categorically as possible and that their pursuits and activities are as unaffected as possible. </p>
<p>Although it is good that the Government realise the serious but unintended potential of the clause to harm groups such as re-enactors and museums, the Government&#039;s approach merely provides such groups with a defence to a criminal offence. That is not fair on law-abiding citizens, who should have been exempted from the scope of the Bill from the outset. What about the interests of private collectors who want to realise the value of their collections, and those who participate in the sport of airsoft? We believe that their interests remain unaddressed by the Government&#039;s amendments. </p>
<p>Government amendment No. 300 is welcome in that it allows the deactivation of weapons to continue. Coupled with new clause 21, it excludes deactivated weapons from the scope of the clause. It is amazing that it has taken the Government so long to do that, which highlights the lack of proper thought and consultation. Antique firearms, too, are excluded from the definition of realistic imitation firearms. What about the imitation of antiques that have not been deactivated, which are used to fire blanks? They are commonly used in historical re-enactments and films. I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with that matter. </p>
<p>Much of the Bill applies to imitation firearms and not just to realistic imitation firearms. Will toys, bananas or even table legs be included in the broad definition of an imitation firearm as opposed to a &#039;&#039;realistic&#039;&#039; imitation firearm? In March this year, Robert Downey used a banana in a blue carrier bag to threaten William Claridges Ltd. in Tower Hamlets. He was heard to say that if he did not get the money he would shoot the staff. </p>
<p>Then there was the man carrying a table leg, who was shot by an officer who mistook the table leg for a &nbsp; gun. Harry Stanley, a 46-year-old, was shot in the head in 1999. He was walking home from a pub in Hackney in east London with a table leg in a plastic bag when someone, thinking that Stanley was carrying a sawn-off shot gun, called the police. The police claimed that they shouted, &#039;&#039;Stop&mdash;armed police!&#039;&#039; When Mr. Stanley turned around, they fired. </p>
<p>There was also the recently reported case of a 10-year-old boy in Salisbury allegedly being threatened with arrest by armed police officers for using a cap gun in the street during a game of cowboys and Indians. </p>
<p>Such scenarios illustrate the immense difficulty and the possible absurdities of trying to create a workable definition of &#039;&#039;imitation&#039;&#039;, and the need to consult interested bodies and a variety of experts. If a courgette or a water pistol can pass as a firearm in a dark alley, then the whole exercise of creating a subjective definition could be futile. In the right context, virtually anything could be confused with a firearm. In any event, there are plenty of other offences that would cover a banana being used in a robbery&mdash;such as that of robbery, for instance. The Government are on the verge of making it an offence to carry a banana in public place. </p>

<p> I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, and he has talked about the interests of businesses and historical re-enactment societies&mdash;but why does he not talk about the interests of the taxpayer, who has to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds every year on firearms units being called out to incidents in which it turns out that the young person involved has an imitation weapon?

<p>On Second Reading it was acknowledged that the definition is difficult, but that should not deter us from finding one. In its consultation paper, &#039;&#039;Controls on Firearms&#039;&#039;, the Home Office says that previous suggestions included placing restrictions on the sale of imitations. It goes on: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;These options have been rejected in the past because of impracticalities of enforcement. It has proved difficult to find a workable legal definition of an &#039;imitation firearm&#039; and we do not believe that the level of effort required by agencies to administer additional restrictions is offset by public safety gains. This is why we introduced the new offence of possession in a public place without legal authority or reasonable excuse. We do not therefore propose that imitations are licensed or their sales restricted.&#039;&#039;</p>

<p> It would be nice to see the results of the Home Office consultation, but we have not had that pleasure. I have made a freedom of information request to the Minister for details of that consultation, but we have received nothing. The hon. Gentleman might be making an interesting point, but if we had &nbsp; seen the returns on the evidence he might have a better point. In the meantime, I return to the original document and ask why the Home Office has had such a dramatic turnabout on this issue, especially without any further evidence&mdash;certainly none that has been given to us. Where is the evidence to support that dramatic change of tune? Why are we not waiting to see the impact of the new offence of possessing an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, which was created by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003?</p>

<p> My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) reminds me that earlier in the debate, the Minister advised the Committee how wonderfully the Government are doing in this area. Perhaps the hon. Lady thinks otherwise; I would be interested to hear what the Minister thinks of her figures.</p>
<p>Many interested parties have written to me say that they support wholeheartedly any action that will reduce violent crime, and that they will obey any law that is passed, but none of them can fathom how the proposals will reduce violent crime. How will they remove the difficulties encountered by the police? How will they stop them incorrectly shooting a young man with what they think is a real gun but turns out to be an imitation? </p>
<p>The purpose of amendments Nos. 266 and 267 is to refine the definition of a &#039;&#039;realistic imitation firearm&#039;&#039;. By including in the definition that it must be capable of being mistaken for a firearm for which a firearm certificate or the authority of the Secretary of State would be required, we would prevent this and other clauses from capturing toys and weapons that they are not intended to capture. The amendment would make the definition more stringent, and would refine it sensibly so that it would not encompass guns that are not a threat. </p>
<p>The proposed formulation is consistent with existing firearms legislation, particularly section 1 of the Firearms Act 1982, which provides for an imitation firearm to be treated as a real firearm in law. The amendment would mean that an air weapon must not look like a firearm for which a certificate would be required, but that a paintball gun would not be caught by the definition unless it looked like a gun for which a firearms certificate would be required. The Minister did not give much of an explanation as to why that would not work. She said that her problem was that shotguns would not be covered. Would she be more amenable to the amendment if it were expanded to cover them? </p>
<p>For the reasons that I have discussed, amendment No. 266 would alter the definition of imitation firearms for the purposes of the Bill only, but the wider amendment No. 267 would alter the definition of imitation firearms in the Firearms Act 1968 and, therefore, across the raft of firearms legislation. We &nbsp; think that that might be preferable, to avoid further anomalies in the firearms legislation. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that the Government have now dedicated an entire clause to the definition of a realistic imitation firearm, we cannot stress enough that that will not avoid the anomalies that I have described. No matter how complicated the definition is made, if a table leg can be mistaken for a firearm the effectiveness of the amendments must surely remain in doubt. How are the police expected to enforce this complex clause in practice? It seems to be asking a lot of the police force. For those reasons I shall consider pressing amendment No. 266 to a vote. </p>

<p> I hope to catch your eye later on clause stand part, Mr. Benton, but I want to support the Government amendments too. For a long time some of us&mdash;led by the Police Federation, I remind Opposition Members&mdash;have called for a ban on imitation firearms, and for a long time we have been told about the problem of definition. I support the Government in their attempt to deal with that problem and respond to the demand for a ban on imitations. Because the Government are a listening Government, as debate progresses they may want to table further amendments. However, I congratulate them on dealing with the issue of definition without letting it stop the important policy thrust of stopping the growth in the use of imitation weapons in crimes.</p>

<p> What the Government are trying to do is valid, and I support it. The amendments were late, but better late than never. They are important because they protect people who need protection. Having served on the Metropolitan police authority and visited SO19 I have some experience of imitation firearms. I well remember walking into a room in which there were pairs of guns, one of each pair being imitation and the other real. There was no way of distinguishing between them other than by lifting them up, when the weight and the feel of the material was different. That is what the Government are trying to tackle.</p>
<p>Will the Minister clarify a point? My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) wrote to the right hon. Lady about one of her constituents and received a reply telling her that </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;The Bill looks to ban the importation, manufacture and sale of realistic imitation firearms. It does not look to ban their possession and legitimate use.&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>I wonder if the Minister will define their legitimate use. Will she also clarify&mdash;she has already mentioned military vehicles&mdash;that military vehicle owners will be able to exhibit their vehicles as they always have, with deactivated weapons on display? </p>

<p> I refer the hon. Member for Huntingdon to new clause 21 and ask him to accept that the Government are trying to arrive at as close a definition as possible, to deal with the mischief at which the Bill is aimed&mdash;the misuse of realistic imitation weapons.</p>
<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, there has for a long time been reluctance to introduce measures of this &nbsp; kind because of the difficulty of arriving at a workable definition. All our amendments have been aimed at giving legitimate owners some certainty about what will or will not be caught by the provisions, and to narrow down the definition. Clause 30 would have enabled us to deal with those matters by regulation&mdash;but rather than go down that path, I have endeavoured to put into the Bill as much as I can about colour, shape and size, to give people a good indication of what will be caught. </p>
<p>I ask the hon. Member for Huntingdon to look carefully at new clause 21. A realistic imitation firearm is defined as one that: </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;has an appearance that is so realistic as to make it indistinguishable, for all practical purposes, from a real firearm&#039;&#039;.</p>
<p>That is a good workable definition. The hon. Gentleman raised some spurious issues about the use of items such as bananas to threaten people, but these clauses concern manufacture, sale and import, not use or possession. We seek to cap off the supply, so as to prevent the increase in numbers of such items, while recognising that some will continue to circulate. We want to ensure that we do not find millions more of them on the streets, able to be used in dreadful ways. </p>
<p>If people use items to threaten other people, they might well be committing any of a range of criminal offences, such as using threatening or intimidating behaviour or other public order offences. However, we are discussing manufacture, sale and import, not use. Therefore, I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that I found his questionable remarks about the use of table legs and other such items disappointing. I wish that he had addressed the amendment. </p>
<p>The hon. Gentleman asked why we were taking these steps. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, the incidence of imitation firearms use has increased by 55 per cent.&mdash;and in the latest figures by 28 per cent.&mdash;but the use of real weapons has been reduced dramatically: shotguns down by 13 per cent., handguns down by 8 per cent., and 14 per cent. fewer people have been killed by real firearms. Criminals are changing their behaviour. They are moving out of real weapons into imitations, so we want to cap off the supply of imitations to prevent their continued manufacture, sale, import and use. There is a real problem, and I would have hoped that all parties would unite in trying to find a workable definition that does not penalise law-abiding citizens&mdash;that is not what we want to do. We are determined to reduce the availability of realistic imitations that can be used in our communities. </p>
<p>I am not aware of the letter from the hon. Friend of the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, but I shall undertake to search for it and give her an appropriate response at a later date. </p>

<p> I support the general thrust of the clause, but I have some difficulties with it. First, a lot of groups that engage in historical re-enactments and so on, and transfer imitation firearms from one to &nbsp; another, have genuine concerns that their activities might be stopped. The latest amendments will help to address those concerns. However, there is a large market among both groups and the individuals within them who hold deactivated weapons and sell them to each other. It is not clear from the amendments whether sale between individuals or groups will be permitted. I should like some clarification. In many cases, the weapons are quite valuable. Some individuals have extensive collections that they move around with the intention of selling them and buying other weapons. I should like to think that that trade will not be stopped.</p>
<p>Secondly, although we need to reduce the number of imitation firearms in circulation, it is probably over-egging the pudding to say that that will lead to a significant reduction in violent crime. For example, in parts of Northern Ireland there have been attempts to tighten up on dealers who sell imitation firearms, and people simply moved on to claw hammers, screwdrivers or whatever other weapon they could bring to hand to engage in the robbery of off-licences and so on. Although the provisions will help the situation, it would give the wrong picture to the public to say that they will reduce the problem totally. </p>
<p>One aspect that I do not think has been addressed is that some deactivated weapons could not possibly, and would not be, used in everyday crime. Many of the deactivated weapons that I have seen and that have been brought to my attention by groups in East Antrim have usually been of the long-arm type: Bren guns, for example. People do not hold up off-licences with that sort of gun, but many such weapons are sold between holders, and if their sale is prevented, all that that will do is stop a legitimate pursuit. It will have no effect on levels of crime. </p>
<p>I want some assurance from the Minister that sales between the holders of deactivated guns such as those, which may look like guns&mdash;indeed, they are guns&mdash;but nevertheless cannot be used to carry out a crime because they are deactivated, will not be prevented. </p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman makes a lot of important points, which I will address later.</p>
<p>I said earlier that I was minded to ask the Committee to vote on amendment No. 266. However, the Minister has clearly expressed a genuine willingness to move towards an acceptable definition&mdash;and although it is not there yet, and the Government might have introduced a level of complexity that could work against the interests of the clause, having heard her general approach I will not ask for a vote. </p>

<p> I welcome the broad support for the proposals shown by the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson). I do not think that we have ever said that any single measure will do away with violent crime at a stroke. We are trying to introduce a range of measures, which we genuinely feel will reduce it. He is right to say that in addition to dealing with realistic imitations we also need to do a huge amount of education work in our communities. We have a Connected fund that has issued lots of small grants to groups such as Mothers Against Guns all over the &nbsp; country. We have had a guns amnesty, when 40,000 guns were handed in. There is a huge amount of work to be done, but if we can cap the supply of realistic imitations in this country, that will be another helpful measure.</p>
<p>I can confirm that deactivated weapons will not be subject to the ban on manufacture, import and sale. We are aware of the collectors&#039; issues and the legitimate uses&mdash;the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green raised the issue of military vehicles and using them for display purposes. We want to direct our activity to the harm that is called by the imitations that are circulating far too widely in our communities, but we do not want to hit legitimate and responsible people. </p>
<p>Amendment agreed to. </p>

<p> Enormously valuable collections, representing some individuals&#039; pensions and sometimes even their livelihoods, could be rendered valueless by the enactment of this clause. A world war two Lewis gun would fetch around £15,000 at auction. At some point, if only on the death of the owner, such items have to be sold and the investment realised. The only hope of any financial recompense would be to export, but the practicality of that must be doubtful.</p>
<p>Clause 30 as it stands is limited to Great Britain. Unless the contrary intention appears, I believe that the position is that an Act of Parliament does not extend to the acts of Britons who are outside the UK, except in cases in which specific provision is made in regard to acts committed abroad. The whole body of the criminal law of England deals only with acts committed in England. </p>
<p>Has the Minister yet spoken to her European counterparts about the 30 million firearms that are deemed realistic, and that could now be flooding into their countries as collectors and owners attempt to &nbsp; realise lifetime investments by selling those highly valuable weapons in countries such as France, where it seems that they will be allowed to sell them legally? Does she see that as being fair on our European neighbours? Is that what the Government mean when they say that they want Britain to be at the heart of Europe? </p>
<p>In relation to amendment No. 260, if re-enactment societies&#039; deactivated weapons are to be exempt from the provisions, a large part of the problem goes away. However, if someone wanted to take their realistic imitation abroad&mdash;to a show, for example&mdash;I cannot see why they should be banned from bringing that imitation back into the country if it is not for the purposes of sale. That is why we proposed to add the words </p>
<p amendmenttext="true" amendmentlevel="unknown">&#039;&#039;for the purposes of sale or distribution&#039;&#039;</p>
<p>to the end of subsection (1)(d). </p>
<p>Amendment No. 55 would ensure that the comprehensive and non-exhaustive list of exceptions and exemptions was compiled as a matter of urgency. Despite the introduction of a defence for certain bodies, those defences do not go far enough. The amendment would help to give peace of mind to the millions of interested parties that stand to be affected by the clause. </p>
<p>We believe that amendment No. 262 is necessary to prevent further haphazard legislation of the sort that has plagued firearms law. Proper consultation with experts may go some way to limiting the damage that would be inflicted by the clause. The Government abolished the Firearms Consultative Committee and its replacement, the Firearms Advisory Committee, has yet to be seen. We believe that the Government should not continue to legislate without expert independent advice on firearms, especially where individuals&#039; criminality, and livelihoods, will be determined by what is in the regulations. </p>

<p> I am perfectly open to discussion about who should be on that committee. I simply make the point to the hon. Gentleman that by now we should have such a committee, and it does not exist. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that the FAC will be established, and will play an active role in assisting the Government in compiling the list of exceptions and exemptions?</p>
<p>The purpose of amendment No. 263 is to shift the burden of proof from the accused, who may be carrying a gun safely and responsibly, on to the prosecution to show that the accused does not fall within one of the exemptions or defences that are being created, and was indeed holding the gun for an illegal purpose. If respectable and law-abiding citizens &nbsp; are to be criminalised, albeit that they will have a defence, it should be clear and unambiguous that it is not for the re-enactor or museum owner to show that he is not guilty of the offence. It should be for the prosecution to show that that person cannot rely on the defence. </p>
<p>The amendment preserves the presumption of innocence, and will allow actors, re-enactors, collectors, airsoft participants and even museums to go about their legitimate activities without threat or constant fear of contravening these complicated provisions relating to imitation firearms. It should still prove sufficiently straightforward for the &nbsp; prosecution to show that an accused person does not fall within one of the exemptions or the defence and therefore to ensure that justice prevails. The amendment is an attempt to safeguard civil liberties. </p>
<p>Amendment No. 271 would provide for compensation for the many holders of valuable imitation firearms, as well as to the businesses that stand to lose substantial parts of their revenue due to the clauses&mdash; </p>
