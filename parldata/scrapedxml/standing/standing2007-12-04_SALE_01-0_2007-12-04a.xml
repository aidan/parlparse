<p> Before we begin, I will make a few preliminary announcements taking us through what we are going to do. I am happy for hon. Members to remove their jackets. Will they ensure that their mobile phones and pagers are turned off or switched to silent? I remind the Committee that there is a money resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given for amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments.</p>
<p>As we are still in the early days of taking oral evidence in Public Bill Committees, it might help if I briefly explain what is proposed, so that the procedure is clear. First, the Committee will be asked to consider a programme motion, which is on the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence. I am glad that the Minister has just come in as he will propose the motions. They are followed by a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private, in advance of the oral evidence session. I hope that we can take all those stages formally.</p>
<p>Assuming that the motion is agreed to, the Committee will move into private session. When we get through the formal part of our proceedings, we will ask the public to withdraw and the Committee will decide how it will ask questions. Once it has deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public can come in. At that stage, the oral evidence session will begin.</p>
<p>If the Committee agrees to the programme motion, we will hear oral evidence first. As there is only one set of witnesses, there has been a discussion, through the usual channels, that if appropriate we will take a 10-minute break and then go into the line-by-line consideration of the Bill as part of this morning&rsquo;s sitting. That has not happened before in a Public Bill Committee, and it is up to the Committee to agree to it. We have moved rooms to allow us that flexibility, should the Committee so wish. If the Committee does not agree to that, we will move into line-by-line scrutiny in the afternoon sitting. Those are decisions for the Committee.</p>

<p> With regard to the wording of the motion, what would be the procedure if, after hearing the witnesses, the Committee wishes to sit in private, perhaps to discuss the evidence? Could we proceed in that way? I am concerned that if we pass the motion, we cannot subsequently sit in private in that sitting after the witnesses have been admitted even if the Committee wishes to do so.</p>

<p> My understanding is that the answer is no. Either we will suspend at that stage and move on to line-by-line consideration, or we will come back in the afternoon sitting for line-by-line consideration. It is possible for the Committee to decide to take evidence from more witnesses as the Bill goes through the Committee and to sit in private again then. However, this is a short Bill and we do not have a lot of sittings. Coming back into a private sitting to discuss what happened in the open sitting is not possible. It will be up to hon. Members to debate the issues that are raised during the public oral evidence session.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-12-04_SALE_01-0_2007-12-04a.1.17" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" speakername="Robert Flello" time="10:44" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmpublic/sale/071204/am/71204s01.htm#071204107000026" colnum="3">
<p> The issue of the face value of the student loan book is of concern and interest to me. Historically, Governments of all persuasions have not always been as successful as we might have wished in valuing assets that have been sold off, whether one wants to look back to the 1980s or more recently. My concern is about who has valued the student loan book, and how you have made sure that that valuation is robust, so that there is no vested interest in terms of the financial markets knowing that they will ultimately pick up something that will make them a large profit at the expense of the taxpayer. Finally, regarding the future value of the student loan book, how have you projected forward to ensure that its value in future is recognised in this current valuation and that, for future sales, that value is reflected?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-12-04_SALE_01-0_2007-12-04a.1.18" nospeaker="true" time="10:44" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmpublic/sale/071204/am/71204s01.htm#071204107000027" colnum="3">
<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> I would say this, would I not, but I think that, regarding this Government&rsquo;s management of student loan finance since 1997, we have a good track record of getting the estimates correct. We already have a track record in respect of the sale of the mortgage-style student loans, where I think that we demonstrated value for money.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Bill gives us enabling powers to undertake value-for-money assessments over a long period of time and also to undertake sales of the student loan book. In order to arrive at valuations, we have undertaken those assessments internally and also with external advice, and consequently we have robust estimates. However, within the context of having enabling provisions, we have said within the forthcoming three-year comprehensive spending review that we are looking to make sales to the tune of &#163;6.3 billion. Having said that, if we do not judge that the market conditions are appropriate for those sales and we do not think that we will get value for money, those sales will not go ahead. Just because we are passing the legislation does not mean that the sales will automatically take place within a certain time scale.</p>

<p> May I ask a further question on that subject? I wonder whether or not there has been any discussion of the National Audit Office report into QinetiQ and, if there has been, has that informed your deliberations about value for money for the student loan book?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> We obviously look at all reports regarding the sale of Government assets. However, what we are looking at here is a particular type of sale where we have a robust track record. The sale of the mortgage-style loans that took place in 1998 demonstrated value for money, but I am not sitting here today saying that, by passing this Bill, we will automatically undertake x amounts of sales within y periods. It will depend on the market circumstances and on both the internal advice and the external advice that we receive about market conditions. If we cannot demonstrate value for money, the sales will not proceed.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> We undertake detailed internal assessments through my own officials in conjunction with those at the Treasury. We have also sought external commercial advice about the way in which these sales will be conducted. We will be appointing a sales adviser to administer the establishment of the special purpose vehicle that will be set up to take on board the loans that are sold. There will also be a rigorous ongoing assessment of the market conditions to determine the stage at which x amounts of loan finance are sold. Overseeing that process, the National Audit Office has already indicated that it will review the first tranche of sales and will be reporting to the Public Accounts Committee. Within that context, there is a rigorous and robust framework in place to ensure that we not only get value for money, but demonstrate that we have achieved it.</p>

<p> Further to that question and before I start my series of questions, what mechanisms are in place to test market conditions? As other people asking questions have made clear and as the Minister has said, this matter is partly about track record, but it is also partly about market conditions. It would not be beyond the wit of man to devise a set of circumstances where you could test market conditions by well-established mechanisms. Has that been done?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> Recently, there has been some market volatility. While I think that there is still some market volatility, there are indications that the situation is improving. It is crucial that I make it clear that, while we indicated in the comprehensive spending review that we intend to recoup &#163;6.3 billion from these sales over the next three-year period, that is not set in tablets of stone. A major element of the internal and external advice that we will receive will focus on the market conditions and whether they are ripe for getting best value for money. If, according to both the internal and external advice, that test is not proven and the bar is not passed, the sales will not proceed.</p>
<p>I am not sitting here today saying definitively that we will reap &#163;6.3 billion and engage in sales to reach that amount during the next three-year comprehensive spending review. That is our intention, but it is not set in tablets of stone. It will depend on the market conditions.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> There are three elements to understanding how the value-for-money equation will work. The first is that the market understands the nature of these loans because they are different from consumer credit. We have to ensure that the market &nbsp;understands their particular characteristics. The second element is to ensure that the market is functioning properly, with proper competition.</p>
<p>The third element is to do some form of value-for-money comparator, which I think is the element to which you are referring. That is to do with estimating the difference between the value for money of retaining the loans on the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet and selling them into the market. That is a complex calculation and is about trying to discount the future cash flows that will come from loan repayments, as against a lump-sum payment coming to the Government soon. Those are estimates rather than complete answers.</p>
<p>We must also factor it in that there will be some transfer of risk from the Government to the private debt owners. That element of risk will have to be given a financial value and factored into the equation. To do that, we are getting advice from our colleagues in the Treasury, speaking to the NAO and taking advice from commercial companies that can help us in the overall sale process.</p>

<p> So that someone else can get in, I will make this my last question and give respite to the hard-pressed witnesses. The point about advice and experience is presumably that the Government are drawing on precedent. We have the precedent of the sale from 1998 and 1999. What specific lessons were drawn from that? What international comparisons are there? Has this been done elsewhere and what can reasonably be learned from that? The critical thing is that we get best value for money, that we sell at the right time and that the matter is managed as effectively as possible. It would be useful, therefore, to get some feel for what the Government have learned from past experience here and elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> I will make some comments and Mike might wish to follow up. Certainly, this is a different type of sale to the 1998 sale, which had an ongoing discount arrangement. That is built into the sale price with these sales and that, in part, is because the rules governing the accounting for Government debt have changed. If we conducted this sale on the basis of the 1998 sale, we would not demonstrate that we were transferring the debt from the public to the private sector, so that is certainly different from what happened in 1998.</p>
<p>With regard to international comparisons, it is difficult to draw analogies. There are few examples of countries that have gone down the road that we have taken, where the student finance system is derived from the public sector. Obviously, there is a huge amount of student debt in the United States, but that tends to be private debt, so I am not sure that there are easily comparable international examples.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> I will follow up on the lessons to learn from previous debt sales. As the Minister said, there are significant differences between 1998-99 and &nbsp;now, but the continuing element is that there is an appetite in the market to buy debt of that sort, and that makes us confident that there will be a market for income-contingent student loans that will be sold this time around.</p>

<p> I want to ask some further questions on the answers that you have just given. First, on the point about mortgage-style loans, could you give some indication of the level of discount that was given, which you undertook to do after Second Reading? Secondly, on the point about transferring risk, is not it the case that if a student dies or goes bankrupt, the Government underwrite that risk? To what extent are we really transferring risk to the private sector?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> That is the key element that we are transferring to the private sector. Through the competitive bidding process, investors will make a judgment about the attrition rate&mdash;for want of a better phrase&mdash;that will potentially take place over the 25-year duration of the repayment of the student debt. That will take into account factors such as how often students are likely to earn more than &#163;15,000 a year, above the threshold, how often they are likely to be unemployed, how many of them might be permanently disabled and how many of them might die. In those circumstances, a judgment is reached on what is reasonable to put forward as a proposal for the sale, and that is part of the way that we demonstrate value for money.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> I think the loans will be sold with a set of fixed terms and conditions, but there are elements of risk that will transfer, as well. You mentioned that bankruptcy, death and permanent disability are reasons for the loan to be cancelled as part of those terms and conditions, but the risk associated with the loans is rather wider than that.</p>
<p>On mortgage-style loans, it is quite difficult to ascribe a precise discount because the loans were sold for face value with an interest rate subsidy that has been paid and continues to be paid because those loans are not yet all paid off. Therefore, it is quite difficult to ascribe a discount value. As the Minister mentioned, it would be unwise to say what sort of a discount the Government are prepared to take on loans this time around, before the loans sale process has not even started.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> I am a polite Minister, but I am struggling to avoid the word no. The value-for-money framework will need to demonstrate that there is enough market information about the sales for people to come forward and make reasonable proposals. We will have to make a judgment about the volatility of the market and, crucially, we will have to undertake a comparator between what the net current value of the loans will be if they are sold as opposed to remaining on the Government&rsquo;s books. It would be extremely counter-productive from a value-for-money perspective to give a greater indication than that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> In some ways it is quite difficult to make a direct comparison with the mortgage-style loan sales and the sales that are proposed this time. The mortgage-style loan sale was just a straight auction, but it was an auction with an interest rate subsidy that continued throughout the life of those loans. We are not proposing to sell the income-contingent student loans in that way. It is quite difficult simply to make a straight comparison between one and the other.</p>

<p> I am much more nervous about this than I was when the questions began. We seem to have arrived at a situation whereby we have a value of an asset that we are going to sell in parts. While there may be a proper consideration in respect of value for money, if we are determined to sell &#163;6.3 billion-worth of loans, we can vary the proportion that we sell to meet that target. That is very risky, is it not, because in a normal sale the value would be set by market conditions? This sale, regardless of market conditions, could be designed to raise &#163;6.3 billion and what will &nbsp;vary is how much of it is sold. That is not a standard transactional relationship. It gives me cause for concern. I wonder what your comments are on that.</p>

<p> In that respect, you may find that during the sale process you get some pressure from the Treasury to raise the funds that it requires to fill black holes in the CSR.

<p> To return to my previous line of questioning, there is a concern in some quarters that, when Government assets are sold&mdash;certainly, when one goes back 20 years&mdash;the financial markets, for example the merchant banks, had two attempts to make some money: one was in the form of additional profit from an asset that was perhaps sold at undervalue; the other was that they could make money from the advice that they gave and by presenting the asset to market. Can you give me some information about what proportion of the value of the sale you anticipate having to pay out in costs to make that sale? Indeed, can you give me some information about the costs of the advice that you are receiving from the independent advisers? Furthermore, how are you testing those costs to ensure that they really are value for money and that the taxpayer is not bearing a disproportionate cost as against any other person putting something to market?</p>

<p> Is not the loan purchaser therefore going to be buying a bit of a pig in a poke, because you are not surrendering the power to change the loan rules retrospectively?

The implication of your question is: why should a private purchaser go through with this process? Based on detailed external advice, we believe that there is an appetite for this type of sale. It enables investment organisations to diversify their portfolio and to get a secure level of income over a period of time. In general terms, graduates who are repaying their student loan finance are a sound source of repayers. Taking all those factors into account, the advice that we have indicates, and our judgment is, that there will be a market for this sort of sale.</p>

<p> What steps will you take to avoid the scandal that we had with many of the early private finance initiative contracts, where the contractors made the big money, not by delivering the service or the goods directly, but by rebundling it and selling it on when interest rates changed? Huge amounts of money were made by the private sector at the expense of the taxpayer, simply by refinancing after the PFI had been signed off.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> To be honest, I do not believe that the circumstances with this approach are identical with or analogous to PFI sales. Clearly, in the competitive bidding process, the purchaser makes a judgment about the implicit discount rate and, yes, over the course of time that can be an overestimate or an underestimate. I think that through the competitive bidding process and &nbsp;the other criteria that we are using, we will be able to demonstrate value for money. However, the Government no longer having to bear that risk by getting the private sector to bear it over the longer term is one of the advantages to the Government and the taxpayer that comes from this approach.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> I think that the loans sale is not quite the same as the PFI refinancing that you mentioned. However, we think that there will be a process by which the loans are restructured and securitised to be sold into the market in the form of bonds. We think that there are advantages in doing that. It allows investors to buy into a different sort of asset class. It allows for the matching of the investor&rsquo;s risk appetite. It also allows the adjustment of the terms of the loans to what investors would like to buy. Those three factors are important in adding value, compared with just selling the loans straight. Those processes will be an important part of the sale process.</p>
<p>The other important element is the transfer of risk from the public sector to the private sector. As I mentioned earlier, that is an important element of the overall deal.</p>

<p> I appreciate that, but many of the propositions that you just advanced are precisely those that were advanced for PFI, when many of us pointed out these sorts of difficulties. Sadly, those difficulties came to pass. Windfall profits were made, particularly on early PFI contracts, to the point where in later PFI contracts there was a kind of clawback on refinancing windfall profits. I am asking whether, to whomsoever you sell, you are going to put some kind of windfall clawback in your sale agreements, in the event that the loan purchaser, in a fast-changing marketplace, makes a windfall profit through some sort of loan refinancing, just as happened with PFI.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> Were we to put in place such a mechanism, we would not be transferring the risk in accounting terms from the public to the private sector. The aim is genuinely to transfer that risk and ensure that we get guaranteed income over the uncertainty&mdash;the projections can go up and down over time&mdash;about the amount of money gained through the ongoing income receipt from graduates repaying their loans.</p>
<p>Based upon the judgment that ministerial colleagues and I made after having received external advice, we think that we can demonstrate good value for money through that approach. However, as I said previously, this measure is not a cast-iron commitment to sale today. Our aim is to establish a set of enabling provisions that allow us to make the judgments over a period of time, reach the conclusions and to ensure that we can demonstrate value for money.</p>

<p> With respect Minister, I suggest that you should go back to your financial advisors, because you can transfer the risk on a one-way bet so that, if things start to fall apart, the loan purchaser will bear the cost, and if there is a windfall profit through refinancing, the Government can claw back some of the profit. If you have that kind of one-way bet, of course there will be a price to pay; the sale proceeds will be lower because it will be riskier for the loans purchaser. However, you can have precisely the kind of &nbsp;arrangement that we have under current PFI, whereby if things go belly-up, the PFI contractor has the problem, and if the contractor refinances and gets a windfall, the taxpayer will get some of the money back. I respectfully suggest that you go back to your advisors on that. If they are telling you that you cannot go down that route because it would not be transfer of risk, I suggest that they are wrong.</p>

We want to be able to demonstrate that we will get value for money through this action. I make the point again that the sales will not go ahead unless we are confident that we can demonstrate value for money, and the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee will be able to scrutinise the process that we will undertake.</p>

The funds will then be raised via a process of securitisation and bonds against those sales. That will allow the trading of those bonds on the markets. I think that that &nbsp;should ensure a robust income stream. I cannot rule out that, at some stage, the special purpose vehicle may be sold on, but I do not anticipate it as a likelihood.</p>

<p> Yesterday afternoon I had the pleasure of attending the graduation ceremony at Newcastle university. I notice that clause 1(4)(d) enables</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;the Secretary of State to require a loan purchaser to make specified arrangements in connection with the administration of loans&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It surprised me yesterday how many of the students, six months after graduating, had not yet found employment. The statistics show that many take up to a year to do so.</p>
<p>Using that provision, would it not be a good idea for the Secretary of State to instruct the loan companies to provide some kind of respite gap for new graduates, because while they are waiting to find employment, their student loan is still clocking up interest? Would it not be a good point at which to recognise that graduates are taking longer to find employment? As this sale is going through at the moment should we not put in some kind of provision to make things slightly easier for students?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> I do not think that there is any robust evidence that graduates are taking longer to find employment. We have increased and widened access to higher education&mdash;we have now reached an access rate of about 43 per cent. for the under-30 population. The access rate has increased significantly, yet the graduate earnings premium remains substantial and robust; on average, over the course of their working life, it is worth about &#163;100,000 more, net of taxation, for a graduate than for someone with two A-levels. I refute, based on that evidence, that graduates are taking longer to find employment.</p>
<p>However, the Government have already indicated that they intend to introduce, from next September, exactly the kind of provision that you are proposing, whereby we would institute a five-year repayment freeze for graduates on repayments of the loan to be undertaken once they have graduated. On top of that, we are substantially increasing the proportion of students who will be able to access non-repayable grants. With the changes that we have already made and those that we are introducing from next September, I think that we have a fair and progressive system of student finance. When that is put alongside the fact that applications for university for the current year are up by 6 per cent., it demonstrates that the system is working.</p>

<p> I want to pick up on some of the points that my hon. Friend Rob Marris raised. I echo what he said about having a clause that ensured that there was a windfall back to the taxpayer if anything was sold on.</p>
<p>My question relates to the transfer of risk. Perhaps I misunderstood or misheard, but you talked earlier about a contract clause being in place whereby if the threshold was increased, there would be some compensation back to a purchaser. That does not strike me as being a complete transfer of risk if there is something in there that means that the taxpayer can be tapped up for extra money or a compensation payment if the threshold is increased. Given that there is not a complete transfer of risk, why is there not something coming back the other way to ensure that if there is a windfall, a compensatory payment is made the other way?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> No. The risk at the moment to the public sector is the fact that we have to take an estimate over a long period of time about how much money will come back to the Government. We have to take account of a whole variety of factors such as the unemployment rate among graduates, the number who will be earning above the &#163;15,000 threshold, the number who will die, and the number who will be disabled. Taking all those vagaries into account from a value-for-money perspective, we judge that if we get this right, it will be a safer bet for the public purse to get that sum of income up front, which can then be spent on a range of Government priorities. That is the value-for-money assessment that we are undertaking.</p>

<p> Picking up on the points that the Minister began to talk about with regard to onward sales, could he explain that in a little more detail? I suspect that not every member of the Committee understands all the terms that were used. Can he explain what restrictions the Government intend to place on onward sales? The Bill is a little vague&mdash;it uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. When would the Secretary of State&rsquo;s prohibitions kick in? Would that refer only to the onward sales of the special purpose vehicle, or would any of those restrictions apply to the onward sale of bonds? Earlier, we discussed the terms and conditions for borrowers; how will the Government ensure that when the debt is sold on those terms and conditions would always remain the same for the borrower?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> They would be part of the contract of sale and legally enforceable. As I said earlier, a toolkit is available within the Bill to enable this and future Governments to protect the graduate interest. That may be by means of our enforcing the fact that the Secretary of State should be a party to the onward sale agreement. It may be by prohibiting further sales without the Secretary of State&rsquo;s agreement. Those mechanisms would enable us to ensure that things that we put in the initial contract are apparent in subsequent contracts, such as continuing to use the SLC for the administration and chasing of debts, and having to have recourse to the independent assessor. I think that that gives a strong degree of reassurance.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> I wonder if it would be helpful to explain what the borrowers whose debt is sold will see and experience. The Bill provides that the Secretary of State can constrain the new owner to use the Student Loans Company and HMRC to collect repayments in the same way as is done now. Borrowers whose debt is sold will see exactly the same terms and conditions, such as the &#163;15,000 threshold, the 9 per cent. of the excess condition and the 25-year cut-off. All those conditions will be reproduced for borrowers whose debt has been sold. There will be no material difference between a borrower whose debt has been sold and one whose debt has been retained by the Government. It will still be HMRC collecting the repayments and the Student Loans Company will still maintain the loan accounts.</p>
<p>The difference is in where the proceeds from the repayments will go. They will be funnelled into the SPV that owns those debts and then distributed as interest payments and principal payments to bond holders. The constraints that will be put in the contract between the Secretary of State and the owners of the debt&mdash;the special purpose vehicle&mdash;will be the use of HMRC to collect and the Student Loans Company to maintain the accounts. Also, all the terms and conditions set out in statute and regulations will apply as much to the sold loans as to the retained ones.</p>
<p>With regard to clause 3(6), imagine at the moment that the sale process will be through securitisation and a special purpose vehicle. That may be true this year, next year and the year after that, but in five years&rsquo; time it might be done by some other mechanism. Clause 3(6) provides a variety of ways in which the requirements on the owner can be laid down to ensure that the borrowers experience no material difference. The reason that subsection (6) says transfer arrangements &ldquo;may&rdquo; is that the Secretary of State will chose the appropriate way for each case. It should not say that he will do all of them, because they are alternatives.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> Yes, unless the Government wish to do that. Any future Government could undertake to do so. For instance, I know that the Conservative party is committed to a commercial rate of interest, which we are not. It is within the Government&rsquo;s discretion to vary it, but as long as they did not wish to change the terms and conditions for both public sector debt and sold debt, the same ones would be maintained through that &nbsp;contractual process, even at subsequent sale periods.

<p> On that very issue, I will speak about the arrangements of the declaration in clause 3(6). I am attracted to the spirit of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; applying to clause 3(6)(a); namely:</p>

<p class="indent">(a) prohibit the making of further transfer arrangements without the Secretary of State&rsquo;s consent&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> I will address the point now rather than later on, although I will doubtless address it later on, as well. I have debated it at length with officials. When we were drawing up the Bill, I asked why we did not enforce the provision, instead of putting it as a discretion. Let me state for the record that clause 3(6) sets out different possible ways in which the Government could ensure that they are able to maintain protection for borrowers in the case of onward sales of loans. Under the current classification rules, it is not likely that we would include in the initial contract a prohibition of transfer without the Secretary of State&rsquo;s consent. That level of control would probably not be consistent with making a proper sale and transferring the asset from the public to the private sector, but we want it in there as an option because those rules may alter over time, so it is worth having the power to do so in the future.</p>
<p>Rather, in terms of enforcement, we expect to use one or other of the alternative methods set out in clauses 3(6)(b) or (c) to ensure that the Secretary of State is a party to any future contract. That will enable the Government to ensure, for example, that a new purchaser continues to use the SLC, as I said previously, and to make the same complaints mechanism available.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions of the loans are protected because they are contained within the regulations that would come before the House. I am happy to put on the record that we will ensure that any onward sale contract continues to protect the borrower fully. If we come to debate the starred amendment, I would argue that we should resist it, as we cannot be bound to use all the methods in the Bill. Indeed, I would argue that it makes no sense to say that we must use two alternative ways of achieving the end of ensuring that the Secretary of State is party to the contract.</p>

<p> Four or five questions arise from the exchanges that have taken place. Is the reason for the sale essentially to transfer risk, or is it about realising the financial benefit from the sale of the asset?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> The underlying reason for the sale is to manage a public asset well. This is a large public asset as it stands; we have mentioned that it is worth &#163;17 billion now and will grow to &#163;25 billion in two years. The issue is how to manage that asset in the best way. The argument is that two things can be done: first, you can reduce the risk on the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet by selling the loans; and, secondly, you can at the same time helpfully raise some income, which can be used for the Government&rsquo;s other spending purposes.</p>

<p> Therefore, it is about both realising the value of the asset and transferring the risk. The Minister, however, has made it clear that the risk is very low, which makes the sale attractive. We were told that the sale is attractive because we know where people are, they have a good record of repayment and the actuarial issues that the Minister talked about&mdash;death, disease and disability&mdash;are entirely predictable. Therefore, this is a low-risk product for the private purchaser, but we are selling it because it is a high-risk product for the Government? Is that correct?</p>

That is perfectly true in terms of the value of the asset: it is absolutely right that you want to be, to some extent, commercially sensitive about the value and the likely price that would be paid for the asset.

<p> That is most helpful. With your indulgence, Miss Begg, can I just pursue this issue of resale? It is not inconceivable that, if the product is resold, it will be resold to a body or organisation underwritten by the Government.

For example, I hate to raise the name, to the embarrassment of the Minister, but the asset could be resold to Northern Rock, could it not? There is nothing to stop that happening.

<p> Yes, but the nub of what I thought that you said earlier when answering questions from Labour Members was that the principal reason for that veto was to protect the interests of those graduates who were party to this process.

I was not aware that the &nbsp;Secretary of State&rsquo;s involvement was to prohibit certain commercial decisions.</p>

<p> But it could be any organisation that was underwritten or supported by or had some involvement from Government. Any number of commercial organisations have a relationship with Government that might make resale inappropriate or certainly undesirable&mdash;not from the student&rsquo;s perspective, although that may also be true, but from the Government&rsquo;s perspective, as a matter of public policy. It seems to me that you will have a reasonable amount of control over the first sale of the product, but whether you will have any significant control over some of the subsequent commercial activities, which might in the end be unhelpful from a public interest perspective, bears further scrutiny. You must have considered that in detail.</p>

<p> Fine. I am grateful for that and for the robust repetition of what you said on Second Reading. However, recent events inevitably raise the question whether provisions for data protection in the Bill, which obviously was drafted before the particular problems that we have had, remain sufficiently robust. Therefore, I wanted to ask you on that front whether you have reviewed the provisions for data protection in the Bill, what additional measures you have considered, and what conclusions you have come to as to whether additional measures are necessary.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> Again, I made this point on Second Reading. We are committing ourselves to a process that will not start until April next year. Nevertheless, these are important and serious issues. At the top of our priorities is the importance of maintaining the security of personal information. In the context that no breaches of the protocols have taken place, and we are certain that no data have gone missing in respect of student loan administration, there was nevertheless a Government-wide review initiated by the Chancellor. My noble Friend, Lord Triesman, as the Minister responsible for the Student Loans Company, immediately initiated a review of all our procedures. That review is ongoing and I hope that within a reasonable period of time we will reach conclusions&mdash;certainly well in advance of any sales taking place next year.</p>

<p> That is understood, but you will also understand that the Committee, in scrutinising the Bill, wants to probe a little further into what the hypothetical situation for robustness might be when the Bill is finally enacted.</p>
<p>I am going to press you further on the issue of encryption. I do not need to go over this, but encryption was a key issue in the problems that took place with the missing personal data on child benefit. I want, therefore, &nbsp;to ask you two specific questions, although I do not want to bamboozle those of us who might not be as technically literate in such matters as others. First, is the level of encryption envisaged for data protection in respect of student loans similar to that which should have applied in the case of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs and the missing personal data relating to child benefit? Secondly, at what level within your Department&mdash;or the Department that will eventually supervise data protection and its potential transferral&mdash;will that encryption be supervised? I appreciate that you may not be able to be specific on those matters today; I do not know whether Mr. Hipkins can help us further on that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> Let me try to give some reassurance. Before the Committee met, I thought about areas that Members would have concerns about and anticipated that this would be one such area. Let me be clear and explicit: personal data is currently exchanged between the SLC and owners of the old mortgage-style loans electronically, using a secure virtual private network. That VPN is facilitated using an internet protocol secure encrypted tunnel and that method of data sharing is considered very robust by industry standards. Most people who have passed comment on recent events would accept that to be the case.</p>
<p>In respect of the Bill, as we plan to require purchasers of income-contingent repayment loans to use the SLC to administer and enforce the sold loans, loan account data would not need to be transferred to the purchasers for day-to-day purposes. In the event, however, that the purchasers require access to data&mdash;for example, for audit purposes&mdash;the method of data transfer would be secure and encrypted. That should provide reassurance to hon. Members on that account. As part of the Government-wide review, even though we are certain that there have been no breaches of protocol at the SLC and no data have gone missing, all processes are being reviewed.</p>

<p> That is extremely helpful. The detail is helpful. I am sure that those who are more technically literate than I am will peruse some of those details carefully. I am sorry to have to refer back to the HMRC case but, of course, it is the case on which the questions are now being focused. You will recall that one of the problems&mdash;I do not want to prejudge the outcome of any inquiry&mdash;was that it was alleged that the material was sent unencrypted by a junior official. Of course, that raises the question of the level at which encryption will be authorised and supervised. That is one question that I want to press with Mr. Hipkins.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> Clearly, a purchaser would need some individualised information to make an assessment of the price they were prepared to pay. That would be undertaken on an anonymised basis, so there would be no personal details. We are also making it clear in the Bill that the enforcement of repayments would be undertaken through the Student Loans Company in the name of the private investor. Therefore, for any of those mechanisms there would not be a need for the individual&rsquo;s information to be passed on to private investors. The only circumstances in which there may be a need for individualised, identified information would be in respect of audit and due process, and that would be in a handful of cases, relatively speaking. Again, the data protection framework would be in place. We are also increasing the criminal penalties associated with the unwarranted releasing of detailed personal data to third parties.</p>

<p> We have had some discussion about the implications of selling on loan material, and I appreciate that you, Minister, have said that, in your opinion, those implications are likely to be less than has been suggested, for the various reasons that you have given. Nevertheless, the issue may arise. If the situation were such that there was a significant selling on of debt, where does that leave us in terms of the people who buy the debt being obliged to observe whatever protections and safeguards you have originally specified to the original purchasers?</p>

However, what kind of consideration has been given to the compatibility of systems, which was the cause of recent problems? We use fairly primitive means of communication because no other means are available to us. Any data that is transferred by less than secure mechanisms regardless of intent can go astray.

<p> The original intention stated in the Budget was that the Government would raise &#163;6 billion by the end of 2010-11. The exact quotation says &ldquo;around&rdquo; &#163;6 billion, rather than at the higher end. The higher end came in on Second Reading, I think.

<p> So in fact, if we have in place a robust value for money framework, we might not sell anything by 2010-11, or if the market conditions are such that we feel it is desirable to offer more of the loan book, we might sell more than that first portion. The Government&rsquo;s plans in that regard are entirely flexible and the Bill will enable legislation to give those plans life. Is that fair?</p>

<p> Returning to the value for money framework, I pushed the Minister earlier on whether that might form part of the Bill itself, or at least part of guidance. We have returned to it time and time again this morning, and it is critical to the essence of the Bill and the determination of all Members to get the best possible outcome. Will it be in guidance? How can the value for money framework be absolutely enshrined in further considerations? You will understand that people more sceptical than me will argue that with substantial, &#163;24.2 billion public sector borrowing&mdash;&#163;6.7 billion up on last year&mdash;there will be a temptation to cash in. I have no doubts about the Minister&rsquo;s integrity in that regard, but a value for money framework would give him the extra security of knowing that he was protected from the ravages of the Treasury.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> I made the point earlier that Treasury Ministers are bound by the value for money framework in exactly the same way as I am.

Both the National Audit Office and ultimately the Public Accounts Committee will examine that statement and criteria when they judge whether we have demonstrated value for money after the sale process.

<p> I am sorry to press even further on this specific point, but the term, &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; is to a degree a subjective one.

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> It is probably worth while restating what I set out on Second Reading with respect to value for money. The Bill is about enabling a long-term programme of student loan sales, so we need to think about market conditions over the longer term, not just the short term. As far as any continuation of the current market turbulence translating into poor value for money of any sales of student loans, if those circumstances prevailed, we would not go ahead with the sale at that time. I also said that part of the value for money assessment will involve gathering full and clear market information and, crucially, assessing the value of keeping the loans in the public sector on our &nbsp;balance sheet. We need to do that in order to be able to compare bids for selling the loans against the value of holding them. Assessing those values requires a number of projections that estimate the level of repayments that would be made by borrowers stretching far into the future. We will estimate the rate at which graduates will repay and the number of loans that will be written off because, for example, the borrower has become permanently disabled. Those projections have to be based on assumptions and estimates, so there is a degree of risk built into them.</p>
<p>In assessing value for money, we also need to take into account the value of transferring that risk from the public sector to the person or the organisation who buys the loan&mdash;that is not something that lends itself to easy quantification. As a result, the assessment will need to consider a range of values based on differing assumptions and estimates of risk. That is only one part of the value for money test; the others include ensuring that the sale is competitive and that it takes place under normal market conditions. It also entails ensuring that potential bidders have enough information to make good bids&mdash;that is an important requirement, so we will make a judgment about what type of loans in general are initially being sold&mdash;and ensuring that there is a genuine transference of risk from Government to the purchasers. That is the framework within which we will make judgments. It is also the framework against which the NAO, the PAC and others will be able to judge us in the longer-term, once the sales have taken place.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> One of the issues is about whether a loan purchaser can make a good judgment about the value of a loan, which will be based mainly on the &nbsp;track record. Those loans could be valued more precisely. There is no intention to allow purchasers to say, &ldquo;I would like loans from graduates from such and such a university or from graduates doing such and such a subject&rdquo;. In that respect, we expect a random draw from the loan book. Having said that, there might be circumstances in which you would want to exclude loans. That might be the case if the loan balance is rather small&mdash;say less than &#163;100&mdash;and typically would be paid off in the normal way rather quickly. It might be sensible to exclude those loans. However, the general principle is that the loans should be able to be valued by the purchaser on the basis of a track record. That might mean loans a year or two into repayment, which would result in a rolling programme whereby, each year, when the next batch of sales comes in, you bring in an extra set of loans.</p>

<p> But one of the reasons for selling the loans and getting them off the Government&rsquo;s books is to move the risk to the private sector. From what you say, it sounds as if we will be left with the biggest risks still on our books. That does not sound like a fantastic deal for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> Let me be clear about this. We discussed with our sale&rsquo;s adviser how to get the loans on to the market. I said that it might turn out that the advice is to leave a period between when a graduate is due to repay and when the loan is put on to the market. New loans will be due for repayment every year. It is not as if there is a fixed pot of loans and that we will sell the nice ones first and be left with the rest. As the loans process continues, as new ones come on every year, and with greater experience of how they perform over time, we could gradually sell more and more.</p>

<p> I am not clear about this, so let us go back over it. You will be selling loans first that have a track record and which, therefore, will be a low risk to the purchaser. That is what you said, Minister. However, subsequently, I feel that Mr. Hipkins has backtracked.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> The default process under the income-contingent repayment system is fairly difficult to achieve because it is very clear that repayments are made through HMRC when you are in work and earning more than &#163;15,000. In the very small number of cases where there is a default, it is the responsibility of Government and whoever owns the debt to deal with that through the Student Loans Company.</p>
<p>The difference is not between high risk and low risk for determining in what order the sales take place; it is about which loans have a sufficient track record of repayment. Those who have just graduated from university and started their repayments in April the following year will not have demonstrated themselves to be robust repayers. In no sense does that mean that they will not achieve that status. It simply means that it is too early in their repayment profile for them to have demonstrated it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> Both of those sorts of loan would be in the sales process. A point I made earlier in the sitting is that we want the potential purchasers of loans to understand the sort of asset that will underpin the bonds that they will buy. Part of that is understanding how undergraduates&rsquo; salaries change over time and what the range of graduates&rsquo; salaries are. We have some track record for the portfolio overall. The intention is not to distinguish between loans that are low risk and high risk and to sell one category and not the other. The intention is to sell all of the loans. In order to get a good price for the loans, the purchasers have to understand them. We are talking about the process of &nbsp;ensuring that they understand how the loans perform in the generality so that they can put the right price on them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-12-04_SALE_01-0_2007-12-04a.1.360" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" speakername="Rob Marris" time="12:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmpublic/sale/071204/am/71204s01.htm#071204107000296" colnum="34">
<p> Rather more prosaically I want to return to clause 4(3) and the loan regulations which, as I understand, say that a Secretary of State can pay the bidding costs of a loan purchaser. Is that what it is designed to say? I am not sure why it is in the Bill.</p>
<p>The reason I raise the matter now, rather than during the course of the Bill, is because I thought that we might have a debate to clarify it a little. If it says what I think it does, then I have reservations about it. I wanted an explanation on it, but I may have misinterpreted its import.I see the Minister scratching his head, so I will carry on. It seems to say that the Secretary of State can reimburse the successful bidder for their bidding costs because of the high cost of bidding, for example on PFI contracts, although we are not going to rehearse that discussion again. However, in recent years it has happened that the Government will, on occasion, reimburse the bidding costs for a PFI contract for those bidders who are not successful. Clause 4(3) does not say that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> The measure is meant to reproduce what happens now with the Secretary of State. If an individual borrower defaults and causes the Secretary of State to spend money in order to pursue that default&mdash;that would be through the Student Loans Company&mdash;that additional expense can be reclaimed from the borrower. That is what happens now with Government-owned debt. Clause 4(3) extends that to privately owned debt. If an expense is caused by an individual borrower defaulting, that expense can also be reclaimed by the private debt owner. It simply puts the Secretary of State and the private debt owner on the same footing.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Michael Hipkins:  </span> I am sorry. The present situation is that if a borrower defaults and causes the Secretary of State expense in reclaiming the defaulted payment, that additional expense can be claimed from the borrower. The clause extends that facility to the debt owner if the debt is sold. It puts the debt owner on the same footing as the Secretary of State is now, in the event that an individual goes into default and causes costs in the recovery of that debt. It is not to do with the cost of making a bid.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> Not because it cannot be proven to be attractive over the longer run, but the evidence is not there yet. The earlier question tempted me to go down that route, but I anticipated correctly that the hon. Gentleman would want to scrutinise me on it.</p>

<p> So the answer is that we have yet to discover quite how it will work out, but we are determined to put in robust mechanisms to ensure that it works out properly and that it is unlikely to form an early part of any transaction involving the debt.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> The latter part is correct. It is not that we do not have confidence in the mechanisms that have been put in place, but that they have not had time to demonstrate their effectiveness. We have put in&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;different thresholds according to which European Union country the graduate resides in. In other countries where average earnings are significantly lower than in this country, having a &#163;15,000 per year repayment threshold might mean that the graduate never reached the repayment level. That is why we brought in a variated threshold based on the cost of living and the wages index within individual countries to ensure that, on a fair basis, if a person had a reasonable standard of living equivalent to &#163;15,000 a year in respect of prices and the cost of living within that country, he or she would nevertheless start repaying.</p>

<p> Moving swiftly from overseas to the Principality of Wales, what representations has the Minister received about the way in which the Bill extends the powers of the Welsh Assembly? I am particularly sensitive about the matter, given our earlier worries about Wales under different legislation. I have put that as euphemistically as I can.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Bill Rammell:  </span> It is an area about which I am sensitive, given that the hon. Gentleman said that I had &ldquo;form&rdquo; on the issue on Second Reading. That question was asked by the hon. Member for Brent, East. There has been discussion between my officials and those at the Welsh Assembly. The matter is about the transference of Executive power to enact the sales. The responsibility already resides with the Welsh Assembly, and my clear understanding is that colleagues there are content with the process that we are undertaking.</p>
