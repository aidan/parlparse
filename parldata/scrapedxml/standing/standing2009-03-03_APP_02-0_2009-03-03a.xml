<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-03-03_APP_02-0_2009-03-03a.1.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" speakername="Maria Miller" time="12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/appren/090303/pm/90303s01.htm#09030387000017" colnum="43">
<p> I would like to start the session by turning the attention of the witnesses to some of the practical applications of the Bill, particularly with regard to academies in the first instance. Perhaps I should direct my question first to Dr. Moynihan.</p>
<p>The Independent Academies Association wrote to the Minister, Jim Knight, on 23 February. In that letter, the IAA wrote that the Bill was &#147;deeply disturbing&#148; and cited its concern about the role of the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and of performing assessments and the duty to co-operate with children&#146;s trusts, which is also an element within the Bill. What effect will those measures have on the running of the academies in the Harris Federation?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-03-03_APP_02-0_2009-03-03a.1.12" nospeaker="true" time="12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/appren/090303/pm/90303s01.htm#09030387000019" colnum="43">
<p><span class="italic">Daniel Moynihan:</span> I am honestly not here to represent the IAA, but we support the establishment of the agency. It makes sense for the Department to have an agency to take care of academies. Clearly the Department was never meant to be a local authority, so we are perfectly happy with that and we think it will work well.</p>
<p>The key issues for us will lie in the detail of commissioning and how that will affects academies&#146; freedoms to establish sixth forms, what they can offer and how that freedom will compare to the existing situation.</p>
<p>We broadly support behaviour partnerships. The issue with them is who decides who is in the partnerships and what form they take. In some local authorities we have very effective partnerships. In others we have produced outstanding schools initially by working alone, because local provision has been so poor that we would not want to be locked into that on a compulsory basis.</p>
<p>Co-operating with children&#146;s trusts is a very good principle, as long as children&#146;s trusts focus on integrating services and making them available, in an easy way, to individual students. If it takes away the freedom of head teachers to be responsible and accountable for running their schools, that would not be such a good thing.</p>

<p>Q 108</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-03-03_APP_02-0_2009-03-03a.1.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" speakername="Maria Miller" time="12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/appren/090303/pm/90303s01.htm#09030387000023" colnum="44">
<p> You talk about potentially taking away some of the control and freedom of head teachers. Do you feel that there are elements in the Bill that may erode academies&#146; independent status?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-03-03_APP_02-0_2009-03-03a.1.15" nospeaker="true" time="12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/appren/090303/pm/90303s01.htm#09030387000024" colnum="44">
<p><span class="italic">Daniel Moynihan:</span> There are issues that need clarification. The whole issue of the commissioning of provision and the types of rights of appeal that academies will have is important to us. In one local authority, we were told by a different body from the Learning and Skills Council that we could not open sixth forms in two of our academies. It was a particularly poor part of London in terms of the staying-on rate, and the reason why we were told that was that it did not fit with the plan. Four years later we have 400 sixth-formers and an outstanding sixth form, but nothing else has changed in the area. As in that case, we would want to be sure that we had a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, and that it was clear that we could not necessarily be blocked by whatever the local plan was if it was not an entirely sensible and objective one.</p>
<p>We have experienced difficulties on other occasions when local authorities have not wanted an academy to open for political reasons and in order to protect underperforming local provision. We would want a right of appeal so that someone could look at that, and if we lost it, we lost it. But it is important that it exists.</p>

<p> May I ask Liz Reid a question? Independent schools in the Independent Schools Council are administered directly from the Department for Children, Schools and Families by a unit of about 12 civil servants. Are you happy that academies will be administered by the YPLA at a regional level?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Elizabeth Reid:</span> It makes absolute sense and, as the academies programme continues to grow, it would be anomalous and unusual for a Department of State to take direct responsibility for a very large number of schools when there are other models, both past and present, available to look at. The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust views that as a sensible provision.</p>

<p> Thank you. I accept, Dan, that you are speaking on behalf of the Harris Federation, but the SSAT has a membership across the range of academies, so do you detect, Liz, any widespread concern from the sponsors or principals of academies about the move to YPLA?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Elizabeth Reid:</span> No. In fact, I was under the impression that the Independent Academies Association had initially welcomed the proposition.

<p><span class="italic">Daniel Moynihan:</span> All academies should be part of a hard-to-place protocol whereby students who are difficult to place are shared around. Academies are academies &nbsp;because they need rapidly to improve attendance, behaviour and a range of things to do with student welfare. The question is how to do it. In many local authorities it is possible and desirable to partner with other local authority schools and the local authority and use their services rapidly to drive up standards in attendance and behaviour. You can take on professionals between you and share that. In other places, however, local schools have often been in extreme difficulty and the local authority has had no capacity. If we had partnered in those cases, it would have been a ball and chain around our necks. The issue for us is that we are happy to partner, we want to partner, but if the brief for an academy is to improve very rapidly, as some of our schools have done, we need the discretion to determine the partner.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> A vast number of local authorities are huge supporters of academies. The majority of academies probably exist because local authorities have sought them out as the best way to improve outcomes for young people in their area. Therefore, local authorities are champions of academies and are as passionate about their performance as that of any other provider. It is critical that academies&#151;which have responsibility for so many children in the area, for which the local authority is ultimately accountable&#151;are part of the conversations that create the services around that area, that create the teams around the child, to ensure that all children, particularly the most vulnerable, have the support that they need. It is critical, particularly in areas that have a lot of academies, to have the academy principals and sponsors around the table.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> I do not disagree with what Frankie has said. We see academies as being part of the diversity of schools within a local authority. In that way, we are far better able to meet the needs of young people and the parents. Because different types of schools suit &nbsp;different types of young people, we often find that academies, like other schools, are equipped to enable youngsters to fulfil their potential. Different types of youngster going to different types of school facilitate that to a far greater extent.</p>
<p>I think also that most academies are more than happy to be part of the family of schools within a local authority, engaging significantly in all sorts of partnerships&#151;from 14 to 19, behaviour and sharing panels. Yes, we are keen to ensure that the degree of autonomy that they have is maintained. As a result of that grown-up relationship, they always want to be part of and not separate from the arrangements made by the local authority. Many academies are keen not only to follow the code of admissions practice but to have admission arrangements that fit in and are not in competition with other local schools.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Daniel Moynihan:</span> The tensions certainly can be resolved. Our perspective is that the academies were built on the city technology college movement; the 15 CTCs became outstanding schools primarily because of their freedom to make decisions quickly and autonomously. It is important that that is protected in academies, but it does not mean that academies cannot work well with local authorities. It is important that academies have the freedom to manoeuvre and make their own decisions about which services they wish to use.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> There is no doubt that local authorities have welcomed the responsibility and duty to take the strategic view in terms of overall planning and of ensuring the right level of provision within each local authority. That is not going to change as a result of the way in which the Bill is structured. What I think is important in the context of the Bill is that the YPLA will take on a responsibility from the Department for those academies that are open, and also an element of performance money. I suggest that that will enable it to relate to the local authority in terms of school plans and commissioning arrangements in a far more effective and efficient way&#151;and also in a more transparent way than if it had been left within the Department, which was trying to create as well as manage by separating those that were already in place.</p>

The key mechanism that they have deployed is their own management of those schools. It does not make sense to return those schools to local authorities.

If children&#146;s trusts integrate services so that they provide the best services for the particular needs of children at the point of use, then that is a good thing. But I would not want academies to be compelled to use them in a particular way.

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> If the YPLA is a local authority sector-led body, that concern would disappear. If it is constructed in any other way, there would be some concern. We have used the phrase &#147;mission creep&#148; in the sense that the agency&#146;s duties are not wholly prescribed. There is a degree of open-endedness. For example, through performance management options, it could micro-manage services more widely. With micro-management&#151;here I have some sympathy with a strand of Dan&#146;s point&#151;you get a degree of control which removes local flexibility and the ability to vary the nature and delivery of services to suit a locality. You might not want to apply the same type of service in the same way right across a whole local authority because of the different nature of the communities and the locales you are serving.</p>
<p>The other element is a concern about how we start off&#151;quite rightly; it is supported by local government&#151;a national funding formula from 16 to 19. The YPLA could be a mechanism to extend a national formula down to 14 to 19 education, which could be very detrimental on school funding because each local authority, in conjunction with its schools forum, has determined a formula funding arrangement that best suits the local authority and its school. If you then begin to apply that between 14 and 16 you could have a detrimental and disproportionate effect on the funding available to schools &nbsp;in different types of authorities. Colleagues in the F40 Group, for example, would particularly want that to be emphasised.</p>

<p> I want to move on to children&#146;s trusts, particularly with Frankie and Les; perhaps you can both answer this.

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> I do think that greater consistency is welcome, due to the fact that we have had a good few years of experience now and therefore know a lot more about what works. Therefore, we can learn from each other about how to make things happen, but I would still say that there are real differences between areas. Therefore, we should avoid at all costs a one-size-fits-all approach. The way partnerships work, the sizes of localities, the levels of problems in localities, the vulnerability of children in terms of the numbers who are looked after and the challenges in local authorities are all very different, so the way in which we go about business is very different. However, there are some absolute core principles for how we go about commissioning across partners, joint commissioning and working in partnership. I think that the provisions in the Bill will considerably strengthen what is happening on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> I would like to add to what Frankie has said about the growing confidence that you now begin to find in many areas as children&#146;s trusts begin to bed down. It is a matter of both confidence within partnering arrangements and a greater understanding of some of the practical difficulties that each agency faces. Equally, practical benefits come from the different agencies working together on the integration of services. One of the most difficult areas to overcome has been what I call the cultural effect. In the health service, the police, local authorities and the voluntary communities sector, different cultures underpin the methods of operating in different environments. As that understanding comes and as aspects of the work force strategy become embedded in those cultures, consistency will develop. Equally important is the role of the lead member and the director of children&#146;s services in statutory accountability. Local government has welcomed aspects of the Bill: the ownership of the children and young people&#146;s plan by all those with a duty to co-operate and the membership of the children&#146;s trust. That will do more to bring about a step change in service delivery than anything else.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> When an organisation such as a children&#146;s trust has grown up, you will see a significant amount of what I call devolved accountability and devolved responsibility down to as local a level as possible. That will ensure that communities and organisations can get on day-to-day with delivering services of a high quality and meeting the needs of citizens and the wider population. When needs arise, there will be one point of contact. Within the structure, there must be an escalation procedure for reporting issues and difficulties that arise. In that way, the lead member can be held accountable. Trend analysis and information flows are important in ensuring that there is oversight at one step removed.</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion about the relationship between local safeguarding boards and children&#146;s trusts. It is essential that we retain the freedom of the local safeguarding board to fulfil its statutory duty in serious case reviews and over the quality and nature of the social care work force. That is its responsibility at the moment. However, there must be a reporting line for oversight by the children&#146;s trust. That must not infringe on the autonomy of the children&#146;s trust, but must enable clear accountability. The local authority is responsible for the outcomes of serious case reviews, such as service delivery, improvements and the resulting actions. We must make it very clear what the link is. At the moment it is confused and clarity is needed. The Bill could be an opportunity to put that in place.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> It is probably true to say that there is something everywhere that could be seen as a children&#146;s trust board, so I understand your question&#151;if the boards exist why make them statutory? But making them statutory will help to emphasise the importance of having&#151;as Les has said in answer to a few questions&#151;that partnership embedded, and of being very clear about the accountability and role of the boards. Having them as part of the statutory furniture will, I think, be helpful in that respect.</p>
<p>Linking into the previous question, most children&#146;s trust boards sit underneath the local strategic partnerships and are not the only partnership board that functions within local authorities. They link in with other partnership boards on adults, economic development and regeneration, and often safer local authority partnerships. They are part of that architecture, which secures more tightly the well-being of children and young people.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> One danger though, is that you could go a step too far in the Bill and over-prescribe the creation of the children&#146;s trust board. That is something to be wary of. Creating a statutory body is absolutely essential, as Frankie has said, but if you go too far you might complicate the governance arrangements, which would then have difficulty being married up with the sovereignty of a local authority and equally with the roles of PCT boards, which themselves have a statutory basis. The statutory framework that you set around the children&#146;s trust board should be as loose as possible and very simple in terms of the children&#146;s plan, the membership and those who have a duty to co-operate with it. Go beyond that, and I think that you will create a governance complexity that will be a disbenefit not intended by the Bill.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kieran Gordon:</span> I think that it would. I attend a number of children&#146;s trust boards in their various current guises because my service covers more than one local authority area. The Bill would be useful if it gave a greater sense of purpose, outline and focus to the business of children&#146;s trust boards. In my experience, they can cover a wide range of issues, but not to great effect, very often not making the most efficient use of people&#146;s time. There is a greater focus now, particularly since the &#147;Are we there yet?&#148; publication, and such focus is helpful. Clearer terms of reference and a clear indication of what business the board can conduct and of what responsibility each board member has to the board and not just to their own organisations would be very helpful.</p>
<p>One concern I have is that, in my experience, GPs have never attended any of the boards and head teachers are largely missing as well. The Bill seems to increase the range of partners that will be called to the board, including for example Jobcentre Plus, and there is a lot of sense in that. The worry though is that we create an even bigger board and it gets strangled by its own size. We need some way of having an efficient board that can operate with an optimum number of members, which can pull in the various range of interests from around the wider partnership body, but without making it too large.</p>

I firmly believe, on behalf of local government, that if you have that plan owned by all the agencies, there is a desire, a wish and an intent to achieve the outcomes that are enshrined in it, because they have all been though the sovereign decision-making arrangements in each of the organisations that have a duty to co-operate and which formulated the plan.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Elizabeth Reid:</span> I am happy to start. I think that we have already had a good discussion about behaviour partnerships, because they are about schools coming together to take shared responsibility. There are a number of ways of looking at this issue. It is often said, for example, that there are difficulties about the exclusion of children from schools. Most head teachers do not want to exclude children, but sometimes it appears that it is right both for the individual young person and the wider school community. If you are part of a school behaviour partnership, that is not an easier decision to make but it is a decision that can be made in a much more planned way, with some certainty that there will be proper arrangements for continuing the young person&#146;s education.</p>
<p>That is very clearly a benefit, both for the school and the individual youngster. That is why I believe that schools have voluntarily entered into behaviour partnerships in the very large numbers that they have done. There are only a handful of schools that are not part of the behaviour partnerships. So I think that the benefit of those partnerships is on the way to being proven. On that basis, I think that there is no difficulty with the proposed legislation.</p>
<p>Again, as with a great deal of the discussion this afternoon, there is some devil in the detail and that is about understanding, in all cases, what are the sensible parameters of partnership, which can vary from locality to locality because there are different kinds of issues that schools and their communities are facing.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> I will build on that by referring back to something that Dan said very articulately earlier, which is that it is everybody&#146;s responsibility; all those children are everybody&#146;s responsibility. All schools share the responsibility to ensure that more vulnerable young &nbsp;people and hard-to-place young people are shared and looked at collectively across an area. It is often the case that a young person who is finding it particularly difficult and being incredibly disruptive in one school will often thrive when given a fresh start in another. There is now lots of evidence to show that, when schools work together and manage moves in that way, young people really succeed very well, particularly when they go into a culture of high performance. I am with Liz in that respect and think that that has been proven.</p>
<p>I do think, however, that Liz is absolutely right to say again that what you legislate for and what is in the detail is incredibly important, because you need to allow local areas flexibility to do what is right for them. What is right for a London borough in which schools are located close together is very different from what is right for a big shire authority in which schools are far apart, so you cannot legislate for all the details and have to leave that to the professionals to sort out.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Daniel Moynihan:</span> For me the issue of school behaviour partnerships remains about voluntarism for academies. It is true that most schools are part of behaviour partnerships, but the kind they are in are quite different to the kind Sir Alan Steer mentions in his report. The behaviour partnerships that most schools are in are about sharing out hard to place pupils and managing moves for exclusions.</p>
<p>In this case, however, we are talking about much broader partnerships in which groups have the power to employ specialist staff together, have common behaviour management training, take on services in managing attendance, offer staff training and work with primary schools, so we could be looking at a bigger and potentially more bureaucratic process. That is fine for academies because we go in and make a rapid assessment: what is the situation? Attendance is 70 per cent; what is the local authority doing? It has good services and we want to work in partnership with it. In other cases we have had 70 per cent. attendance while the local authority was deploying its support services, so we would not want to get into a hard partnership in such cases. We really feel that it is important that we have the choice of which schools we partner with, because partnerships per say will not improve anything: quality improves things.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> I will have to disagree slightly with that because he is implying that he wants one rule for academies and another for everyone else, which is in the &nbsp;interests of neither partnerships nor, dare I say it, young people. Many local authorities not only have behaviour partnerships and sharing panels as embedded arrangements, including those with academies and grammar schools, but are developing pupil referral units and links with colleges, because for many youngsters, especially around the age of 14 and 15, a school is not the right environment emotionally. They often find that a college placement offers a far better environment, given the nature of their individual development. The partnership is therefore flexible, depending on the individual needs of the young person.</p>
<p>Also, you are able on a collective basis to provide a range of support services to assist young people and their families to address many of the problems that might not necessarily be school-based and that originate outside the school. That might be the most successful way of addressing the needs and encouraging the young person to develop. On a slightly wider basis, sometimes it is a locality&#146;s whole set of aspirations that needs to be addressed, and that needs to be understood, and often a behaviour partnership can begin to address that on a wider basis.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kieran Gordon:</span> I do not think it has. It rightly indicates that schools, which currently have a statutory responsibility to provide careers education, should reference the provision of apprenticeships in the careers education programmes and advice offered through the school and its partners. It refers to a situation where the school believes it would be in the &#147;best interests&#148; of pupils. My concern with that is there are schools, particularly schools with sixth forms, that might consider the best interests of the pupil to be in returning to the sixth form, for the purposes of the school&#146;s particular interest, rather than the individual young person&#146;s. The Bill goes some way in recognising that schools have responsibility to promote and make young people aware of apprenticeships. It does not go far enough in giving that clause teeth, although I think statutory guidance will be coming as a consequence of the Education and Skills Act. That might make it more assertive.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kieran Gordon:</span> The whole process of making career decisions has to be a fusion of different processes, starting with the careers education in the school. It is rightly and properly the responsibility of the school to make sure there is a careers education programme in place and that careers education programme covers a range of issues in terms of young people&#146;s awareness of themselves, the world of work and their awareness of their own skill needs and skill development, but yes, you are right that there needs to be independence and impartial expert advice provided by a body&#151;Connexions currently does it&#151;where there are trained career guidance experts working in partnership in the school as part of a school team, providing that impartial advice and guidance.</p>
<p>The issue we might have with apprenticeships&#151;referencing back to those schools with sixth forms&#151;is that the young people entering apprenticeships tend to be the same cadre of young people that the school wants to attract back in to do A-levels or the 16-to-19 elements of the diploma. It is where there is a conflict of interest if the school tries to confuse that choice for the young person. It may believe that it is in the best interests of the young person to go back to school, but if it does not present, and allow young people to explore, the range of other options, including apprenticeships, it may well stifle that choice for young people.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> The commissioning&#151;I presume that is what you are talking about&#151;is relevant to the discussion we have just had on information, advice and guidance. The local authority having the role of looking strategically at its provision to make sure that progression routes are in place and that there is a coherent offer, including all the diversity we have talked about, is absolutely key to delivering RPA. To be honest, I am not sure how we would do it without that. There is the knowledge that we have built up of those young people between nought and 16, but also the local authority&#146;s strategic leadership role post-19 on the economic agenda and the worklessness agenda, which they can plan coherently&#151;not on their own, but in conjunction with other local authorities, including neighbouring local authorities. That is absolutely key.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can be a bit cheeky and come in on the information, advice and guidance debate. We have strived for and talked about having provider-neutral information, advice and guidance for as long as I can remember and probably for as long as anybody in this room can &nbsp;remember. It is very difficult to legislate for that. The new climate, in which local authorities have a strategic leadership role in terms of commissioning 16 to 19 provision, gives us an opportunity that we have not had before to get all the providers around the table and to get an agreement about what is on offer in a locality and across localities. That might help to get the commitment to getting provider-neutral information, advice and guidance in schools. Even if you have the strongest careers professionals, what an individual teacher says in the classroom will have an enormous impact on what a young person does. We need to build a consensus around the shape of that provision in localities.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> Yes. If we do not achieve that, there will have been no point in introducing the reforms. But that is not a role that local authorities can or would want to play on their own; they have to do that in conjunction with their providers and they have to recognise all the things that have been said today about cherishing and protecting the autonomy of providers. It is not a matter just of the autonomy of academies, but of all schools, as well as general FE colleges and sixth-form colleges. This is not about local authorities controlling matters; it is about planning together the diversity that will lead to stronger learner choice, as well as meeting employer need, which will be critical as we positively go into an upturn coming out of the recession.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kieran Gordon:</span> I want to make a comment on Frankie&#146;s earlier point about neutral information, advice and guidance. Impartial does not mean neutral. Neutral would suggest to me some form of passive guidance. Actually, if it is done well, impartial information, advice and guidance should be a challenging process; it should be about encouraging young people to raise their aspirations and to look at the range of options, and it should sometimes be about putting them in uncomfortable positions by looking at the range of things that they could do. Impartiality is not, therefore, neutral, but very much about playing an active and challenging support role for young people.</p>

<p> I have a supplementary point to what Liz was asking Frankie, and I would like to bring Les in as well. This morning, we heard that there were concerns from sixth-form colleges and, to some extent, from FE colleges about independence and the extent to which commissioning would be impartial.

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> I can use the word &#147;neutral&#148; here, I think, but I am worried about it now. On provider-neutral commissioning, the principle that we are looking at the best-quality provision whoever provides it&#151;obviously, it will provided in the place that it is best able to provide &nbsp;it&#151;must be fundamental as we go into this new world. Keeping focused on the learner and on making sure that what we commission is learner led, while taking account of employer need, is also critical. However, it is fundamental that we look at this across providers. The provision in the Bill to require local authorities to, one, secure learner choice and diversity and, two, work across local authorities, ought to give some measure of reassurance to providers. I agree that they are understandably nervous and those of us who are engaged in what we are rather pompously calling &#147;dry runs&#148;, sitting with the Learning and Skills Council going forward, are learning a considerable amount about how we build trust. Relationships between local authorities and providers are generally very strong&#151;we have talked about academies, but also for general FE colleges&#151;but there is still nervousness.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> If elected Members began to influence things to that extent, the whole veracity of the commissioning process would be seriously undermined and would not allow for planning, in the sense of concentrating on the learner. That becomes particularly important with vulnerable young people and at what I call the &#147;age of transfer&#148;, which is now 19, in terms of the support that a young person has up to that age. In the adult arena that support is a lot less, therefore, we need to have a very strong commissioning framework that allows all partners to join with the local authorities to ensure that there is a consistency in transfer and support such that learners can continue, especially if we are talking about apprenticeships. They do not suddenly stop at 18 or 19, they go on into adult learning arrangements. With our responsibilities to those with learning difficulties up to 25, it is absolutely important that we have the depth of those relationships right and have the right commission framework, based around quality and meeting the needs of the young person first and foremost.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kieran Gordon:</span> I think that it will happen where local authorities are encouraged to work actively in a collegiate way with the local authorities covering a travel-to-work or travel-to-learn area and where providers within a local authority patch are not protected out of loyalty or whatever. It is very important that we understand that when we talk about commissioning, we are not just talking about procurement. Very often, people actually mean procurement. Commissioning must start with the learners&#146; needs. It must be based on a robust assessment of learner need, which is informed by what young people themselves and advocates, such as guidance workers, say. Understand that, look at the trend analysis, and look at the performance of providers in situ and of those that could be brought in, because good commissioning, at times, involves decommissioning provision. It is a big task for local authorities to undertake and they cannot do it in isolation.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Elizabeth Reid:</span> I think that it is entirely reasonable. As I understand the Bill, the onus is first on the local authority and it is only if the local authority fails to take or secure adequate action that the Secretary of State would seek to intervene, and the proposition is that a power should be given to a Secretary of State for that purpose.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if people do not wish to see interventions of whatever sort&#151;whether in a school or a local authority&#151;then the answer may be to speed up the efforts to move out of the zone in which that is likely. It seems to me that that is actually what is happening up and down the country and it is right and proper that that should be so. It would be desirable if there were no circumstances in which powers of intervention were necessary.</p>

<p> Thank you very much. Can I ask Les and Frankie about that? What is significant about those powers, as I understand it, is that there are already powers of intervention in this respect&#151;from the Secretary of State to a local authority&#151;but that they are based on schools that have already been categorised as requiring special measures or significant improvement.</p>
<p>Clause 192 gives much more sweeping powers, as I understand it, for the Secretary of State to make judgments about schools that he or she thinks should be doing better on various measures, and then allows intervention against the local authority in the first respect to deal with that. That brings us to the point of whether the Government are able to effectively assess schools not already picked up by Ofsted, or some other body independent of the Government, that are not performing well. Are you two happy with the powers in clause 192, or do you think that you are going to end up with unreasonable decisions for interventions being made?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Les Lawrence:</span> It is an interesting arena, because on the one hand we have been accused by the Association of School and College Leaders of interfering too much to try and up the performance of schools. On the other &nbsp;hand, there is an implication here that we have not done enough intervention to bring up school performance. The extent to which local authorities in the main have challenged schools has been variable, to be fair. To an extent, it has also been governed by the fact that the current process can be long-winded with warning notices; the extent to which you can assist through the SIP process; a warning notice plus getting the inspectors in; the extent to which there is a period for a degree of improvement; and also the power, I have to say, to be able to both remove governing bodies and/or the leadership in a school to affect change.</p>

The existing classification of schools that are not doing well may not be thorough or broad enough to capture schools that should be doing a lot better which is why the Secretary of State is giving himself these more discretionary powers, essentially to decide on skills which Ofsted is saying are okay but the Secretary of State thinks should be a lot better.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> The devil will always be in the detail. The Bill talks about standards the pupils might reasonably be expected to attain and about standards previously attained by them. It depends on the definitions attached at any time for any reason to the words. They seem completely reasonable words and it is completely reasonable to expect intervention if a local authority is not being creative, proactive and quick about turning schools around. There can be no excuse for local authorities not to be vigorous. We have sufficient powers at the moment to intervene at those schools. If you ask the Department, of course it will say that it wants the bureaucracy reduced even further, certainly where schools might not be in the local authority&#146;s bottom category but where you would still want to have powers to federate them, to remove the governing body, and you are not able to. There is a balance for when that happens. What a lot of local authorities do, in terms of school improvement, is through persuasion and negotiation.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Frankie Sulke:</span> Of all the questions I thought I might be asked, whether I trusted the Government did not come up in my preparation. There is nothing wrong with the words in the Bill. It is always possible, though obviously not for current incumbents, to imagine that the words might be used unreasonably in future. How they are interpreted in terms of what reasonably might be expected from pupils could be argued. The main principle is perfectly reasonable&#151;that local authorities ought to be doing their job in quickly turning round schools and ought to be held accountable and that the Government can intervene if that is not happening.</p>

<p> I have a final question for Les and Frankie but first can I ask for clarification from Dr. Moynihan? I have been reflecting on what he said about behaviour partnerships, that schools should determine what partnerships there are. If that is the case in terms of behaviour partnerships, if academies were in any way concerned about the objectives or did not share the objectives of children&#146;s trust boards are you implying that they should also be able to choose whether to be part of that? If they were being asked, for example, to pool funds, which was felt not to be helpful for that academy.</p>

<p> Thank you. My final question for Les and Frankie is about the LGA briefing that expressed concerns about the complexities of some of the aspects of the Bill, with the demise of the Learning and Skills Council and the establishment of a raft of new quangos&#151;the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency, the Skills Funding Agency, the National Apprenticeship Service, sub-regional groupings of local authorities, as well as local authorities being required to have statutory children&#146;s trust boards and advisory boards for children&#146;s centres to ensure they comply with these new statutory regulations. What impact do you think that is going to have on local authorities and, in particular, are there any funding implications that we should be aware of, given the difficult and tight funding regimes under which local authorities operate?</p>

<p> I want to open this part of our proceedings with a question to Kathleen Tattershall. Your memorandum to the Committee particularly draws attention to the importance of Ofqual&#146;s independence from Government. I think you say that being a non-ministerial Government Department will help to promote public confidence. I am sure that the Minister will not take that in anything other than a positive way. Ofqual clearly wants to actively guard its independence. What will you do to prevent other challenges to your independence from arising, particularly from things like the make-up of your board? Clearly individuals who write or mark exam papers, or teachers or head teachers may be seen to have vested interests or perhaps even conflicts of interests. Perhaps those who are interested in making sure that exam standards have not been seen to have fallen may not be the most impartial people to involve in the organisation. Nothing in the Bill prevents those with such conflicts from being board members of Ofqual. Do you think that Ofqual needs to look at this to make sure that the Bill is more robust in this area so that people cannot think that it is anything other than independent in all aspects of its work?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> First, as you say, independence is critical to the role of the regulator. It is very important that the Bill is seen to give us the independence that we need to carry out our functions, independent of Government as a non-ministerial Department reporting to Parliament. On appointments, there will be a very clear and public process of advertising for the individuals who are interested in our committee and ensuring, through a proper process involving the Committee on Standards in Public Life, that they make clear any interest that they might have in this area, and secondly demonstrate their willingness to manage any conflicts of interests. What we are looking for on the Ofqual board is a range of expertise, not just in education but in other areas. In populating the Ofqual board we will look for people both within and outside education, but wherever there are conflicts of interest we will also look for ways in which they will be managed.</p>

Indeed, having said what I have just said about interest, we will be looking for individuals who bring expertise and experience to the board, not representative individuals in that sense.</p>

<p> Mr. Watson, you brought that up as well in your submission from OCR, in terms of the importance of autonomy from Government. What drove that from your angle?

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> The Secretary of State was very clear in initiating the drive for an independent regulator. That was in response to comments that we and others made over a prolonged period. The intention was to put standards above suspicion. There is something that dogs the public debate every summer about a perceived involvement in how standards are set, and I think that that is exacerbated by the rate of change, potentially. We changed the qualifications system faster than we have ever done in this country, and the ever-shortening cycle and ever more frequent iterations of some of the qualifications that we trust most highly seems in itself to destabilise trust in some way.</p>
<p>I think that the clear intent in the Bill is to try to address those two issues, first by putting some clearer blue water between Ministers and decision making about standards, so there can be absolutely no allegation of any involvement of one in the other, and secondly by also being a check and balance on the tendency to change the system too often in destabilising ways. If you like, the intent is to act as a sane, slightly cautious, evidence-based evaluator of the case for change, always wondering what the risks might be as well as what the benefits might be, so that when we do change the qualifications system, we do so knowingly, understanding what risks we might be taking and taking the actions needed in order to make sure that those risks are not realised.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> Yes, absolutely. It is important, equally, that Ofqual is independent from those it regulates. I think that it is important that Ofqual should be seen to be a strong, independent voice, not simply a sort of super-exam board, if I can characterise it that way. We would very much like to see&#151;we very much advocated it&#151;a strong, vocal, visible, publicly authoritative organisation. That said, we have some concerns as to whether the Bill, as drafted, entirely delivers on that intention. It is clearly in the direction that we had hoped and there are some clear principles set out that drive for independence, but there are particular features that seem still to leave residual opportunities for a Secretary of State, now or in the future, to intervene on a rainy day. Of course, it is on a rainy day that suspicions arise about political involvement.</p>

<p> Kathleen, thank you for your note. You have highlighted areas where Ofqual might have concerns about existing legislation and the need for us to have a look at your independence. I wanted to start with a bigger-picture question rather than asking about individual powers. The Government clearly have great hopes that the new body will end the annual dumbing-down debate to which Greg just referred.</p>
<p>However, you will be aware that the Select Committee said in the conclusion to its report on testing last year that although it welcomed the establishment of your organisation,</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;the Government has failed to address the issue of the standards themselves. In the context of the current testing system, with its ever-changing curriculum and endless test reforms, no regulator, however independent, can assure assessment standards as they are not capable of accurate measurement using the data available. Until the Government allows for standardised sample testing for monitoring purposes&#148;,</p>
<p>whether by you or another regulator, there would be no resolution of the dumbing-down debate. Do you have any sympathy with those points? Would you like to have the power to carry out standardised sample testing in order to have some measure of standards that is separate from changes in the qualification regime?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> First, as far as the annual dumbing-down debate is concerned, I think that it would be foolish to expect it to end overnight because of the creation of an independent regulator. Clearly, we will do all that we can to address all the issues and bring the debate into the public arena in a very transparent and open way in order to get a better understanding of what actually goes into creating the standards of public qualifications.</p>
<p>Whether we need an explicit power to introduce other forms of sampling is more debatable. On a particular occasion down the line, we may well think that we need to look at other means to get a better view, but I am very conscious that, once you begin to think that way, you must also think of the technicalities involved in setting up a sampling process. It is not as easy as choosing the sampler and then developing a test; you have to think very carefully about how that impinges on the curriculum.</p>
<p>My understanding of the legislation is that we are not precluded from such thoughts down the line, and I do not think it particularly necessary for the Bill to give us the powers explicitly. I do not think that there is anything in it that precludes us from saying, at some point in time, that we need to look at standards in a slightly different way.</p>

<p> Are you concerned that the Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee&#146;s report stated that Ofqual&#146;s role&#151;we clearly see this in the legislation&#151;is</p>
<p class="indent">&#147;not to monitor education standards as a whole; it is to regulate the qualifications and assessments which are one of the means by which those standards are measured.&#148;</p>
<p>There is obviously a concern in the public&#146;s mind, not necessarily that there has been a deliberate attempt to undermine and cheat on standards, but that, over time, arguably because of teaching to the test, the way qualifications have changed, more or less coursework, &nbsp;or modular GCSEs, exam results do not necessarily reflect the change in educational levels among the population.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> I think that, if we are talking about Ofqual being a regulator of the educational standard system, that is a very different beast from that in the legislation, which presents Ofqual as a regulator of qualifications and national curriculum assessments. That in itself is a very broad brief; there are thousands of qualifications that come under the regulator&#146;s system. If Ofqual looked more broadly at educational standards per se, as opposed to using some sort of standardised test to inform what the qualifications framework might be, it would be a very different organisation from the one in the legislation. I am not certain whether that would give the organisation too broad a brief and get in the way of doing a good job on the qualifications front, as well as elsewhere.</p>
<p>There are other organisations that look at educational issues; Ofsted, for example, looks at the quality of teaching and what actually goes on in schools. If you go down the line of Ofqual being an educational body, as you describe, you have to look very carefully at the demarcation lines between organisations such as Ofsted and organisations such as Ofqual. Furthermore, you have to be very careful regarding the burden that you might place on schools in terms of them being answerable to more than one body.</p>

<p> For my last question, may I ask Mike and Greg whether they share any of my scepticism that the Bill&#146;s changes and the Ofqual that we are creating are actually going to end the annual dumbing-down debate? I say that not simply because it will take time for Ofqual to establish credibility, which is inevitable, but because of the fundamental job that it has been asked to do and the powers that it has.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mike Creswell:</span> The critical contribution that Ofqual could make to begin to end that debate, which will plainly take time, would be to provide much greater clarity than it has in the past about the precise meaning of the standards of qualifications. In the distinction that you draw between educational standards and monitoring students&#146; general progress on the one hand, and examination standards on the other, it is important to distinguish between the two functions that qualifications currently fulfil. One is to qualify learners, mainly young people, for progression&#151;to go on in education or employment in a way that fits their talents and abilities. For that purpose, it is reasonable that students should essentially get a grade that reflects the performance that they give when they are assessed. However, performance will vary with the context, so a performance achieved in modular examinations will be different from a performance indicated in a final exam, and performance for course work will be different from performances in exams. For the moment, the definition of standards that I believe we all hold dear is about performance during the assessment process. The job that you are asking for, that of assessing the underlying education achievements of students, is grafted on to the qualifications results, and it requires a different methodology to the sort that you outline.</p>
<p>I agree with Kathleen. To give Ofqual both these jobs would be to give it some enormously difficult work, but it can really make a difference to the qualifications &nbsp;debate if it is much clearer than anyone has been in the past about how it conceives standards, how it would measure the standards set by the awarding bodies and how it would evaluate what the awarding bodies are doing on standards. That is the critical contribution that it could make.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> The answer to your question is yes; I believe that Ofqual will in time make a difference, but it will not happen overnight. It will do so in three important ways. First, if it can achieve the unequivocal independence that we have talked about&#151;there is some way yet to go to make it certain&#151;so that its voice will resound differently in public and the statements that it makes will seen to be objective, considered and free of any other consideration than making a fair judgment on whether the qualifications hold water. That is the first thing.</p>
<p>The second thing is that Ofqual can play a role in opening up the qualifications system and making it more transparent. I think that the burden of your question was about benchmarking qualification results to other tests in order to provide some kind of external confirmation. In reality, in the examination system today we do a lot of unseen statistical work to correlate the achievements of the same learner in different subjects, the same learning across different exam boards and similar learners at different times taking the same qualification. We use a series of different measures in order to triangulate&#151;to ensure that we keep the standards in the same place. However, little of that is open to public view. An authoritative and informed regulator can play a role in making that more visible, making public the assurance that qualifications are sound.</p>
<p>The third thing is that I would expect Ofqual, as compared to its predecessor, to devote more of its efforts to scrutinising what bodies like the OCR do at the point when we are developing qualifications. As a result, we would be grilled more than we might have been in the past about how we put a qualification together, how we propose that the assessment arrangements will work, how we will set standards and what some of the challenges might be in setting that standard&#151;if, for instance, we had a change in the structure of a qualification. The very process of being challenged by a regulator at that all-important point when the qualification is created would put us on our mettle. That, too, will add to the public&#146;s confidence that it is all the more visible and accountable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-03-03_APP_02-0_2009-03-03a.1.246" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" speakername="Alison Seabeck" time="17:35" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/appren/090303/pm/90303s06.htm#09030387000214" colnum="68">
<p> We heard from Kathleen Tattershall&#146;s comments in response to the questions of the hon. Member for Yeovil that we do not necessarily need a tranche of new powers to deal with the matters that he raised. Does Ofqual need additional powers in other areas that at present are not included in the Bill, and if so what are they?</p>
<p>On a slightly different topic, are you confident that Ofqual can balance its regulatory role with ensuring efficiency and value for money in the qualifications system? Some might perceive a conflict of interest.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2009-03-03_APP_02-0_2009-03-03a.1.247" nospeaker="true" time="17:35" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmpublic/appren/090303/pm/90303s06.htm#09030387000216" colnum="69">
<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> First, our powers and responsibilities are wrapped up in three elements of the Bill. One is the objectives; you referred to those partly in terms of the efficiency objective, but there are also the standards objectives in relation to qualifications and the national curriculum assessments. Secondly, there are the conditions that we can lay down. I would expect those conditions &nbsp;to be very much linked to those objectives. Some of the general conditions that we would stipulate are all conditions about how we ensure that standards are maintained throughout the process. Greg made a reference to the very beginning of the process, about how people will set the requirements and the tests, and it seems that that is all part of the standard setting. So, the conditions will address the objectives of the standards.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there are the powers that we have, particularly the powers of direction for when the awarding body falls short. Those are powerful powers, but I stress that we want to ensure, through working with them, that the awarding bodies can begin to address thorny issues and come up with solutions that are acceptable to the regulator. So, I think that that is right. We also have powers to cap fees, but one power that we do not have, and which I discussed with the Secretary of State via an exchange of letters on 10 February, is the power to fine. The power to fine should be in the armoury of any regulator because it is an intermediate sanctioning step before the ultimate nuclear step of not recognising or taking away the recognition of an awarding body. That power is open to debate, and the Secretary of State has said that he is very open-minded about it. We argue that it would be a very useful power, if only as a deterrent, and it would prevent the use of that nuclear power at the end. The powers in this legislation, all linked as I see them to the objectives and conditions that we would lay down, help towards Ofqual being a very authoritative independent regulator. There is that power to fine, and there are arguments about whether it is explicit enough that we are talking about standards. For me that is explicit, but if others feel that it is not the Bill has to be very clear about where Ofqual stands in respect of directing standards.</p>

<p> Coming back to you Greg, you have talked about wanting greater autonomy for the regulator and about further parliamentary accountability. How would you see that happening? What would you expect Parliament to do that it cannot do already?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> There are two important areas in which Parliament could usefully play a role in increasing the transparency and accountability of Ofqual. The first is key appointments. Above and beyond what is eventually in a Bill, significance is likely to be attached to the individuals who come to occupy the senior roles, and I think that there will be a lot to be said for some scrutiny of those roles. The subject of potential conflicts of interest has come up and there will be some scope to explore what those might be. That is all part of building public confidence.</p>
<p>The second dimension that could be developed in more detail in the Bill is what Ofqual might report on annually. Rather than there being an open-ended obligation to produce a report, perhaps it should be required to report under a series of defined headings and on particular types of issues or concerns that might have arisen during the year. Perhaps, if there remains any provision for the Secretary of State to intervene in certain situations, it should report on each occasion on which the Secretary of State has used that power and for what reason.</p>

<p> I guess that I would say this as a former member of the Education and Skills Committee: I would draw an analogy between the new Ofqual and Ofsted, which &nbsp;reports directly to what was the Education and Skills Committee but is now the Children, Schools and Families Committee. Do you see a direct comparison there? Should Ofqual&#146;s accountability to Parliament be channelled through the Select Committee?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> That would be potentially helpful. The report is one element; what follows from the report is another.

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> The other benefit that we might derive from that is that there would be some sort of continuity in the public debate. Issues that emerged in one year might become part of Ofqual&#146;s published plan for the following year and the following year&#146;s discussion would reflect back on whether or not the right actions had been taken, to determine if progress had been made or if further action needed to be carried forward to the year after that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> Vocational qualifications need to be seen to represent the standards of the particular industries in which they operate. There are sector skills councils, which act as a filter for employers, to ensure that the skills and qualities which employers are looking for are well represented in the vocational field. It is important that the vocational examinations which are provided actually fulfil a purpose which employers&#151;</p>

<p><span class="italic">And</span><span class="italic">r</span><span class="italic">ew Hall:</span> I think it is fundamentally very good news for QCDA. It removes some of the potential internal mental blockages that perhaps prevented us in the past from being as rigorous as we could be in doing our delivery jobs. I remember that when I joined the organisation over two years ago, we would sit there and say we designed things for the Government, we worked closely with the Government&#151;that was part of our remit&#151;we reformed qualifications, we delivered assessments. Then in the same legal organisation, we had a potential regulator sitting there. We know from the way we operate that there was no interference, that there was independence. But the public perception was quite hard to see in that position. So I think, truthfully, it was very clear and very good news. It was my first comment when I walked through the door: why do we do this? So actually, it lets us do that. It lets us focus very clearly on perhaps adding more value to the development chain. We are clear that we can challenge the awarding bodies in another type of independent way that says we are here to provide advice and support and some creative challenge around the process, and do not have to worry about being seen to regulate ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="italic">And</span><span class="italic">r</span><span class="italic">ew Hall:</span> Seamless transitions, I think, are sometimes a dream. The reality is that there is a lot of work that has had to go into planning how we do this. As accounting officer, I am, as of today, still responsible for many of the aspects of Ofqual&#146;s accountabilities, and that is a fact of life. You cannot walk away from that. The way we dealt with that was to set up a number of internal processes that very clearly segregate what is the regulatory activity that is a process and an output and a product, and we have helped Ofqual build the capacity to do that. We have provided the legal support, the financial support and the system support to deliver what they needed to do.</p>
<p>Probably the most challenging area is around qualification development, where historically there is someone who develops the criteria that go into the qualifications that awarding bodies produce, and then regulates those criteria as they are delivered. It is in that process that we have put a considerable amount of work into developing two teams that have worked together for about six months to really tease out the nuances in there. I think we just need to continue to drive that process for however long it is until vesting day, and make sure we support the operational transfer, the systems transfer that leaves Ofqual properly resourced to go forward and do its job.</p>

<p> It seems from what you said today, from the earlier submissions, that there are three big issues: autonomy, consistency and credibility. So in turn, does the Bill, in its current form, offer sufficient &nbsp;autonomy? Some of your earlier remarks suggest that it should offer greater autonomy through the different forms of parliamentary scrutiny you described, as well as by other means. Secondly, on consistency&#151;again judging from what you have said here and elsewhere&#151;there are real issues about maintaining consistency across qualifications. One thinks of modular and non-modular qualifications, for example. How do you see that working?</p>
<p>Thirdly, in terms of credibility, is there not a poacher and game-keeper issue? What if you have people on the board that might be setting or marking, or have set or marked, exams? There is nothing to stop professors of education in educational faculties, or academics who write exam papers, from being on the board, is there? How are you going to guarantee real independence, which provides credibility, unless you sort out that potential for conflicts of interest?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> I think the question was probably addressed to me. May I take the last point, because I think that it has been covered to some extent in the earlier answers? The whole process of appointments to the Ofqual board has to be a very open, public process and one involving the Public Standards Board. Greg also helpfully mentioned that Parliament itself will have an opportunity to scrutinise the process. I think that conflicts of interest have to be addressed at that particular stage, it has to be clear that whoever is appointed, whatever their interests might be&#151;whether they come from an employment or an educational background&#151;that those conflicts of interest are going to be managed. In public life, people do manage conflicts of interest in a very open way. The worst conflicts of interest are those that you do not know about. What we need is a very open process whereby everyone will understand the background of the person concerned. I think that that is a manageable process.</p>
<p>Secondly, when we come to consistency, the regulator will require awarding bodies that offer the same qualification to act in a consistent manner, particularly with regard to the setting of standards. We can do that through working with the awarding bodies&#151;it is important that we start with the premise that we do work with them because they have a lot of expertise, great professionalism and a commitment to ensuring that standards are maintained from year to year and are appropriate to the qualification concerned. It is appropriate that our starting point will always be working with the awarding bodies to ensure that we have an agreement about how we are going to address issues where inconsistent behaviour could lead to different standards. If we cannot achieve that through consensus, then the Bill gives us the power of direction and that is what we would have to rely on.</p>
<p>I am sorry, I have forgotten your first point.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> Indeed it is. That is why I believe it is very important that the Bill not only gives us the independence and the autonomy, but that it is also seen to do so. Perception is a very important element of how &nbsp;people understand autonomy and independence. It is not just the words on the page, it is actually how it is all enacted.</p>
<p>Moving to appointments, the Secretary of State will approve appointments to the board. I do not think that it is explicit in the Bill, but it would certainly be my expectation that the Ofqual chair would be involved in that appointment process. It may be that there needs to be some thought given as to whether that should be explicit in the Bill, as I believe it is in the case of the UK Statistics Authority. There is also a little bit in the Bill about the Secretary of State approving the numbers of Ofqual staff, terms and conditions of service and so on. I understand that that is all part of the accountability of Ofqual on matters that have an effect on the spending of Ofqual. It may be that there are other ways of looking at that, rather than giving an impression that the Secretary of State is, as it were, in control of Ofqual. Of course, again, that would undermine the perception, even though the reality behind the perception might be somewhat different. There are ways in which the Committee&#146;s scrutiny of the Bill might address some of the concerns that you have expressed here, and might demonstrate more clearly that Ofqual is a body that is truly independent of Government.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> That is always the point, of course, at which the issue of standards comes very much to the fore, and setting a standard for a new qualification is a difficult challenge for all concerned. It is a challenge for the awarding bodies and it will be a challenge for the regulator. That is why it is so important that we have a means of talking with the awarding bodies at an early stage about how those standards should be set and how a continuity with previous standards must be established. The Bill gives Ofqual the authority to take the lead on that, and to ensure that we all have a clear understanding of how we will go about setting standards for any new qualifications that come along.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> There is one particularly important area that the Committee might find useful to explore during the Bill. That is the process by which qualifications are developed. To clarify, in the qualifications system, bodies like OCR, AQA and others develop qualifications. We write the syllabuses and, from the syllabuses, we write exams and other kinds of assessments. From those, we set standards and award qualifications. The regulator is established to oversee that and&#151;if I can use an aviation analogy&#151;make sure that those planes are fit to fly.</p>
<p>As in the aviation or food industry, the crucial job of a regulator is at the start of that process. It must make sure that only planes that are fit to fly are allowed to &nbsp;take to the air and only food that is fit to eat is put on supermarket shelves. That is important because it might be tempting to think that the regulator needs lots of powers only at the end of the process to beat up awarding bodies when the standards do not add up. However, most of the risk in the qualifications arena is when qualifications are created, and we would like to see Ofqual able to assert its independence powerfully at that point.</p>
<p>If one reads only the Ofqual chapter in the Bill, it would seem that that is the model we are moving towards. However, an alternative route through this process is suggested if one reads the Ofqual chapter and the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency together, along with the accompanying notes. That process would begin with Ministers, and pass through QCDA, which might be heavily involved in developing the criteria against which qualifications are licensed. Only then would Ofqual have the opportunity to either say yes or no, often&#151;presumably&#151;under some pressure to say yes. Ofqual&#146;s role is then simply reduced to monitoring the qualification as it rolls out and trying to deal with any difficult features of the qualifications as they unfold.</p>
<p>We think that it is worth exploring whether the intent that is clear in the Ofqual chapter of the Bill still stands up when the QCDA chapter, schedules and explanatory notes are stacked up; that suggests more of a subtle interplay between the bodies than we think the Secretary of State might want to achieve.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mike Creswell:</span> Greg is making a good point. It is critical that Ofqual is able to take a view about developments that come forward from QCDA in so far as those developments affect its capacity to regulate standards and liability and so on. This concerns the way Ofqual is able to take a view and for that view to stick when it comes to the finalisation of the criteria. I take some comfort from the fact that it is Ofqual that will own those criteria and, presumably, unless those criteria will enable it to regulate, then it will not accept them.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> I am happy to answer that in all seriousness. The first thing is to repeat what I said earlier: a regulator that finds itself counting crashed planes and fining people for crashing them is an unsuccessful regulator. The important thing is that effort, power, authority and resource within Ofqual must be devoted to getting qualifications that are fit for use into the system in the first place. That is an important principle. The second thing concerns OCR, as I mentioned earlier. It is a charity, a not-for-profit organisation embedded in a university, part of an international group that lives on &nbsp;its reputation. The currency of the business we are in, if you want to call it that, is reputation, integrity and trust. If you want to wound my organisation, you wound its reputation rather than its finances. Most of what is envisaged for Ofqual will be about a public debate. If at any stage Kathleen and her colleagues were to feel that OCR was not doing its job properly, the threat of being shamed is much stronger than the threat of being fined for an organisation like mine.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mike Creswell:</span> I would add that AQA is not-for-profit but we do a lot of examining in areas where we believe there is a social need because we are an educational charity. It would be passing strange to have to make provision, possibly at the expense of the examining that we do for its social and educational good, against the possibility of being fined. I would think it inappropriate, given the structure of the awarding bodies and the kind of social contract that exists about putting in effort and resources that are not profitable but are socially desirable.</p>

<p> Mike, in your note to the Committee you tell us about the much-publicised problems in summer 2008 when Ofqual asked your organisation to lower the standard it was setting in GCSE science to come into line with the other two bodies.

<p><span class="italic">Mike Creswell:</span> Yes, happily, without rehearsing the GCSE science thing, because in a way that is done and dusted. It absolutely highlights that I hear what Kathleen says when she talks about the power to direct to awarding bodies how they should go about setting standards. I am clear that in broad procedural terms, that power is there. Indeed, I am clear that in the science incident, all the awarding bodies had followed the procedure as laid down. However precise that procedure was made, I am sure that we would all follow it, but there is a distinction between following the process and what results come out of it.</p>
<p>What the GCSE science incident really highlighted was that however much Ofqual may be empowered to command a process, that does not guarantee results and standards that are consistent at the end of the process. That is what the science thing illustrated. That is why it is extremely important that when events like that arise&#151;though rare, they will arise again&#151;Ofqual has the authority in the room so that everybody understands that though everybody will have followed the process, if the outcomes are looking different, Ofqual has the power to compel a standard to change. There is a key distinction between Ofqual guaranteeing the actual standards set and Ofqual guaranteeing that the processes are all in tune. The same processes do not, as GCSE showed, necessarily produce identical standards.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mike Creswell:</span> I think that Ofqual should simply have a power to direct, for a particular qualification, a particular standard on a particular occasion. It would be used rarely, if ever, but it would prevent Ofqual, at a time when urgent action might be needed&#151;certainly for GCSEs and A-levels&#151;from finding itself in negotiation with awarding bodies about a change in the standards that they are proposing to set. It would ensure that Ofqual had the authority to do that. I have to say that that requires the clarity that I talked about earlier about precisely how we define consistent standards. That is why part of our submission to the Committee is about the need for Ofqual to establish clear and measurable criteria for assessing whether our standards are consistent.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> No. The Bill is very clear, actually, as I see it. Bearing in mind what I have already said about the importance of Ofqual applying maximum effort at the beginning of the process and making sure that qualifications are fit for purpose when launched, I think that there is then a sufficient backstop in the Bill in the form of a power to direct that is open-ended enough to be used in the way that Mike is talking about. However, I hope that the Committee recognises that it will always be a failure of regulation for awarding bodies and the regulator to find themselves in that situation.</p>

Then we will not be in the situation that Greg described. Those two things&#151;the power to direct on a specific standard consistently, and clarity about some of the key issues that underpin that unfortunate public debate every summer&#151;are what I hope Ofqual would have.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> Briefly, I want to make a connection with the earlier discussion about accountability to Parliament and what might be in an annual report from &nbsp;Ofqual. I imagine it would be specifically laid out in the Act that Ofqual reports those kinds of incidents and each and every occasion on which it directed an awarding body. That would mean that the direction is visible, and that it could be accompanied by a commentary on why a direction is necessary, given all the other powers that might have been used earlier in the process to avoid it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> It is good that the awarding bodies have said so clearly that Ofqual should have the powers. I totally agree with everything that was said on that, but I happen to believe that the Bill already gives us the powers, as I described earlier, on conditions and direction. That is clear. However, I reiterate what was said: there is no point coming to a regulator two weeks before the publication of results and saying, &#147;This is a problem that we have not been able to solve.&#148; For the record, Ofqual asked nobody to lower standards. There were three awarding bodies, each of which worked professionally to maintain standards. Two weeks before exam results, you are not in a position to perform an act of Solomon to prevent the baby being cut in half, as it were.</p>
<p>The only way in which you can regulate qualifications is to get it right at the beginning. You need to lay down the requirements very clearly. We are expecting every awarding body that is offering the same qualification to do so in order to maintain standards.</p>
<p>We have already started that process since the summer. We looked ahead and, given the limited powers that we have under the current legislation, we have been working with our colleagues to ensure that there is no wide discrepancy, as there was last summer, between the interpretation of the evidence that you need to set grade bandings that are consistent across the boards and over time. We have been looking at the AS units that have been awarded. We have a system in place, and we are monitoring it, and we do not anticipate the sort of problem that we had in the summer.</p>

<p> That is helpful. I have one final question, which follows up something that John Hayes said earlier. He was talking about circumstances where you have a big shift in the composition of a qualification, such as in the modular GCSEs. Is your job in holding standards level or consistent&#151;to end the summer debate&#151;such that you would expect a cohort with the same abilities that had previously gone through under the old qualification to get the same broad distribution of grades in the new examination, even if its composition, modules and coursework has changed? Is that a reasonable expectation of what keeping standards consistent means?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> Assuming that they are identical in a very large cohort, you would expect a broadly similar pattern, even if there are some shifts because of the nature of the curriculum change or the accessibility of the examination, modules or whatever. However, it is &nbsp;not so simple, in so far as you have three awarding bodies, each of which has its share of the market. You have got to be very clear when looking at the outcomes of the three awarding bodies that you are truly reflecting the nature of the entry to those exams, and the nature of the challenges that candidates have faced.</p>
<p>For me, there is a clear balance between the technical and statistical evidence of the nature of the cohort, which is clearly a major part of standard setting. However, bearing in mind that young people and old people are working very hard for their qualification and looking at the evidence that they produce&#151;their scripts and other things&#151;a balance of professional judgment and technical expertise must be struck, which all the awarding bodies recognise. The issue is how much value we place on those matters.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> We have advocated for a long time the need for a more visible and stronger regulator in that sector, hand on heart. I have said that the value of what we do rests so much on our public reputation, public trust and a sense of integrity in the system, but there is clearly a persistent challenge out there, partly about levels of political involvement, which I think is unjustified but understand where the perception comes from.</p>
<p>There is also a perception that change is too frequent, too ill-understood and that it too often puts standards at risk without us knowing the risk we are taking. I suffer the consequences of that gradual erosion of trust as much as anyone, not just in the summer, but in the perpetual and corrosive debate that runs in the media much of the time. I am looking forward to the day when there is an independent voice that will stand alongside me and, when I have got it right, will say so to build pubic confidence in what I do and that is willing, when I do not get it right, to take that into the public domain so that we can see it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> No, the thing I want to address is the public perception that we are somehow giving away a standard so that we can demonstrate in a way that gets public confidence that we are maintaining standards. I believe that we are maintaining standards and think that we go to extraordinary lengths to understand changes. For example, as the A-level is changing structure we are going to unprecedented lengths to understand the consequences of that change and some of the risk to which we and the people who take our qualifications might be exposed. That is why I want it there.</p>
<p>I will be honest and say that, with regard to vocational qualifications, which OCR is also involved in, I have concerns that varying degrees of rigour are applied to some qualifications by some bodies and think that it would be helpful to have a regulator who gave that more visibility. There are different sorts of risks. We have talked a lot about what might be thought of as higher profile qualifications, such as GCSEs and A-levels. In the area of vocational qualifications, where there are more different qualifications, where there often assessment arrangements that are dependent on a tutor in a college or a trainer in a training company making judgments about their own students, there are a range of additional challenges to making sure that those qualifications hold water. There is work to be done in that area, particularly with the current state of the economy and the drive to &nbsp;put the right skills back into the economy, some of those qualifications will become more important than ever. It has been an area that has been under-regulated to date. I should like to see a stronger regulator in that area.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mike Creswell:</span> I think the straight answer to your question is that, yes, there are unquestionably commercial issues in competition between awarding bodies. One of the things that I think a strong and independent regulator will provide is an answer to the accusation that standards are dumbed down for commercial reasons. That is one of the reasons why we welcome a regulator. The other reason is because in the end the system that we operate is only there to provide good, valuable qualifications for learners so that they can go on and progress and live happy and fulfilled lives. That will not happen without some very clear public accountability and some very clear public assurance that those qualifications are worth the paper they are printed on. For that reason, put together with the commercial competition point, it is an extremely good development to have an independent regulator for qualifications.</p>

<p> I want to pick up on some points that Kathleen made earlier. Ofqual is already in existence, albeit not in the same form as it will be in the future. I find it quite surprising that you had not already looked at some of the concerns that have been expressed by independent academics about the rigour of current examinations, for which the Government are responsible. Surely that should have been an enormous priority for your organisation? A number of people and organisations, whether it is Peter Timms, the Royal Society of Chemistry or the British Council, have put together independent and coherent arguments that there are problems there. When will you look at this and when will you give us some answers on the issues that are being raised? That is a really important role of the regulator. The other point that I wanted you to clarify is this. Accountability is critical in this area. To whom are you as an organisation accountable? To put it bluntly, who can sack you?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> We do listen, but there are several voices out there about standards. We must not react to one or other without the clear evidence of doing so. When you asked me about looking at grade inflation, I should have said that several studies that have been conducted over the years involving international experts looking at our system have concluded that there is grade inflation. We need to bring in that sort of expertise. We will do that. I am sorry if we appear to be slow off the mark, but there are some studies, such as the reliabilities study, which are well down the mark.</p>
<p>On the accountability issue, we are, as we established earlier, going to be accountable to Parliament. We will present the report to Parliament and it will make clear what work we have done, how we have gone about it, what criteria there are to judge whether we have been successful and whether we are doing the job that we were set up to do in a very rigorous way. I suppose that if it came to a sacking, that would be a loss of public confidence. I think that any chair who is in a position where there is a loss of public confidence really has to consider his or her position before it gets to the sacking point. But if it were to get the sacking point, the question is whether, as indicated here, it would be the Secretary of State for other points of reference, or whether Parliament itself would deal with the matter. I would think that you would want to include that in the Bill. However, sacking ought not to be necessary. If the chief regulator&#151;that is the title that the post carries&#151;has lost the confidence of the public and of Parliament, that should lead the individual to question their position.</p>

<p> I am pleased to be able to ask these witnesses one question&#151;there are so many. I would like to pick up on fining, because that is where the Secretary &nbsp;of State says that he has an open mind. I listened to the responses from the two charity people, but not all awarding bodies are charities, particularly now that we have the likes of McDonalds, Flybe and so on as awarding bodies. You spoke about the importance of regulating vocational bodies. Do you think that in the context of commercial organisations as awarding bodies, there may be some merit in giving Kathleen what she wants&#151;the ability to fine?</p>

<p><span class="italic">Mike Creswell:</span> My concern is with general qualifications, the qualifications that the great majority of our 16 and 18-year-olds do. In that setting, I think that the point I made earlier trumps the need to control other people in other parts of the sector.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Greg Watson:</span> I would go back to my principle that the greatest damage can be done to any qualification is to undermine public confidence in it, and that is as true for a commercial organisation trying to market a qualification to earn revenues as it is for my organisation, which uses a qualification to enhance its reputation. The damage that Ofqual can do, if that is what it seeks to do through powers of intervention, in saying that a qualification is not fit for purpose, that it will be de-listed or that it has a big black mark hanging over it until somebody answers some serious questions, would have exactly the effect that you are looking for even on a commercial organisation. By doing it in that way, you risk all the wrong effects on charitable organisations that Mike alluded to earlier.</p>

<p> Kathleen, I might as well give you the final run at this.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Kathleen Tattershall:</span> I hear what my colleagues say, but I think that having fines in the armoury of the regulator is an important safeguard. Down the line, one may wish they had that power, instead of going from a fairly moderate sanction of direction and possibly capping fees or whatever, and leaping to taking away the accreditation of an awarding body, which is the ultimate sanction.</p>
<p>The power to fine is, in a sense, a safeguard. It gives the regulator the possibility to do so and could be a deterrent. I totally agree with what has been said: at the end of the day, the awarding bodies&#146; reputations are on the line if they are criticised by the regulator. Nevertheless, it is something that ought to be in our range of sanctions&#151;whether it is used often or not.</p>
<p>Chair, I wonder if I could take the opportunity to come back on the question that Annette asked?</p>
