<p> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary announcements. Hon. Members may take off their jackets during Committee meetings, if they wish to do so. Hon. Members should please ensure that all electronic devices are switched off throughout our proceedings. There is a money resolution and a Ways and Means resolution in connection with the Bill, and both are available in the Room.</p>
<p>First, the Committee will consider the programme motion on the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence, and then to a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence sessions. Assuming that the second motion is agreed, the Committee will move into private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral evidence session will commence.</p>
<p>I am afraid that members of the public who are present will be disrupted at the beginning, but I hope that it will not be too long before they can come back in and hear the oral evidence session. We will hear oral evidence this morning and this afternoon. On Thursday we will proceed to clause by clause scrutiny of the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-07-17_CHILDMAIN_01-0_2007-07-17a.1.18" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" time="10:47" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/childmain/070717/am/70717s01.htm#07071814000021" colnum="3">
<p> I start by asking the Ministers why we do not have draft regulations, unlike the Welfare Reform Bill? We have a Prime Minister committed to a new environment of open parliamentary scrutiny, but we are considering the broad architecture with very few details laid out.</p>
<p>Given the previous difficulties that the CSA has had&mdash;hon. Members on both sides of the House are extremely worried about this&mdash;why was the Bill not brought forward at the same time as the regulations so that we could have scrutiny leading to possible amendment? That will not be possible when the draft regulations come in. When the regulations come in by statutory instrument, they can be only accepted or rejected.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-07-17_CHILDMAIN_01-0_2007-07-17a.1.19" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" speakername="James Plaskitt" time="10:47" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/childmain/070717/am/70717s01.htm#07071814000023" colnum="3">
<p> May I try to help in answering that? It is sensible to approach the regulations in different categories. First, much of the Bill is framework architecture for work that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission will do subsequently. It is important to stress that we are moving from an agency model to a commission model. It is right, in many respects, to allow the commission to devise its own systems. Therefore, it is right and proper that the commission be established first and then for it to think how it wants to proceed in respect of various areas&mdash;some of those things will eventually emerge via regulation. Logically, the regulations will not come forward until the commission has done that work. Examples of operational regulations that need to await Royal Assent and the establishment of the commission are those that relate to fees, maintenance assessments, and the transfer of cases.</p>
<p>However, I may help the Committee by pointing out that other regulations will relate more to the setting up of the new system, and they will come forward sooner. For example, regulations relating to CMEC as a legal entity, the extension of the &#163;10 disregard to old cases, the repeal of section 6 of the 1991 Act&mdash;that is the compulsory engagement of benefit recipients into the system&mdash;and the new enforcement powers will come forward earlier. We suspect that that will take place in the spring of 2008.</p>
<p>There is a third category where we hope to bring forward draft regulations during the procedure of line-by-line scrutiny in Committee. For example, those draft regulations that can be proceeded with in a timely fashion relate to clauses 29 to 31, which cover debt management, clause 34, which covers the recovery of arrears from estates, and clause 35, which deals with the disclosure of information to credit reference agencies. I expect draft regulations on those clauses to come before the Committee. In respect of those for which we cannot put draft regulations before the Committee, we will produce a dossier for it to consider, which will provide an explanation about regulations that are still forthcoming.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-07-17_CHILDMAIN_01-0_2007-07-17a.1.21" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" time="10:47" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/childmain/070717/am/70717s01.htm#07071814000026" colnum="4">
<p> I have a brief supplementary question. Why is CMEC being set up as a non-departmental public body rather than an executive Government agency? Surely the past 10 years tell us that parliamentary scrutiny will become much more important. Many people have put it to me that only an MP&rsquo;s letter has made the CSA jump to try to sort out often intractable cases. As a non-departmental public body, it will be much more at arm&rsquo;s length, and a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House are concerned about our ability to scrutinise, to hold Ministers to account and to get answers from CMEC.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> Perhaps I may answer that question. It is very important that the body is more at arm&rsquo;s length, and that we do, indeed, have a clear break from the current situation. A key part of Sir David Henshaw&rsquo;s analysis is that we need to change operational matters as well as the policy framework. Having a non-departmental public body with separate governance arrangements and with greater operational flexibility is a key part of the reforms.

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> It is more difficult. A key part of the non-departmental public body is that it is has a non-executive board to lead the strategy and focus of the operation. That is much more difficult to do under an agency arrangement. There will be operational flexibility, which will allow the commissioning of the range of services that CMEC needs. Parliamentary scrutiny is still available. The NDPB will have to report on an annual basis, and the report will deal not only with its accounts, but with the extent to which it has contracted out its services. There will still be accountability through Ministers. There are processes for the new commission to be held fully to account through Select Committees and other routes. I do not believe that the engagement of MPs in that process will &nbsp;change substantially. We want to ensure that those links are strong and enshrined in the new arrangements, particularly with regard to the ability to follow up individual casework.</p>

<p> When the Minister was talking about regulations, he did not mention minutes of agreement. They have been welcomed throughout the House, but there is a painful lack of detail about how they will work.

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> The issue of whether there should be a register of agreements is something that we want the commission to determine in due course. It might wish to arrange pilots to enable it to make that decision. There are arguments both ways about a register of voluntary agreements, and there are practical issues concerning the extent to which it could be kept up to date and the resources that the commission would have to deploy in keeping it current. I think that minutes of agreement are the Scottish equivalent of consent orders, and they will proceed on their current basis. The one key change will be that, once the section 6 compulsion goes, a claim for benefits by one or other of the participants will not break the agreement. It will continue, subject to the 12-month rule, under which either party can elect to come out of the agreement.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> The information and support service will be an important component. It is important that that is up and running robustly by the time the section 6 compulsion goes. As you would expect, the role of that service is to encourage and help to facilitate voluntary agreements, as well as to help people access the statutory service. That will be in place at an early stage, by the time the section 6 compulsion goes. That resource will be there to help and guide people. The full range of information and support that will be given has not yet been fully worked out, but we would expect a standard maintenance agreement to be on offer, which people can use to put in place voluntary arrangements. That support will be there.</p>

<p> I have two questions, although the first is perhaps more of an observation. It is interesting that another Department has recently introduced lasting powers of attorney, which are registerable before operation. Given that there is bound to be an interaction with the total income levels of participants in the process, it might be relevant to consider that.</p>
<p>My question relates to the assurances about accountability that the Minister has given us. I understand his arguments, particularly for operational flexibility and even for a degree of discretion. Against that, one has to weigh the need to ensure that what is prescribed in the law is carried out, that practice is consistent between different cases and that discretion is effected in a reasonably principled way. Will the Minister assure us, first, that if we have individual casework, in practical terms we will be able to pursue the matter in almost exactly the same way and, secondly, that if we have what might be termed systemic concerns about the way in which CMEC is to operate, we can at least raise them rather than waiting for the off-chance of an annual report debate in Westminster Hall or elsewhere?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> Yes, I believe that I can give an assurance on each of those points.

<p>So far as concerns with systemic problems that are perceived as CMEC gets up and running, there are clearly a variety of routes to raise&mdash;for instance, through the Secretary of State and the Minister with that particular responsibility. It will bubble up to the surface in a variety of ways, and it will be clear to all and subject to appropriate challenge and scrutiny in Parliament. Do you want to say anything, Stephen?</p>

They will have the possibility of experiencing the information support service in 2008, subject to the passage of the Bill. Thereafter, those who wish to move to a voluntary arrangement or to the new statutory scheme set out in the Bill will start receiving communications about their options and the support mechanisms.</p>
<p>That will happen between 2008 and 2010, when, as set out in the White Paper, we expect the commission to be ready to move people to where they want to go.

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> I believe that it does. It is an important point. It is not only a change of structure and governance arrangements; the remit of the commission is to maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements, be they voluntary or made through the statutory service. That broad remit to maximise maintenance arrangements is given for reasons that I am sure will be familiar&mdash;tackling child poverty and getting more money to more children. It will also have a remit to promote child maintenance and to create an awareness among the public about the importance of such matters. That will be a key part of its remit.</p>
<p>It is right that these things should be bundled together, along with the new assessment and the change in relation to the disregard, into a new entity, in order to establish a break with the past. Despite the hard work of lots of people, there is no doubt that although the CSA is improving under the operational improvement plan it is not delivering what we would expect of it. That legacy is going to be very difficult to shake off, but it is important that we do it. Breaking the culture of non-compliance is certainly important, and I think that a new commission with new enforcement powers will be a key part of that.</p>

<p> CMEC is going to be responsible for information and guidance, collection and enforcement and, although this is not spelt out, for the assessment of maintenance too. That does not sound so very different from the CSA in its present form. A potential issue arises here. As Mr. Selous pointed out, this is a non-governmental body rather than an Executive agency. At least there is a degree of clarity at the moment. When the CSA makes a mistake, or is held to make a mistake, which has filled several filing cabinets in my office over the years, we have recourse to the appeals tribunal and the social security commissioner and it is fairly clear. This would be the first example that I know of&mdash;there may be others&mdash;of a non-governmental body being open to the workings of the appeals tribunal and the social security commissioner.

<p><span class="italic">  Mr. Plaskitt:  </span> Obviously this is an important new part of the scheme and it is another part of the clean break from what has gone before. One of the drivers here is to try to encourage separating couples to come to their own voluntary arrangements wherever possible. After all, such arrangements have a higher chance of sticking than ones that are forced through a system. As part and parcel of moving to a system that facilitates more voluntary arrangements, it is right and proper to offer advice and support services to help couples to come to the right decisions about what arrangements they are going to make for child maintenance.</p>
<p>It is up to CMEC to develop those services and there will be a key role for third and voluntary sectors in providing those services. After all, it will be very close to many types of advice and support that those organisations are giving already. It will be a natural fit in that sense. We must also think about where parents will turn to instinctively when they are unfortunately embarking on a separation. This advice and support service needs to be parked in exactly the places that they will turn to so that they do not have to think about where to find it. It needs to be there at the point to which they instinctively turn.</p>
<p>That is how we see these services evolving. They will have many dimensions to them. Potentially there will be face-to-face advice for couples who are finding it a struggle to reach a voluntary arrangement. Behind that there will be more passive advice in the form of a website and a contact centre which parents can call to get over-the-phone advice about setting up their own voluntary arrangements. It will be multidimensional, but largely for the commission to determine in the end how it will operate.</p>

<p>On the issue of the service, I may not have focused on it as much as others might have done, but I take it from what has been said that there is no question of there being, for example, a local tendering whereby a non-governmental organisation might take over offering the service locally rather than simply having an impersonal helpline.

<p> I am interested in what you say about how this is going to be a clean &nbsp;break. One of the current issues with the Child Support Agency is the fact that when people use the phone, they are dealing with umpteen different people. They never actually get a case officer who is dealing with their particular case. What steps are you going to take to ensure that there is some consistency and that people have somebody who is directly responsible for dealing with their particular case?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Geraghty:  </span> The CSA is currently moving to having groups of people, not always individuals, dealing with particular cases. To do that, we need to make changes to the computer system, which we will have done by the end of the year. Particularly complex cases, complaint cases and cases where we take legal action already have an individual owner.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, we will have groups of about 20 to 30 people who have a case holding between them. Having an individual case officer for every case does not work because our people work, on average, only about a third of the time that the CSA is open. A person could not ring the agency and expect to speak to the same person; we are open 68 hours a week, but our people do not work all of those hours. Therefore, some sort of group arrangement is needed.</p>
<p>I envisage that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission would build on that start and be able to take forward, wherever possible, individual case responsibility, which is very popular with clients. Indeed, those who work in the CSA would prefer to be able to see the good that they do in the cases that they handle.</p>

<p> I understand the point that you are making about the outreach and support services, but experience shows that, in such circumstances, case workers tend to read out a tick list.

We are asking the voluntary and third sectors what sort of scope and specialisms they might have, so that the information service is designed from the client&rsquo;s point of view, not from what we believe might be true. It is clear already that the survey data varies according to whether the separated parent is a parent with care or a non-resident parent.

Before it is introduced, the Secretary of State will lay regulations and do so on the advice of the commission.

Whatever those arrangements are, they must not force people&mdash;particularly low-income families&mdash;out of the system and prevent them from entering into proper and effective maintenance agreements.

<p> It comes back to the intention and purpose of charging. If the fairly considerable cost of operating the CSA is a measure of the costs that will be involved in running CMEC, and if you were seeking to recover some of those administrative costs, the implication is that charges would be pretty high.

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Geraghty:  </span> The power exists for the current agency to contract out pretty much anything. That is a relatively recent power. We have contracted out things for which we do not have capacity, when the problem was the overall capacity of the agency generally. However, specialist trace-work for finding some non-resident parents has been contracted out to people who are better equipped. Looking around the world, 2 or 3 per cent. of the enforcement is contracted out in the USA. Some counties in Virginia and some judicial districts in Tennessee have contracted out completely, and their performance is similar to those that are still run in-house, which is why it has not taken off as a broader movement in America. It is something that the commission would consider, but only if it was likely to be effective in the individual circumstances, given the commission&rsquo;s capacity and how efficiently each part was running.</p>

<p> I want to ask about the scope of CMEC. This is perhaps an opportunity to set a slightly different direction in terms of the objectives of what we do. Mr. Geraghty talked about one or two things that happen in America, for example. If you look at the Australian Child Support Agency, one thing that it is much better at, and which frankly the CSA has never done here, is trying to deal with the human side of break-up and to ensure that the ongoing emotional support, as well as the financial support, for children carries on from both parents going forward.</p>
<p>I had a look at the Australian CSA&rsquo;s website yesterday evening, and on the front page it says &ldquo;Support for Separated Parents&rdquo;. You can download these excellent documents. I do not know if you have seen them. One is &ldquo;Me and my kids: parenting from a distance&rdquo;; the other is &ldquo;Me, my kids and my ex&rdquo;. They are full of incredibly practical help, information and support to try to make life better for children. That is what we are talking about: the money plus a better situation in terms of parental involvement, where it is safe, from both parents going forward.</p>
<p>The CSA has never really done the human side of what we are talking about. My contention&mdash;my argument to you&mdash;is that if you get the human side &nbsp;right, by which I mean the emotional support, that could not be a better aid in helping us all achieve what we are seeking, which is a regular, reliable supply of financial information.</p>
<p>This is a new opportunity. The Bill is before us, and I am really asking you to look very carefully at what the Australian CSA did. It may be that you do not want to provide it as CMEC because of some of the past history, but in terms of the purchaser-provider split, are you going to ensure that some of this help and support is provided, which other CSAs around the world in societies pretty similar to our own are providing? I urge you most strongly to look at that as a way of helping us to achieve what we are all trying to achieve.</p>

The Australians have very clearly come to the conclusion that it is about supporting the family, and we are making a move in the same direction, through information and support. The sort of questions that we had on charging, and where that goes, will also reflect an attitude of where we place ourselves on that spectrum.</p>

Again, the point you make about arrangements that are entered into voluntarily and consensually rather than fought out acrimoniously is absolutely right. Any support that can be given to move in that direction has to be right. We see the information and support service initially as perhaps signposting other available services. This is a step along the way to building a more holistic service.</p>

I spent some time there in a family relationship centre to &nbsp;learn how it set it up, what difficulties it had, how many people it helps, at what cost and to what sustained outcomes. The more we can learn, the more likely we are to set up something here with CMEC that works for the children.</p>

<p> May I take it from Lord McKenzie&rsquo;s answer that there is at least a commitment to signpost where this type of support and help can be found for separated parents?

<p> I want to ask a couple of questions about the transfer of staff in a moment. First, may I just comment on some exchanges earlier with Mr. Weir about information and point to one of the underlying concerns? I assume CMEC will have the information, but I hope it will not abuse it by allowing it to leak out further. We know how sensitive the Revenue is on this and, indeed, how sensitive our constituents are.</p>
<p>My questions relate to the new structure of employees when the commission comes into force. Could you give us an idea of the percentage of current CSA staff who will be required by CMEC and the fate, if I may put it that way, of the transfer? There will be some who will come across, and I take it that they will be covered by Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 in relation to their entitlements. Some may be made redundant and, equally, there will be some new recruits who may have different and more appropriate skills for the mix. Could you comment on that general picture? Can I also ask you about training for the new commission? It seems that not enough was initially invested in the CSA. There are still difficulties with people understanding what are very complicated formulae. That all feeds into morale and the likely attitude of staff to the new organisation.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> Under the Bill, at the point that functions transfer from the CSA to CMEC, there will be a TUPE transfer of all staff. There is provision for the Secretary of State to carve out some people who will not, which is envisaged to be some contractors who may be working at that stage. So everybody moves in at that stage with the opportunity of remaining in the civil service pension scheme, too, and with the prospect of vacancies arising in the Department being available to them as if they had not transferred. Those are quite important protections.</p>
<p>In relation to head count, Stephen may wish to comment in more detail. Obviously, as we are expecting a lower level of use of the commission than is currently part of the CSA&rsquo;s casework, and with improvements to IT systems, fewer staff will be required eventually than will be needed at the start of the process.</p>
<p>You asked about training. Clearly, with potentially new or enhanced bases of assessment and new responsibilities relating to ensuring effective maintenance arrangements generally, training for staff will need to &nbsp;be properly provided for. Stephen or Hilary might be able to comment on the extent to which we are developing that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Mr. Plaskitt:  </span> Before Stephen comes in, I should like to pick up on your comment about morale, because it is an important matter. Bill and I, along with other Ministers in the Department for Work and Pensions, have done a series of visits to the large CSA offices around the country, to discuss the reform process with staff. On those visits, we have always found that staff morale in the agency in surprisingly high. I say surprisingly because of all the criticism they receive, most of which is inappropriately directed. We have all tried to stress that issues of systemic failure in the agency are not the fault of its staff, because they have to work with a broken system. The reason for such high morale is the interest in this reform and the belief that it is what is needed for the staff to be part of a successful child maintenance operation. We find a lot of good will and commitment to making it work. That is worth stressing.</p>

<p> I should like to ask two questions. First, if a significant reduction in numbers is required, how do you propose to handle that? Secondly, to what time scale are we working for both the transfer of staff and the training programmes?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-07-17_CHILDMAIN_01-0_2007-07-17a.1.143" nospeaker="true" time="10:47" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/childmain/070717/am/70717s01.htm#07071821000096" colnum="17">
<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> I reinforce what James has said about morale. People in the agency generally are a little bit worried about the future, because it looks uncertain. We have just done a survey, which we do regularly, and apart from that uncertainty, people think that we are going in the right direction. We now help 130,000 more children every month than we did two years ago. People are pleased that we are putting more emphasis on enforcement, taking more action, clearing the unassessed cases and so on. They feel progress. I agree with James that morale is surprisingly but consistently high. The staff tend to be slightly angry that they are held responsible for the lack of tools that they have had, but they are not depressed by it, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>I shall now come on to the numbers. We plan to transfer everybody under TUPE-like terms in July, or shortly after the Royal Assent once CMEC is established as a body corporate. By then, we will have reduced the number of people that we have, because under the Department&rsquo;s Gershon efficiency target, we have to manage a 15 per cent. reduction by the end of this business year. We are dealing with that largely through natural wastage, supported by some voluntary redundancy programmes, which we will announce shortly. We do not envisage having to make any compulsory redundancies.</p>
<p>As we move into the early years of the commission, we will have the same case load and the same rules for a period. The number of people that we will need will be broadly similar, with perhaps some more to start off and manage the information and support service and to do some of the planning work. Around 2010, we will enter a new phase, in which we start to transition cases. For a while, each case will become two cases, if you like. The existing case will need to be moved to a new &nbsp;assessment, but we will still have debts to manage from the old scheme. During the transition period between 2010 and 2012-13, which is outlined in the papers, we will require similar numbers of people, although we should have made efficiency gains in the interim on the assessment and on the computer system.</p>
<p>When we have largely sorted out the legacy of the past&mdash;our debt problems&mdash;and we have everyone on the new assessment, we envisage two results. First, we will have a much simpler assessment process. At the moment, about a third of our caseworking resources go into calculating and recalculating the assessment, which we change as people&rsquo;s net weekly income changes. We will be able to go to one source for most of our assessments and the assessments will last longer, so we should need fewer people for those reasons.</p>
<p>Secondly, because we are making the system voluntary, rather than compulsory, it will not be awash with benefit claimants. At the moment, 250,00 benefit claimants are referred to us each year, of whom only a third become a case. We put work into the rest, which does not benefit anybody in the long term because they have either gone off benefit by the time we get to an assessment, or they made a private arrangement before they came in and are resistant to moving it. For those two reasons, we envisage having fewer people in the longer term,</p>
<p>For those two reasons, we envisage having fewer people in the longer term, and we are talking about some two thirds of the current numbers. Clearly, that is sensitive to how many people use the service and how effective the new enforcement powers are at achieving the outcomes without having to put in more activity&mdash;that is, that the powers provide sufficient incentive.</p>
<p>I envisage, given the length of time, that it would be possible to achieve that through similar methods to those that we are using this year&mdash;natural wastage and some voluntary redundancy. However, we are talking about a long time in the future, and, again, it would be for the commission rather than for us to make any firm statements.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2007-07-17_CHILDMAIN_01-0_2007-07-17a.1.145" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" time="10:47" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmpublic/childmain/070717/am/70717s01.htm#07071821000103" colnum="18">
<p> Sir David Henshaw envisaged that the new system would be significantly different, and that the Government service would deal with a smaller set of more difficult cases. The regulatory impact assessment&rsquo;s analysis estimates that the number of parents with care would fall from the 1.4 million that use the CSA to about 1 million. One could view that as a significant reduction, but equally one could say that 1 million people were still using the state system. I am not sure that I would say that that was a significant change.</p>
<p>The other question&mdash;recognising what Stephen Geraghty just said&mdash;relates to the analysis that has been undertaken to get to those numbers. Of the current caseload of 1.5 million cases, 500,000 of those have nil liability. It could be argued that removing those cases with no liability would save some bureaucracy but not really change the amount of money that ends up with families and children. I am trying to understand what assessment you have made of the robustness of the figures, and the extent to which we are moving to a completely different system rather than moving to Child Support Agency version 3.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Geraghty:  </span> The people who were assessed at nil under the current systems are largely on the original 1993 scheme, under which the threshold at which maintenance was paid was higher. When the assessments were done under that scheme, slightly more than half of the people concerned had a nil assessment, but under the new scheme about 10 per cent. do. Were those 500,000 million people to move on to the new assessment, a lot of them would get money&mdash;probably close to 90 per cent. of them would have a positive assessment. It is probably not safe to think that those people would be the ones to move away from the scheme.</p>
<p>Of the current book of assessed cases, about half are private&mdash;they are not on benefit and are therefore with the scheme voluntarily. The working assumption is that they will remain with the scheme because they have made a choice and not sought private arrangements, and a similar proportion of the available market&mdash;that is the people on benefit&mdash;having free choice, will now choose to be with the scheme. That is where the figure of 1 million comes from. Although it would have worked mathematically as Mr. Harper deduced, that is not the basis of the calculation.</p>
<p>How robust is the calculation? That will depend on the reputation of the agency, how successful it is seen to be and whether people make the choice to join. It will also depend on how successful the information support service is in encouraging people, perhaps including some of the current clientele, to make private arrangements. Some research is under way to predict the likely outcome, and I hope that Hilary Reynolds will be able to provide some detail on that.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Hilary Reynolds:  </span> We have done the first extensive survey of separated parents this spring, we will start to receive the emerging results in the back end of this year and we will publish them probably very early next year. I say &ldquo;separated parents&rdquo;, because the matter involves not only CSA clients, but others. We are starting to ask how people would prefer to be treated, because the big unknown is what clients and parents will do when they have choice. We have tried to conduct telephone surveys and family research to get our first estimates, refining that through the responses to a fairly large client survey. So far, research suggests that about one quarter of parents with care would prefer to make private arrangements than use a statutory scheme, whereas some 50 per cent. of non-resident parents would prefer to make private arrangements than use a statutory scheme.</p>
<p>We are already starting to get information that enables us to start making an estimate of what might happen, given the demographics and how many people enter separation each year. We are having to do an evolving piece of research.</p>

<p> Those choices will depend, to some extent, on the parameters that the Government and the commission set. They will depend on charging, on the effectiveness of the body and on the equality and scope of the information. Although you say that you want it to be a choice, those choices will be guided by policy decisions. Picking up the point made by Dr. Turner, I did not know whether a view would be taken about the fees, for example. The level of the fees, for the non-resident parent and the parent with care, will drive decisions to some extent and the Government will have to have a view about the decisions they want people to make when those fees are set.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> The level has not been determined yet, as the Secretary of State said on Second Reading. There will have to be negotiations with the Treasury before it is finally determined. Initially, we have done some desk-top research on the impact of various levels of disregard&mdash;not only for child maintenance, but for housing benefit and council tax&mdash;on work disincentives as well as on the impact on child poverty. Further work has been commissioned and is under way at the moment. That will help to inform us as to where we want to end up on this matter.</p>

<p> One of the main aims of the Bill is to alleviate child poverty, and the regulatory impact assessment states that a significantly higher disregard would lift approximately an additional 100,000 children out of poverty. I am finding it difficult that you do not have the figures, but how did you come to that conclusion?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> The 100,000 figure is related to more than changes in the disregard. We think that an additional 80,000 children could be lifted out of poverty by having more maintenance arrangements generally, extending the &#163;10 disregard, having more effective enforcement and increasing the flat rate from &#163;5 to &#163;7. We believe that that collection of measures will have a significant impact.</p>
<p>With regard to the impact on child poverty at various levels of disregard, we have answered a number of parliamentary questions and looked at a range of levels. In deriving the 100,000 figure, we have assumed something towards the lower end of that scale, but on a prudent basis.</p>

<p> One of the main problems that the agency faces is the inaccuracy of the assessments, which leads to massive problems for your staff; they tear their hair out, as do parents with care and, no doubt, the non-resident parents, too. Obviously the move to use Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs data is widely welcomed across the House. Frankly, we should have done that years ago, so it is excellent that it is coming in. Why can we not have that from day one, and why can we not move to using HMRC data as soon as possible?

<p> I do not follow that. The provision of income from Revenue and Customs could presumably be provided today. HMRC must have those data, although perhaps they are stored in several places.

At the moment, we inquire of the Revenue about income levels when we cannot get the information elsewhere&mdash;about 80,000 inquiries were made last year, and HMRC is now our third source of information. Having failed to get an answer from the NRP and the employer, we now go to the Revenue.</p>

<p> The whole assessment formula is based on gross weekly income, which is fine for many; but some people&rsquo;s incomes vary an awful lot from week to week, especially manual workers on variable rates of overtime and so on. Indeed, many of my constituents in the acting profession go from feast to famine. Against that background, I wonder how you came to select the figure of 25 per cent. to cope with income variation and how you intend to apply it in practice.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> For those whose income varies within the year, we will get annual data. Whatever calculation runs from that, I suppose that individuals will be faced with the same issues that they would have in relation to budgeting generally for household expenses. Those who have no income one week but do the next will, in a sense, have to plan and budget for that.</p>
<p>As for the figure of 25 per cent., we have tried to pitch it that so that significant changes in circumstances can be adjusted in-year, and certainly if someone went from &nbsp;being in work to claiming benefit, or if there were other changes in circumstance, it would derive a change in the calculation. It is trying to set it at a level that will prevent an endless flow of changes of circumstance that gummed up the works in the past. We believe that a 25 per cent. threshold still leaves scope to adjust for significant changes in circumstances, but screens out more modest changes and therefore makes the process more efficient. Using HMRC gross data means that calculations can be updated, in a sense for the first time, on an annual basis. One of the bugbears of the current system is that data, once in, are used endlessly and sometimes never updated. The information will be more current and, therefore, if there has been a dip or an increase in income, it will feed through into a subsequent period&rsquo;s calculation.</p>

<p> One of the problems that MPs often get at present is with self-employed people. There seems to be a huge difference between what their alleged income is, as given to the CSA, and the lifestyle that the parent with care will say they are enjoying. Do you believe that the provisions in the Bill sufficiently address these issues, particularly with reference to self-employed people?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> We propose that, as for employed people, the assessment for self-employed people will be based on tax data. I suppose that if someone is cheating on their partner they will cheat on HMRC as well. Therefore, we will look to the safeguards in the tax system to support the basis that we use. There will still be a variations arrangement, under which someone who believes that the income reported for the non-resident parent does not properly reflect their lifestyle can seek an adjustment.</p>
<p>One of the things that we are working on is to see whether that variation process can be made more accessible. In the past, it has operated on quite a restrictive basis. We are trying to open that up a bit. Basing these calculations on tax data is a pretty solid footing. What we have also done, and we did this quite recently, was to adjust the result of the Smith case and we fed back capital allowances into the system. That was the right thing to do.</p>

<p> From what you are saying, it does not seem that there will be a great departure from the present system, under which you can already go to the CSA and say, &ldquo;I do not think this income is correct.&rdquo; My experience, 99 times out of 100, is that the CSA does not look at it properly, it takes for ever or it tries to get information from the other parent, which never comes. It just goes on and on and on. Even getting HMRC data, I do not see a great difference in this. It still seems that there will be a problem with self-employed people.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> It is that variations process which we are looking to revamp, to see whether we can ensure that it leads to changes, where they are appropriate, and is not as restrictive as it is at the moment. There is still work going on on that.</p>
<p>I would hang on to the point that using tax data is as solid a foundation as we can have. If we did not use that, what would we use? CMEC would have to make its calculation of what somebody&rsquo;s earnings are, what data it should use and whether they are any different from those supplied by HMRC, which I doubt. We would complicate the system. A key thrust of the changes is to simplify it and make it more effective.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Mr. Plaskitt:  </span> I think that you might also bear in mind some of the new enforcement powers that we are planning to take as a result of the Bill. There are some measures in it that will cause self-employed, non-resident parents to think much harder before considering not complying with their obligations. For example, there are the current account deduction orders and the referral of information to credit reference agencies, which can have quite a tough effect on someone who is self-employed and depends on credit lines. Put those alongside what we are saying about having more robust sources of information about income to start with, and add that to the tougher enforcement powers, and I think that the regime for self-employed NRPs will be much more robust than at present.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Geraghty:  </span> I think that from the agency perspective, your point is absolutely right. When we get a challenge from the parent with care, who says, &ldquo;Well, he earns more than that really&rdquo;, we go to the Revenue and get an assessment. If that is consistent, that is as far as we can go. If somebody has evidence, rather than saying, &ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; we can take it further. Of course, the parent with care can appeal against the assessment, but you are absolutely right in saying that, if the assessment basis is the tax details, which are what we currently go to as an arbitrator between the two views, we are in a similar position and the onus will still be on the parent with care to provide proof, if he or she has any. I agree with Lord McKenzie that for the agency now or CMEC in the future to set up a rival income-assessing machine to the Revenue and Customs would not be a good use of taxpayers&rsquo; money or the right thing to do. Whether the Revenue should use it more as an investigation trigger is something that we could discuss with it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> The answer to that is that we believe we have, but the measure of the task is reflected in the fact that we are looking to make that transition over a three-year period. Some have said that we should seek to do it earlier but, as Hilary said, we have learned some lessons from the past. The journey for somebody on the original system will be that when section 6 goes, they will have a choice whether to stay in, but there will not be an opportunity to transfer to the current system. There will be an opportunity to transfer to the new system during the process of transferring cases between 2010 and 2013. By March 2013, we will have one system, one basis of assessment and one client case load on that system. If they wish to stay in the system in the interim, it will be on the old basis.</p>

<p> On the enforceability of private voluntary agreements, the move to CMEC is, as I understand it, predicated on a reduction in the number of people coming to the organisation, because you hope that they will form their own voluntary agreements. There is general support for that, but is it not the case that people will form voluntary agreements only when they think that they are worth the paper they are written on in terms of being enforceable? Would you, as CMEC, not be helping yourselves if people were able to call on the enforcement powers of CMEC to ensure that an appropriate voluntary agreement was enforced? This seems to be a key issue. We touched on it earlier with the Scottish minutes of agreement issue, but it is much bigger than that and is definitely a UK-wide issue.</p>
<p>I get the sense from the Department&mdash;from what the Secretary of State said on Second Reading&mdash;that you do not want to have anything to do with enforcing private agreements. You see that as more work, and you are trying to shed work. I make the counter-claim that CMEC&rsquo;s having some role in ensuring that appropriate voluntary agreements are enforced would help to achieve your objectives. What do you say to that?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> We are not planning for CMEC to be involved in enforcing private agreements. The protection for people who enter private voluntary agreements is that if they break down, they have access to CMEC, or currently the CSA. That is the safety net. Going down the path of CMEC enforcing the range of different agreements that people will enter into to suit their circumstances, which may be formalised in a range of different ways, would be an administrative nightmare at the least.</p>
<p>We are trying to achieve circumstances in which two parties who have had a breakdown in their relationship can try to enter into agreements voluntarily. If the starting point is, &ldquo;If this doesn&rsquo;t work, we want to sue,&rdquo; it will peel away the ethos of what we are trying to create. We are right not to seek to enforce private agreements.</p>

<p> To pick up on the point about voluntary agreements, you have made it clear that you do not see a role for their enforcement, so what about monitoring and recording their existence, given that the Bill&rsquo;s objective is to maximise maintenance arrangements for the whole marketplace?

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> There has been a debate about whether there should be a register of voluntary or private agreements, and there are arguments on both sides. We want CMEC to take a view on it in due course, and it may wish to test it out at some stage. However, it is not necessarily very easy, because there will be a range of different voluntary agreements, and CMEC will be charged with ensuring that they are current and robust. There are a range of issues surrounding that. We do not preclude the register, but we leave it to CMEC to take a view on it in due course. </p>

<p> I want to return to something that you mentioned a moment ago, which probably links to the question that I want to ask. I want to talk about the record of accuracy in calculations. You touched on that, and on the voluntary agreements. However, something that you said about the voluntary agreements concerned me. You talked about the client surveys, and how you were asking people what suits them: whether it was the mortgage payments, or a payment directly to a child. However, there is no specific monitoring of that. It immediately occurred to me that a voluntary agreement might be entered into, part of which is that the mortgage payment is covered, but if it is not, and the parent defaults on those payments, that leaves the parent who is caring for the children in a very vulnerable position. Do you not think that if people are entering into those voluntary agreements, and allowing parents to take on voluntary responsibilities which would have such immense consequences, it is appropriate for such provision to be voluntary, and not obligatory?</p>
<p>Secondly, I have a number of cases where there have been inaccurate calculations of the amount that the father was due to pay or receive. That causes all MPs a huge amount of problems and work, as well as distress to parents. What will happen to ensure that we no longer have that huge margin of discrepancy? It has been a shambles. The record of accuracy in calculating payments is poor.

<p><span class="italic">  Hilary Reynolds:  </span> I was simply trying to share some of the ways in which parents have made voluntary agreements that suit their circumstances and those of their children. The interest that we have as a policy, and which CMEC will have as a statutory objective, is to maximise the maintenance arrangements that are in place and working. However, people will interpret their provision of that maintenance through different sources, and that may vary according to the different parents. It is not about us saying, &ldquo;Thou shalt pay mortgages instead of an up-front sum,&rdquo; which is what some people have suggested might suit their circumstances.</p>

<p> I understand that, but personal circumstances change. A couple on one day may think that it is appropriate and suitable, for example, for the absent father to pay the mortgage on a house lived in by the mother and two children; that may be suitable on day one. However, six months later he may default on that and the relationship may have broken down further. The agreement may not be as harmonious any longer. Should there not be some kind of monitoring to ensure that the voluntary agreement is adhered to?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> In terms of the inaccurate calculations, Stephen may want to comment further but I think it is right to say that there have been significant improvements under the operational improvement plan, which is only just through its first of &nbsp;three years. Under the new basis of assessment, fewer bits of information are needed to make the calculation. The key bit of information, which is the income, will in most cases come from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs. It will not be necessary to rely on the non-resident parent to do the calculation. That will greatly assist with accuracy also.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Geraghty:  </span> Accuracy is clearly important, but sometimes we make too much of it. We measure accuracy to a penny. Our new assessments, on the last decision, are currently about 80 per cent. accurate to a penny. That includes procedural things. For instance, with the much quoted 65 per cent. of liability orders that were inaccurate, the sample consisted of 54 cases, 11 of which involved a mathematical problem so that they were a penny or more out. Most of the other problems were such things as taking too many days to pass on the file, or not taking legal follow-up action to get missing information. The accuracy statistics include procedural matters.</p>
<p>That is not to say that accuracy is not important. For the enforcement work that we are now doing we have just done a very big sample. An external auditor did 700 cases and we did 42,000 internally before we passed them on to debt collectors. The accuracy to a penny is more than 90 per cent. People have a chance to appeal to us and then to a social security and child support appeals tribunal if they think that the assessment is inaccurate. Mechanisms are there. I am not minimising the problems; I would like 100 per cent. accuracy and procedural adherence, but the monetary amounts of inaccuracy are relatively small.</p>

<p>I understand what you say about the three-year improvement plan, which is 12 months in, because I served on a Statutory Instrument Committee six months ago when the issue was discussed. I understand that improvements are being made, and am happy to agree with that. However, we are going into another new system. Most of the inaccuracies of the previous system came about in the initial set-up and rolling out, and we are just beginning to put the problems right, 12 months into a three-year improvement plan; what guarantees are there that we will not incur problems with the new system? It is great that there is 90 per cent. accuracy, but that is now, with a system that you know, which has been operational for years and has been assessed, and which has an improvement plan. We are now going straight into a new system. Are we in danger of falling through the same trapdoors as before?</p>

<p> I have a quick point. In our questioning we have talked about the use of the quite rightly tougher enforcement powers. Given that those powers are available much earlier than the new assessment systems, will they be used looking very carefully at the assessments that have been made? Tougher enforcement is very good, but not if we are trying to toughly enforce an incorrect assessment. We need to link the accuracy of the assessment to the enforcement powers; otherwise, a number of cases will be made much of in which those powers, which are rightly available, are being used when the assessment is wrong. That will not get the new commission off to a good start.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> I agree absolutely. It is absolutely right that we do what you say and ensure that the assessment is right before we use the enforcement powers. The challenge has been that in the past the CSA has not used the powers that it has, but I think that that is changing under the operational improvement plan. Part of the reason that it is changing is that not only are more resources being deployed in enforcement, but there is improved accuracy on assessments.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Geraghty:  </span> Even before we transfer the debt to a debt collector, we rework the case and produce a breakdown of the account, which is available to the non-resident parent to challenge. Sometimes, people will view an inaccurate assessment as one that we should have recalculated because there was other information. For the privacy of the non-resident parent we do not always give the parent with care the full reasons that an assessment has changed, and there can be quite a big change if new information comes to light. But of the liability orders that we go for in the magistrates court, less than 1 per cent. are turned down. There is a fair degree of comfort in that.</p>

<p> I do. Very quickly, on the enforcement powers, clause 25, on disqualification for holding or obtaining travel authorisation, allows the commission itself to make an order. Under clause 28, which talks about disqualification for holding or obtaining a driving licence, the commission has to seek &nbsp;a court order. Why the difference? Furthermore, given that &ldquo;travel authorisation&rdquo; means also identity cards&mdash;I do not wish to rehearse the arguments about those&mdash;and that the Government&rsquo;s vision is that, at some point, ID cards will have a role beyond travel and allow access to other public services, is the ability to disqualify someone from holding an ID card limited to the travel nature of that card, or will it include access to other public services?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Mr. Plaskitt:  </span> We feel that there is a difference between those two sanctions&mdash;the driving licence and the travel document&mdash;which is why we have pursued different routes. Let us take the driving licence first. We feel that the consequences of withdrawing a driving licence are markedly and quantitively different from those that could follow on from the removal of travel documentation. For example, if we take away a driving licence but the person still drives, there are implications for insurance and any third party that might then be involved&mdash;let us say that there is an accident or injury on the road. Because it has a much wider circle of ramifications, it is appropriate to pursue an order through the courts. Travel documentation, however, requires rather more discretionary activity with no potential third party impact. It is a decision on whether a non-resident parent goes on holiday.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> We would like as many of those old debts to be cleared as possible. Obviously, that is quite resource-intensive, and Stephen may wish to comment on that. One of things that it is proposed we do is, rather than write off debt, create a provision for reflecting the effect of inflated or uncollectible debt in the account. However, those debts would remain in being and would not be written off until there is consent from the parent with care.</p>

<p> Will you look at the old cases to determine how many of them are inflated? I appreciate the point about the interim assessments, but most of those arose because the absent parent refused to deliver the information, so they were used specifically as a sanction in the first instance. There is some concern that by effectively running around the agency for years, the absent parent will get a reward by the writing off of what was originally supposed to be a sanction. How will you look at that issue, as there may be some cases where people simply have not paid for many years?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Stephen Geraghty:  </span> The approach that we are taking at the moment&mdash;and some of this is fairly technical&mdash;is that we do sometimes broker deals between the parent with care and the non-resident parent. For instance, in &nbsp;two recent cases we assigned an Army pension from the non-resident parent to the parent with care, which will clear the debt over a period. However, the debt stays on our books.</p>
<p>In another case, the non-resident parent transferred his interest in a property to the parent with care, but, again, the debt will stay on our books. There are cases now in which we broker deals that we need to be able to tidy up in some way. There are also cases&mdash;usually where a solicitor or a pair of solicitors is involved&mdash;where those concerned will come to an agreement that there will be a payment, and we will not take active steps to pursue the balance. We have some cases like that now where both parents are happy, but the cases need tidying up.</p>
<p>We have taken each of the cases that are above certain thresholds and allocated them to people to pursue, to look at whether the debt can be reworked and whether it is accurate, and to take whatever recovery action is appropriate. There comes a point in any debt collection exercise where it is a question of how much we can get. I think that we are a long way from that, but presumably the commission and Parliament will, at some point, want to consider whether they want to keep the debts going. Debts owed by parents who have died are still on the books, which is clearly absurd. It is a question of the commission putting proportionate effort into collecting as much debt as it can while there is still some benefit to be had&mdash;hopefully for the children, but at least for the parent with care.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Lord McKenzie:  </span> It is an interesting question. We thought long and hard about retaining that power in the Bill. It relates to the possibility of selling debts, to see whether more money can be raised that way. I think that we know that the private sector would have an interest in the debt book, although it would possibly be fairly limited. We also know that it would be interested in what one might term the low-hanging fruit&mdash;the debt that is easier to collect. In any event, that would probably need liability orders attached for the private sector to take an interest. The private sector would not necessarily have the range of enforcement powers that CMEC will have.</p>
<p>We saw that there were pretty limited, if any, circumstances, in which the power would be used, but we thought that, on balance, it was right to retain it so that it would be available if market circumstances changed. If some debt is taking an inordinate time to collect, there might be circumstances in which the parent would prefer some cash immediately. We do not foresee an early and robust use of that provision, however. The power is clinging on in the Bill because we think that it might be of some use in the future.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Hilary Reynolds:  </span> The recovery assumptions in the regulatory impact assessment use existing data on compensation payments and industrial injury benefit payments, so we believe that they are reasonably robust. The RIA gives indicative payment levels for a cost-neutral scheme. If recoveries are lower than predicted, payments might be lower; if recoveries are higher, payments could be higher, so we have taken a central estimate.</p>

<p> I have two very brief questions. I have some constituents who seem to be stuck for ever between their former employer and insurance &nbsp;company, and I cannot get either to move at any speed to take the issue forward. Has there been any thinking on such issues?</p>
<p>I want also to raise the issue of pleural plaques, on which there is an early-day motion signed by a number of Members. I recognise that this is not as serious a medical condition as mesothelioma, but it is distressing and causes anxiety. Could the Minister or anyone present tell us what view the Department takes on pleural plaques?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Mr. Plaskitt:  </span> I will try. My understanding of pleural plaques is that it can have a variety of contributing causes. It is not a narrowly defined disease which is solely the result of exposure to asbestos. Pleural plaques can arise for reasons other than asbestos. That is why there is a separate approach.</p>

<p> What about the length of time that cases can be stuck between employers and insurance companies? In some cases, constituents are compensated quite quickly. Perhaps they had a smarter lawyer or the employer was feeling a bit more generous that day, but in more serious cases, there seems to be no cut-off period.</p>
