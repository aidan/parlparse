<p> Good morning, Mr. Hurst. Welcome back to the Chair.</p>
<p> In Committee last Thursday, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport said: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''I am sorry that the hon. Member for Vale of York has left the Room for a moment. Since she is not here, now is perhaps the moment to complete my remarks.''&mdash;[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 27 February 2003; c. 408.]</span></p>
<p> I did not intend to appear rude or disrespectful to the Under-Secretary, but I had not had the chance to wash my hands in three and a half hours. I am sorry that while I was responding to a call of nature, the Under-Secretary refused to allow my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) to intervene on my behalf for precisely one minute. I am sure that we will be sitting for equally long periods between now and the end of the Committee proceedings, so may I make a plea for a comfort stop before we continue to a later hour, Mr. Hurst? </p>
<p> The clause deals with detention pending arrival of the police and refers to the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, among others. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 will of course also apply. [Interruption.] The Committee is especially noisy today; it is good to see its members in such good heart. </p>
<p> The very useful explanatory notes, which I presume the Department provided, tell us: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''At present, local bye-laws allow some harbour authority officials to exercise powers to detain ships whose pilots are suspected to be committing an offence of being impaired by drink or drugs. Clause 81 extends this regime to allow marine officials to detain a vessel when they reasonably suspect that a person on board is committing an offence under this Part. However, this clause does not apply to ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in order not to affect the operational effectiveness of the armed forces.''</span></p>
<p> I do not know whether it is appropriate to make that point now or when we come to clause 87, but suffice it to say that one hopes that separate checks are carried out in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary to ensure that its personnel would not fall foul of the Bill. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will put my mind at rest when he replies. That raises another question, which I am sure the Under-Secretary will want to address. If a harbour master or harbour official is invited to carry out checks under the clause, will they fall foul of the strict provisions on intoxication? </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/895" speakername="Don Foster" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s01.htm" colnum="409">
<p> May I remind the hon. Lady that I previously moved an amendment suggesting that harbour masters should be included in a list earlier in</p>
<p> the Bill? If I have an opportunity to bring that amendment back, I hope that she may be willing to support me.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s01.htm" colnum="410">
<p> As my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge said, we would certainly look at that. It would be an extremely useful probing amendment.</p>
<p> Obviously, one is grateful for the thoughts of the industry. In February, the newspaper of the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers, the NUMAST Telegraph, stated: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''The Bill will give police new powers to test seafarers for alcohol and drugs after an accident or where they have reason to believe an offence is being committed, and to arrest them without warrant.''</span></p>
<p> The article, which is on page 20, states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Harbourmasters will also be able to detain ships until police arrive if they believe a seafarer on board is over the limit.''</span></p>
<p> The article gives a little of the background. In relation to a point that has been well made in Committee, it states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''During consultations over the new laws, the government took onboard NUMAST's argument that ships are effectively homes as well as workplaces&mdash;determining that the regulations would not normally apply to off-duty seafarers unless they would need to safeguard passengers in an emergency.''</span></p>
<p> That is particularly appropriate. The article states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''While not resisting the new regulations, the Union had argued that existing provisions within section 58 of the Merchant Shipping Act gave the authorities adequate powers to address any alcohol abuse at sea.''</span></p>
<p> I believe that that is a serious charge, and I urge the Under-Secretary to address it today. The point was well and forcefully made by as eminent a union as NUMAST during the consultations, and presumably that was the purpose of having, at considerable expense, such lengthy consultations. </p>
<p> If the point was well made, we should like to know, although we broadly support the Bill, why the Government felt it important to go further and introduce the new law. We want to know why section 58 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 did not, in the Government's view, give the authorities adequate powers to address any alcohol abuse at sea. Why do they so dramatically part company from NUMAST, which is highly respected? </p>
<p> Powerful points were made by a number of other bodies during consultation. We have some concern, along with the Liberal Democrats, as to who the ''marine official'' will be. The relevant points were well made last week. A ship may be some considerable way from a police station, so detaining a ship pending the arrival of the police could put marine officials under considerable stress. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" speakername="John Randall" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s01.htm" colnum="410">
<p> Perhaps my hon. Friend can help me out. The clause applies not only to the sea, but to inland water. However, ''marine'' implies to me the sea. Is another part of the clause concerned with inland waterways?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s01.htm" colnum="410">
<p> My hon. Friend raises a very serious point. The Bill appears to be silent&mdash;perhaps we are missing something&mdash;on who the arresting official would be in the event of a vessel or craft committing an offence on an inland waterway. As the Committee will recall, I have a particular concern</p>
<p> about inland waterways. I cannot claim that Vale of York is a coastal constituency. Although we are under water a lot of the time, it is inland. The Bill is defective in that regard. Who would the marine official be? Do the Government expect it to be a member of the police force, in which case would it be a local police officer, or would it be a British Transport police officer? The Government must answer that question.</p>
<p> We recognise that there have been few instances in which clauses 80 or 81 would have been invoked. The dreadful tragedy of the Marchioness disaster is probably the most graphic example to date. Although the Under-Secretary argued that section 58 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 was sufficient, there probably is a need for further powers. The industry as a whole puts safety first and is therefore hopeful that it can work with all the authorities. However, even the industry has some concern about who the marine official would be. </p>
<p> It would be helpful if the Minister could give us some idea of the penalties. I referred briefly to NUMAST's concern about whether section 58 of the Merchant Shipping Act was sufficient. It sets out a fine of £5,000 or two years' imprisonment for a master or seaman who is guilty of endangering his ship or other ships while under the influence of drink or drugs. I do not immediately see a clause on penalties. Obviously, the Bill is not mine, but the Government's, so why is there such a serious gap? We will spend time this morning looking at detention, arrest without warrant and right of entry, but I do not see where the penalties are set out. Will we rely on the penalties in the Merchant Shipping Act, and if we will, why do we not rely on the other provisions of that Act? </p>
<p> According to my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, a marine official has said that the provision relates to coastal areas or shipping in United Kingdom waters. Certainly the British Marine Federation would like the Bill to differentiate between commercial shipping and recreational boating. I mentioned that I was a guest of the BMF at the London boat show. I saw some magnificent river and inland waterways craft there that would appeal to both my hon. Friends the Members for Uxbridge and for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), and which obviously sail on different waters and face different conditions. How will the clause differentiate between the types of vessel? </p>
<p> The clause refers to detention. I am not sure whether clauses 80 and 81 tell us where the tests would be carried out. The consultation document set out the problems. As the industry recognised, time is critical in the test analysis process. The practicality and cost of carrying out tests on vessels that may be a considerable distance from the shore would make random testing neither justified nor practical. The industry believes that such checks should be carried out only following an incident. </p>
<p> The question of at what point and on what occasion the tests would be carried out is a constant theme in the Government's responses to consultation on this part of the Bill. I said at our last sitting how difficult it was to get hold of those replies, as they are not on the </p>
<p> web. The Government usefully supplied a summary on the web of their replies to responses to the consultation paper on part 3, relating to the British Transport police. I have had to rely on the Library and the good services of the House to provide the replies to part 4, which is highly regrettable because a lot of useful information from the consultation process has yet to be addressed. </p>
<p> It is not clear from clause 81 whether the Government will introduce random testing on inland waterway and sea craft plying UK waters. Is it implicit that a test will be carried out only if an accident, or what might be described as a near miss, has occurred? If the Government do not satisfactorily answer that, we may return to the matter on Report. </p>
<p> It is extremely important to know who will carry out the tests. The clause refers to detention pending the arrival of police, which could be a considerable time. It is considered that the police service can be the only body equipped to enforce legislation; other agencies such as harbour authorities and navigation bodies are not trained or equipped to carry out the task of arresting members of the public, submitting them to breath-testing procedures, and dealing with the associated court appearances. The Liberal Democrats said that harbour masters should also be treated&mdash;[Interruption.] I hope that that cough is not serious; I refuse to be distracted. Harbour masters and marine or navigation officials should be above reproach in that regard; they must show that they, too, have not consumed alcohol or drugs, and that should be written into the Bill. </p>
<p> As we said in debates on part 1, in view of the extensive powers being given to investigators and inspectors of the rail accident investigation branch, we would prefer them to be accompanied in every eventuality by a British Transport police constable. Police officers are best equipped in that respect as they are trained to cope with difficult situations. We can all imagine anyone who is the worse for the drink in charge of a craft&mdash; </p>

<p> We do not know anyone who is the worse for drink.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s02.htm" colnum="412">
<p> I think we can imagine someone like that. People who are the worse for drink may be aggressive and unpleasant and might resist arrest. A marine official or an official from the navigation authority would not be trained or equipped to cope with such a situation. How will the Government tackle that? In view of current police resources and priorities, that leads to further concern that new measures, such as clauses 80 to 82, may be damaging to the boating market if they are not policed consistently throughout the UK. All police forces operate on the basis of policing priorities, which are determined locally through consultation with communities and nationally with the Home Secretary. The Bill does not lay out any policy on how a marine official, be it a harbour master, navigation officer, port official or anyone else, should react in trying to apprehend and arrest a person who could be behaving bizarrely and in a difficult manner.</p>
<p> It seems unlikely that the majority of constabularies would allocate resources to this as a priority area, when faced with other day-to-day demands. This year, the Vale of York area has been allocated a stand-still budget, and will be left with an £8.2 million shortfall. I do not see how a local constabulary such as the North Yorkshire police could be expected to deal with a scenario such as that put to the Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, in which a crew of a recreational craft on an inland waterway such as that near Roecliffe and Boroughbridge caused a severe hazard both to themselves and to others plying that water. There is a range of interests to be considered: those of British Waterways, tourism, the boating industry, and the safety of the waterways. I believe it to be grossly unfair to place such additional responsibilities on that local police force when its budget has been cut by £8.2 million. </p>
<p> At the time of the consultation&mdash;I do not believe that the situation has changed since then&mdash;there were only six police forces in the UK with active marine sections. I do not believe that North Yorkshire is one of those, for reasons that I mentioned earlier. There are, therefore, only six police forces in the UK that would be capable of actively responding to and policing the new legislation. With only a handful of constabularies able to enforce the new legislation, and others with no prospect of additional resources, policing practice on a geographical basis would inevitably be unequal. North Yorkshire might be compared with Cumbria, and Devon and Cornwall with Durham, and that comparison would not be fair. Overstretched police forces throughout the UK will be asked to take on more duties at a difficult time for them. </p>
<p> We have not been told that that is one of the new Government targets. It remains to be seen whether the Government will amend those targets, to which they are wedded, once the Bill becomes law. </p>
<p> Moreover, it is unlikely that police officers would attempt to stop or board large ships or fishing vessels making their way through UK deep waters. Therefore, in the view of the marine industry, the focus of attention would be turned to the so-called easy option of the private leisure boater, using inland or near-to-coast waters. The British Marine Industries Federation is concerned that that situation would inevitably produce unfair and unequal policing practice. </p>
<p> To put the matter in context, the British Marine Industries Federation has approximately 1,500 members. Its members provide boats, equipment, facilities and services that enable 9 million British people to use boats on the coast and inland waterways. The UK's boating industry is wholly comprised of small or medium-sized companies, which jointly generated an annual turnover of £2.4 billion in 1998, of which £566 million was derived from export sales. The industry directly employs more than 23,000 people. </p>

<p> industry, but the point that the Committee is dealing with is narrower.</p>

<p> The point is that a representative organisation such as the British Marine Industries Federation would not condone individuals taking charge of a vessel while being incapable due to the influence of alcohol, but it does not believe that there is sufficient evidence that that is a widespread problem. However, it believes that its members will be easily targeted, because they cannot escape quickly; they tend not to travel as far or as fast as commercial traffic. I hope that the Under-Secretary's responses this morning will put their minds at rest.</p>
<p> What will the additional cost of the clause be? Presumably, the Government will have to pay for a marine official's time and for the transport to get that official on board the boat. I assume that the Department has thought through the problem; it has had long enough to prepare the Bill. Before 1997, when we were in government, we were strongly committed to introducing such a Bill and to set it in motion. We would also like to hear where the resources needed will come from. </p>
<p> The United Kingdom Major Ports Group made equally valid representations in connection with the clause in the consultation. [Interruption.] I welcome back the Minister of State, Department of Transport. I hope that we will not lose either of our distinguished Ministers through ill health today. That would be most regrettable. We shall endeavour to nurture them for the rest of the Committee. </p>
<p> The United Kingdom Major Ports Group raised the question of who should be covered; that argument has been well rehearsed. It also asked about the penalties. It thinks that they should be severe, and that a ship's officer found to be over the blood alcohol level limit should have his certificate withdrawn or be suspended in addition to suffering a fine. Personally, I believe that that would be going quite far. </p>

<p> Order. I think that the hon. Lady is considering the wrong clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="9:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s02.htm" colnum="414">
<p> Perhaps the Minister could say which clause sets out the penalties, because I cannot find it. If we are to detain ships with a view to prosecuting for an offence, we should know what the penalties are.</p>
<p> The United Kingdom Major Ports Group also mentioned the circumstances in which the test should be carried out. It said that accidents are mercifully few, but that there should be a power to require a breath test not only when a crew member is involved in an accident, but when there is reason to suppose that he is in breach of the law. I wonder whether the Minister could elucidate that point. Are the Government considering random breath-testing and detention of ships, or would the clause apply only when there had been an accident? </p>
<p> Who would carry out the test? The group says that some ports have their own police officers, and in those cases, the ports should be given the power to administer the police tests. It also mentions that legislation would entail small additional costs for </p>
<p> port authorities; their officials might be asked to board the vessel with a view to detaining an accused person prior to the police arriving. Before the consultation, the Government emphasised safety within harbours, which the ports support. Ports would not wish to resist the proposals on the ground of cost, but that begs the serious question of what those costs would be, and who would pay them. </p>
<p> The marine section of the United Kingdom Pilots Association also raised some interesting issues. Its preference would be for testing only when there has been an accident. Will a pilot from that association be considered a 'marine official' for the purposes of the clause, and is it envisaged that he will board the ship? The clause does not go far enough. The Committee and the industry would like to know precisely who it is envisaged will board ships under the clause. </p>
<p> In Belfast a magistrate heavily fined a Scandinavian master for endangering his own and other vessels in the port under the existing provisions. We feel that the existing Act is workable, but further information is required. </p>
<p> I alluded earlier to an interesting question that was raised by the United Kingdom Pilots Association. The legislation covers UK ships in UK waters, but does it also include all foreign merchant ships and merchant seamen operating in UK waters? What jurisdiction would a UK marine official have when boarding a foreign vessel plying UK waters? Is that allowable under clause 81? </p>
<p> The British Ports Association appears to be involved under the very loose drafting of clause 81, and it has no strong views on whether legislation should cover UK ships when outside UK waters. There may be problems in applying the laws realistically out at sea, and those are recognised in the consultation paper. There is a scenario where a ship in UK waters, to which clause 81 would apply, takes itself out of UK waters as quickly as possible, and therefore presumably outside the provisions of the Bill. </p>
<p> Can the Minister tell us what the powers of hot pursuit are in the event of a vessel fleeing from the scene of the crime after an accident or near miss? Does clause 81 allow a marine official pending the arrival of the police to hot-pursue that craft until they have apprehended it? The British Ports Association agrees that testing should take place after an accident and when there is reason to suspect a breach of the law. It stated: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''We would not support&mdash;and we do not believe there are resources to do this anyway&mdash;a wider regime of random breath testing. Resources should be directed towards cases where there are strong reasons to believe that an offence has occurred.''</span></p>
<p> It went on to say: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''We strongly believe that it is the police who should carry out the testing and we would not seek powers for harbour authority staff to take on this role.''</span></p>
<p> Can the Minister clarify the relationship of clause 81 to clause 82? Who will perform the test? The British Ports Association says: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Some ports have their own police and in such cases, they would carry out the testing. We believe that the police have the necessary authority and expertise to carry out this task and to gather prosecution evidence. This might require extra resources being made available to the police to cope with this task, but we see little point in introducing new legislation which cannot be properly backed up by the authorities.''</span></p>
<p> Can the Minister tell us what those extra resources would be, and from which budget they would come? If we are going to support clause 81, as we feel inclined to, those questions will need to be answered. </p>
<p><span class="indent">Who is going to carry out the test? Is the marine official going to be allowed only to detain and to board the ship while awaiting the police? Who is going to pay for their time? The British Ports Association says:</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">''As port authorities we do not envisage any significant additional costs, although we base this on the assumption that the police will carry out testing.''</span></p>
<p> We asked earlier whether additional resources were to be provided for the British Transport police. Under clauses 81 and 82, it is appropriate to ask the Under-Secretary about any additional resources for the police for these purposes. </p>
<p> Clause 81(1) says: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''A marine official may detain a ship if he reasonably suspects that a person who is . . . on board the ship''</span></p>
<p> has committed or is committing an offence. Must an accident have occurred, or is it sufficient if a marine official believes that an accident is likely to occur because of the behaviour of the relevant person? </p>
<p> Under subsection (2), the ''power of detention'' is </p>
<p><span class="indent">''conditional upon the marine official making a request . . . for a constable in uniform to attend''</span></p>
<p> and it </p>
<p><span class="indent">''lapses when a constable in uniform has decided whether or not to exercise a power''.</span></p>
<p> As I said in respect of clause 80, it is important to know the status of a constable who is not in uniform. An officer sent out as a matter of urgency may not be in uniform at the precise moment. </p>
<p> I understand that the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 covers circumstances in which an officer out of uniform can fulfil his responsibilities. I hope that clause 81 will not fall in circumstances where the constable is inadvertently not able to wear his uniform, which would defeat the whole purpose of the clause. As I said, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act sets out the circumstances in detail, but we want to know exactly how they will apply in this particular case. </p>
<p> Will the Under-Secretary confirm that the 1984 Act sets out that a person on a vessel could be detained for a maximum period of 24? I presume that a review will take place every six hours. That raises the question I asked earlier. If a person accused of an offence is intoxicated, the effects of the alcohol will inevitably wear off, so at what point will the breath samples be taken? How is the period of detention defined? How will an application be made on a boat at sea to have the period of detention reviewed? If I am right about the six-hour period&mdash;I may, of course, be wrong&mdash;will the 24-hour period be the maximum? </p>
<p> A marine official is defined as </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a harbour master, or an assistant of a harbour master'',</span></p>
<p> but it is clear from submissions to the original consultation made by the industry, the pilots, the UK Pilots Association and the British Ports Association that many people are concerned about the persons listed in section 284 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. For convenience, I managed to copy the relevant provisions of the 1995 Act. Section 284(1)(a) includes </p>
<p><span class="indent">''any commissioned naval or military officer''.</span></p>
<p> Under clause 81, such an officer may operate as a marine official, but we are told that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service is excluded from the Bill. Does that exclusion mean that officers of the fleet are not permitted to operate as a marine official? Section 284(1)(b) includes ''any Departmental officer'', so will Department for Transport officials be seconded to act temporarily as a marine official for the purposes of clause 81? Is that what the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and clause 81 intend to allow? </p>
<p> Section 284(1)(c) includes </p>
<p><span class="indent">''any officer of customs and excise''.</span></p>
<p> I know that those good men and women are often burly creatures, and they are used to seizing illegal drugs and drink, but how will they be qualified to apprehend, detain and accuse people who may be highly intoxicated and very aggressive? Section 284(1)(d) includes ''any British consular officer'', but as the Bill is about operations in UK waters, I do not see how many British consular officers will be to hand. I may be wrong. An off-duty British consular officer may be on a vessel and get a radio call from his boss to respond to an emergency and detain a ship. However, considering the provisions in both clause 81 and the 1995 Act, it strikes me that not many such people will be available to apprehend and detain the people accused of committing an offence. </p>
<p> I will support what the Government are trying to do, providing that they respond to the points of NUMAST and the British Marine Industries Federation about section 58 of the 1995 Act. I want also to know how detention will be paid for and what extra resources will be given. I assume that detention will be empowered only when the marine official has been clearly identified and has applied for a constable in uniform to attend, and will lapse when that constable has decided whether to exercise his power. Detention should not last for more than 24 hours and should be reviewed after six hours. </p>
<p> Will the Under-Secretary tell us whether, if there is a 24-hour detention, the person who detains the ship will be empowered to perform the test? Will he rule out any random testing and confirm that testing and detention will happen only in the event of an accident? In the rare event that a constable is not in uniform at the time, is the Under-Secretary satisfied that the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 allows that constable to operate under the provisions of clause 81? How strictly will the term ''constable in uniform'' apply? </p>
<p> The most serious charge that we lay against the clause is that section 284(1) of the 1995 Act and </p>
<p> subsections (3) and (4) are too narrow. I repeat that section 284(1) provides only that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Where under this Act a ship is to be or may be detained any of the following officers may detain the ship&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent"> (a) any commissioned naval or military officer,</span></p>
<p><span class="indent"> (b) any Departmental officer,</span></p>
<p><span class="indent"> (c) any officer of customs and excise, and</span></p>
<p><span class="indent"> (d) any British consular officer.''</span></p>
<p> We are looking at a huge area&mdash;the whole of the UK's waterways, including its inland waterways&mdash;and that is not enough to cover it. </p>
<p> We would also like a response on hot pursuit. </p>

<p> I will conclude on the following point. We would like to know whether it is envisaged that other officers will be covered under section 284 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. If that Act is to be amended in that regard, why is that not set out in the clause? Will it cover a port official, a pilot or anybody else in addition to a harbour master? As drafted, clause 81 is defective.</p>

<p> I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends the Ministers will resist the thrust of what the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) has said.</p>
<p> I am sure that such quibbles about other laws on alcohol and drugs&mdash;in relation to road traffic for example&mdash;have been made. We do not want the law to be made ineffectual because there are so many qualifications that the officials cannot take appropriate action. For instance, if a pilot were to board a supertanker full of oil in the Solent and could not, because of the law, do anything about the fact that all the crew were drunk and falling about and reeking of whisky, and if an accident occurred after that event, that would show that the law was ineffectual. I hope that the law will be made stronger so that it will have an effect and that accidents arising from drugs and alcohol will not occur in future. </p>

<p> I wish the Minister to clarify a couple of things.</p>
<p> In an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York, I alluded to the issue of jurisdiction. We have been discussing that, and we know that it does not apply just to the marine environment in the strict sense of that term. It applies to waterways within the UK, although I think that it does not apply to the internal waterways in Scotland. </p>
<p> I want to be given some idea of the difference between inland and internal. I am thinking about estuaries in particular. We all support the Bill, but&mdash;bearing in mind that it was largely inspired by the terrible Marchioness disaster&mdash;how does jurisdiction apply with regard to the Thames estuary? </p>
<p> We have not discussed the position of the river police&mdash;about how far they can operate and whether there would be any crossover. Essex and Kent border the Thames estuary: would the river police be able to cross into those jurisdictions, or would they stick strictly to the Metropolitan police area? </p>
<p> That is germane because of the term ''marine official''. I hope that the Minister will tell us that ''marine official'' does not relate merely to the sea because we would feel a lot happier if it went wider than that. My hon. Friend referred to clause 81(3)(c), which refers to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a person falling within a class designated by order of the Secretary of State.''</span></p>
<p> I presume that that order is still to come, and that the Secretary of State will introduce an order that describes the extra people who can be included as marine officials. I would be interested to learn what sorts of persons and jobs the Government envisage might be included in such an order so that we have an idea of their intention. </p>
<p> My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York talked about detention and periods of time. I believe that she was referring to individuals, but the clause refers to ships, not individuals. I wonder, therefore, whether there is a time limit, or whether it is just one of those legal things. The clause does not appear to mention any period of time after which the ship can say, ''You can't keep us any longer.'' After all, there should be no question of the detention being unreasonable in the case of a commercial ship, or even a leisure craft. The hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) might give the example of an oil tanker sailing up the Solent. If the tanker were detained for some time, and it was then discovered that the allegation that had led to it being boarded was unfounded, could the company or the ship's owner be compensated? Would that be deemed fair? Would the case go to a civil court? </p>
<p> Subsection (2)(a) refers to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''the marine official making a request''.</span></p>
<p> Because of the nature of what we are discussing, I presume that that request could be made in any form, including by telephone. It would not have to be written. Similarly: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''when a constable in uniform has decided whether or not to exercise a power'',</span></p>
<p> how could anyone be sure that that came from a proper source? I am sure that there are proper methods of deciding that. </p>
<p> My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York also mentioned constables in uniform. That may have seemed slightly off the point, but it is not. I have often been told that if a police officer arrests someone and is not wearing his cap, he can be deemed to be improperly dressed, and the person cannot be charged. That may be an urban myth; I am fortunate enough not to have been in a position to test it. I am interested to know whether that applies to the marine environment, which, as we know, can be rather windy. What would happen if the constable's cap were blown off? That may seem slightly irrelevant, but will the Under-Secretary assure us for the record, and to avoid subsequent arguments in court and mounting lawyers' fees, that constables setting off </p>
<p> properly dressed would be deemed to be correct enough? </p>
<p> I must say to my hon. Friend that I have my reasons for not having especially kind thoughts towards the British port authorities, as they were instrumental in scuttling my private Member's Bill on marine wildlife conservation, which had all-party support. However, I must not allow personal feelings to intervene. If I have to listen to their representations, I shall take them on merit and not out of any sense of revenge after what they did to my Bill. </p>

<p> I am pleased to see you back in the Chair this morning, Mr. Hurst.</p>
<p> In her opening remarks, which seem now to have been some time ago, the hon. Member for Vale of York asked if we might have a pit stop if the Committee proceedings continued for a long time. I must tell the hon. Lady that my contribution to the sitting to which she referred was preceded by nearly 50 minutes of her speech. I do not know whether the Scottish education system was the same as the English one at the time, but in my childhood I remember doing something in the English language called précis. If the hon. Lady does not know what that means, perhaps she can ask me afterwards. I am also reminded of someone who spoke at great length at a meeting. At the end, he apologised for not having had the time to shorten his speech. </p>
<p> The clause puts into statute what already exists in some harbour byelaws. Police presence is not as ubiquitous on the water as it is on the roads. That is why the proposals seek to give powers to, but not to impose duties on, marine officials to allow them to assist the police. In order to operate the testing regime in practice, it is necessary to put in place suitable powers to detain suspects for a reasonable time pending the arrival of the police. The police may then administer breath tests, arrest a crew member or a person exercising a navigational function who is suspected of being intoxicated or unfit either through alcohol or drugs. </p>
<p> In the same way that a store detective may detain a shoplifting suspect pending the arrival of the police, those powers may be triggered only when the marine official has reasonable grounds for suspicion that an offence under this part is being or has been committed. Examples of persons to be treated as marine officials under clause 81(3)(b) are: a commissioned naval or military officer; any departmental officer, including officers of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency; any officer of Customs and Excise; and any British consular official. </p>

<p> The Minister mentioned store detectives, which struck a chord with me. There is a valid case for store detectives having reasonable ground, but they are trained. The kinds of people the Minister illustrated under paragraph (b) will not necessarily have such detailed knowledge, and subsequent counter-charges could be brought against them for false detention. That is something store detectives have to be aware of.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.19" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="9:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s03.htm" colnum="421">
<p> I think we covered training in a previous sitting. In certain cases people will need training. However, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency is extremely familiar with the procedures. It is most likely to be involved and already has powers to detain ships over inadequate crewing or the maintenance of the ship.</p>
<p> Under clause 81(3)(b) the Secretary of State may by order designate other classes of persons as having the power to detain vessels, which was a point raised by the hon. Member for Vale of York. It will be important to define those groups of marine officials carefully. We have in mind officials from such organisations as British Waterways and the Broads Authority. I hope that that helps the hon. Member for Uxbridge with his concerns about inland waterways. </p>
<p> Safeguards are in place. The detention envisaged by the clause is conditional on a request for a police constable to attend being made as soon as possible. It will lapse if the police inform the marine official that they have decided not to take specimens. In reply to the hon. Member for Uxbridge, the constable could be summoned in any appropriate way. </p>
<p> I turn to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Vale of York&mdash;so long as she does not walk out on me. I am not used to ladies walking out on me, Mr. Hurst, not least the hon. Member for Vale of York. She asked about penalties. I know that we touched only briefly on clause 79 in our last sitting, but the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Uxbridge both contributed to a brief debate that covered the penalties, about which she asked several times. The hon. Member of Uxbridge asked in an intervention whether part 4 covered inland waterways. The answer is yes. </p>
<p> ''Marine official'' applies to inland water officials as well as those at sea. The reference to harbour officials clearly covers only harbours. Clause 81 will ensure that appropriate officials will be able to detain people outside harbours; that is, outside their jurisdiction. The hon. Member for Vale of York raised a new master point about powers needed to detain a vessel pending the police's arrival to conduct a breath test on someone suspected of committing an offence under this part of the Bill. The existing provisions apply to harbour authorities. Here we are widening the group of officials given the power to detain vessels by order. </p>
<p> The hon. Lady spoke at great length about testing and I assure her that in line with testing on the roads it will not be at random. In our last sitting, the hon. Lady spoke for nearly 50 minutes in the debate on clause 80, subsection (1) of which states that the power to require a specimen shall apply when </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a constable in uniform reasonably suspects that the person is committing an offence''.</span></p>
<p> There would have to be reasonable suspicion or an accident would have to have occurred, which is the case on the roads. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.20" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="9:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s04.htm" colnum="421">
<p> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is as courteous and charming as ever. If the constable is not present, how can he reasonably suspect anything? Will he rely on information being provided by other people that an offence has occurred</p>
<p> or is reasonably suspected of having occurred? If he is not physically present, how can he know?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.4.21" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="9:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s04.htm" colnum="422">
<p> The information will have been provided to the constable by the marine official, or he may have had a reasonable suspicion in the first place because of information that had been given to him.</p>
<p> The hon. Lady asked where the test would be carried out. The screening test on board the vessel would be conducted by a constable in uniform. Evidential testing is to be done by the police, and I understand that any such test must be carried out by a constable in uniform. I repeat that there will be no random testing. We may need to consider precisely what is meant by uniform if the hat has blown off and so on. There is plenty of case law on road policing in such matters, which we may explore if we want further information. </p>
<p> Legislation on the constable in uniform would apply to the local police, the ports police and, if appropriate, the British Transport police. In practice, it is likely to be the local police, as they will have the equipment and the expertise to enforce this part of the Bill. Marine officials will have the power to detain vessels until the police arrive and, as I said earlier, they can detain the vessel only when they have requested the police to attend. </p>
<p> The Maritime and Coastguard Agency plans to train a strategic number of police officers to board vessels in order to conduct the tests. The police will also have access to vessels used by harbour authorities and water authorities, should that be required. </p>
<p> The hon. Lady asked about hot pursuit, which is probably unlikely, although there are cases in which it is suspected that a serious offence has taken place and when pursuit is thought to be appropriate. There would be the power to track a vessel to see in which direction it was going, but in practice hot pursuit would not apply, although it would depend on what was deemed to be the severity of the situation. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for Vale of York asked about the definition of United Kingdom ships and foreign ships, which is set out in clause 88, which we shall discuss later this morning if time allows. We were asked about the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, which are civilian, not military, vessels. Clause 87 applies the Bill, except for clause 81, to those ships. Those on board will be covered by all the measures in this part of the Bill except that which applies to detaining ships in clause 81, for reasons which will be obvious to the Committee. </p>
<p> The hon. Lady also asked about consular officials; it is important that they have the power that she mentions because part 4 applies to United Kingdom ships anywhere in the world, not just off our coasts. Therefore, it may be appropriate for a consular official to act in such a capacity. </p>
<p> The hon. Lady asked several times about resources. I refer her to the explanatory notes to the Bill. The issue of any extra funding required is set out on page 25 in paragraph 92, headed ''Public sector financial and manpower cost''. I will not detain the Committee by reading it out, as it makes the points well. I hope </p>
<p> that I have given a helpful summary of the clause and that we can move on. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his explanations, as far as they went. He referred to paragraph 92, and it was remiss of me not to mention it earlier. It says:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''It is difficult to quantify the financial costs to the public purse from the introduction and enforcement of an alcohol limit for mariners.''</span></p>
<p> That may be difficult, but it is incumbent on the Government to do it. They are putting additional costs on several organisations&mdash;I will not list them again&mdash;who are concerned about the costs and whether they can pay them. </p>

<p> My hon. Friend is correct. If the notes had said that it was impossible to quantify the financial costs, we could let the Department off the hook, but as it is just 'difficult', the Department should come up with an answer.</p>

<p> Indeed. The Government have a Department dedicated to transport policy, so although it may be difficult to quantify costs, they should do it. The notes go on to say:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''The Association of Chief Police Officers has indicated that the slightly increased resource implications for the police would be largely offset by use of current resources such as harbour launches and search and rescue helicopters.''</span></p>
<p> For the benefit of the Committee, it is only thanks to our successful local campaign that the Portland helicopters were saved. They were about to be axed. </p>

<p> Order. The hon. Lady is aware that we are not debating helicopters.</p>

<p> The Minister referred me to the explanatory notes. We are debating helicopters because we are told that search and rescue helicopters will be doing the job, but they have only just been rescued themselves. If they had not been rescued, who would have been doing the work?</p>
<p> The notes say: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''The Department for Transport would fund any training necessary for police and marine officials to enforce these proposals.''</span></p>
<p> I hope that the Department has allowed itself enough time to do that. The notes add that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''the training would cover techniques in boarding ships at sea by means of helicopter or ship to ship transfers.''</span></p>
<p> Having tried the latter twice, I can say that it is the most inelegant exercise and is fraught with danger. I was pushed out of the way by an admiral. </p>

<p> We will not go into that. The point is that people can break their legs or do themselves even worse damage. Considerable training is required, and I would not like to undertake it.</p>
<p> The notes say: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''In terms of testing apparatus, there would be minimal costs for implementation of the alcohol provisions, since the testing regime would use equipment already in use for alcohol testing on the roads.''</span></p>
<p> I thought that I made an eloquent argument for using the testing equipment used on railways, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears. However, there is still time before the Bill comes into force. We are told that the number of tests required is expected to be low, as is the number cases prosecuted. </p>
<p> I welcome the fact that the Minister has said that the provisions will apply to all vessels in UK waters, irrespective of flag. I also welcome his assurance that breath-testing should primarily be carried out after an accident or if there is reason to suspect a breach of the law and that there will not be random testing. That is welcome. </p>
<p> We will certainly hold the Government to their commitment in paragraph 93 of the explanatory notes: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Alcohol and drugs provisions, both in the marine and aviation sectors, will not require recruitment of more public sector workers, though there will be additional responsibilities on existing police, marine or legal officers.''</span></p>
<p> No doubt, once the Bill is in force, we will have cause to revisit that. </p>
<p> The question of hot pursuit is a reasonable one that we will pursue on subsequent clauses. I am deeply uneasy about the reasonable time pending the arrival of the police because the Minister has confirmed that the police will conduct hot pursuit. The effects of alcohol may have worn off over the 24-hour detention period, and that could weaken the provisions of the clause. I share my hon. Friend's concern that the absence of the constable himself could be a hostage to fortune. I cannot speak for British Waterways, but I hope that it is happy to take on these new responsibilities. </p>
<p> Question put and agreed to. </p>
<p> Clause 81 ordered to stand part of the Bill. </p>

<p> Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. </p>

<p> We are told that a constable may arrest a person without warrant if he has reason to suspect that an offence has been committed or that the person who is suspected of having committed an offence is on board and under the influence of drink or drugs. The provisions come from part 4 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and part 5 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989.</p>
<p> The royal commission that preceded PACE said in its report that there was lack of clarity and an uneasy and confused mixture of common law and statutory powers of arrest&mdash;the statutory powers having grown up piecemeal and without any consistent rationale. Its objectives were therefore twofold: first, it would restrict arrest circumstances to those in which arrest is genuinely necessary, and secondly it would simplify, clarify and rationalise. One recommendation&mdash;not adopted&mdash;was that all imprisonable offences should become arrestable offences. </p>
<p> The report stated that the basic principle of arrest without warrant remained, whether or not an offence </p>
<p> carried a sentence of five years or more. The penalties under clause 79 are considerably less. The report then listed some offences that were not previously arrestable. Section 17 of PACE would apparently be enforced for the purposes of entry and search without warrant. It states that a constable may enter and search any premises for the purpose of executing a warrant of arrest or a warrant of commitment. Those powers are specific. My concern is how far reaching they are when no warrant is required. We have stated more than once that as far as possible arrest with warrant would be the preferred option for the relevant constable for part 4 purposes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge suggested, the river police might be involved, but it is more likely be the local police, the road police or possibly the British Transport police. Where a warrant is issued, rights pertain to the accused. How often is an arrest without warrant envisaged? Where a ship is at sea or in an inland waterway&mdash;a considerable distance away&mdash;the constable must be able to act speedily. </p>
<p> Subsection (2) states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''But a person may not be arrested under this section while he is at a hospital as a patient.''</span></p>
<p> Does that cover the position where a person accused of an offence is so intoxicated through the effects of drink or drugs that he has become ill? He might have caused an accident yet not be arrested. </p>
<p> The Committee will be aware of a solicitor in the Vale of York&mdash;he was also an acting coroner and a pre-eminent individual in the local society&mdash;being prosecuted for substantial fraud. Sadly, after he was sentenced, he suffered two heart attacks and when he was taken to hospital, he was manacled to the bed. We all understand the requirement not to lose a convicted criminal, but we also understand the trauma to the individual and his family. We should compare that scenario with the circumstances under the clause whereby an individual who has not been convicted, but is accused of committing a serious offence and endangering lives, cannot be arrested while in hospital as a patient&mdash;even though his own silly deeds had brought him to hospital in the first place. Will the Minister clarify the position? </p>

<p> People who cannot be arrested are often dealt with through the various cautions that can be given out, but does my hon. Friend agree that being at hospital is too wide-ranging an exemption?</p>

<p> That is precisely the point of clarification that I seek. My hon. Friend is obviously taking the same line of thinking as I am. We hope that people will not try to evade arrest by making themselves unavailable by virtue of being in hospital. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury is not here to assist me in this regard, as he is busy in another part of the House, but I believe that many ships have a hospital unit. If someone is to be arrested, the police constable will do the testing, so the person will have to be available for testing and arrest.</p>

<p> My hon. Friend touches on a point that I wanted to raise. I cannot understand why, if someone is incapable of being arrested in a hospital on</p>
<p> land, a person who has suffered an equally serious accident at sea and is in a ship's hospital as a result of his own actions, is not treated in the same way on board.</p>

<p> That is precisely the point that I hope that the Under-Secretary will clarify.</p>
<p> One scenario is that the person is so drunk or drugged that he falls and hurts himself and is taken off the ship to be placed in hospital. In that case, the person conveniently escapes arrest. Is the Under-Secretary saying that clause 82 means that people may also conveniently escape being tested if an accident has been caused and they are accused of an offence leading to it? </p>

<p> I assume that such people will not escape arrest, as the police will wait until a suitable time until they arrest them. However, that needs to be clarified.</p>

<p> We need clarification because we may fall foul of clause 81, which, we were told, must be followed in a reasonable time. We have raised some serious issues, and we need clarification, especially given the fact that the provisions relate to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and that the royal commission flagged up problems in principle about arrest without warrant and the statutory powers of arrest in general. I would take a dim view of clause 82 if it meant that a person accused of an offence, perhaps in the same scenario as the Marchioness disaster, would escape testing and arrest. Such a person should do so for only a limited time.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.6.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s05.htm" colnum="426">
<p> Clause 82 gives a police officer the right to arrest a person whom he suspects is committing or has committed an offence under part 4. The clause is necessary as it gives the police officer the power to take a suspect to a police station, where authorised equipment will be capable of taking a definitive reading of the amount of alcohol in a suspect's body. The provision reflects the power of arrest set out in section 4(6) of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</p>
<p> A police officer will not have the right to arrest someone who is in hospital as a patient. There was some suggestion that someone could walk through the door of a hospital and avoid arrest, but that would not be the case. Such a patient should be protected from the requirement to provide a specimen if the doctor in charge of his case objected on the basis that it would be prejudicial to the proper care and treatment of the patient. If the doctor in charge does not object, specimens of blood or urine may be taken for analysis in the laboratory. Provisions in the Road Traffic Act 1988, as implemented in the Bill by clause 80, deal with the provision of a specimen by a person in hospital. Those will apply in such a case. </p>
<p> A hospital means an institution that provides medical or surgical treatment for in-patients or out-patients. Some ships are equipped with hospital facilities, but we do not propose to extend the provision because a ship's doctor might not be sufficiently independent or detached from the </p>
<p> subject. Few ships have a hospital staffed by a qualified doctor&mdash;that may happen only on a large cruise ship. A ship may have a sick bay, in which some medical equipment is available, but a doctor would not generally administer treatment on most ships. It is very unlikely that a doctor will be in charge of such a patient on board a ship, and we therefore did not think it appropriate to include it in the provision. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.6.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" speakername="John Randall" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s05.htm" colnum="427">
<p> I understand what the Under-Secretary is saying about the provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1988, with which we would all agree, and that there may be occasions when someone's life is at risk. He used the word prejudicial, and I understand the points about the expertise or proximity of other crew members. However, is there not a chance that someone would insist on a sample being taken that would be prejudicial to the person's health, because there is no provision to safeguard them when they are at sea?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.6.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s05.htm" colnum="427">
<p> The clause provides the same position as exists on the roads. If a person were to have a sample taken, it would be taken at a police station and in the normal way in which it would be taken for a road traffic offence.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.6.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" speakername="John Randall" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s05.htm" colnum="427">
<p> I am trying to say that if someone were sufficiently injured not to be able to be moved to a police station but was on board a ship, a sample could still be taken or tests conducted that could be deemed to be prejudicial to that person's health.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.6.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s05.htm" colnum="427">
<p> Again, the same position applies in this respect as applies on the roads and in relation to a road traffic accident victim. If a person were unconscious, for example, a police officer at the roadside could not ask him to take a breath test, and a blood sample could not be taken at the side of the road. I think that exactly the same conditions would apply to someone who had an injury aboard a ship as apply to someone lying injured at the side of a road as a result of a road traffic accident.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.6.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" speakername="John Randall" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s05.htm" colnum="427">
<p> We are almost there. The Under-Secretary said that a blood sample could not be taken at the side of a road. However, as far as I can see, under the clause, a blood sample could be taken from anyone who was suspected of committing an offence under the relevant provision, regardless of their state of health, while they were on a ship. I seek clarification. At the moment, it seems that someone could insist on taking a blood sample while the person was unconscious.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.6.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s05.htm" colnum="427">
<p> The same would apply as elsewhere. First, the person would have to be arrested by the uniformed constable whom we discussed earlier. Then the same conditions would apply as apply under the road traffic legislation. A decision would have to be made. If a person was clearly in a serious condition because of an accident, exactly the same conditions would apply. The police would not have the means to do the blood test away from the station. They do not have the ability to do the blood test aboard the ship. They would have to be at the station. As I have said,</p>
<p> the same circumstances that apply to someone injured on the road would apply to someone on a ship.</p>
<p> Let me deal with the powers of arrest without warrant in the context of the breath test on the roads under section 6(5) of the Road Traffic Act. We simply wish to replicate what happens on the roads. The hon. Member for Vale of York asked about arrest with or without a warrant. I think that it is the case that arrest without a warrant would be the normal means of arrest for the offence that we are discussing, just as it is on the road for a drink-driving offence. </p>

<p> I am grateful for those clarifications, but it strikes me, in relation to some of the concerns that the Opposition have shared with the Committee, that there are clear differences in the application of this clause and clause 80 to a ship&mdash;whether at sea in UK waters or on inland waterways&mdash;from what pertains in respect of road traffic.</p>
<p> I understand that the Government have adopted some of the provisions from navigation functions as opposed to road functions. Clearly, the Under-Secretary and the rest of the Government will recognise that there will be many more practical difficulties in getting a constable on board a ship. We are not told anywhere what is a reasonable time. Nor have we been told what a reasonable time is for detention. Obviously, the person who is incapacitated and in hospital has the right to be treated and things must not interfere with his treatment, but he may escape prosecution even though his intoxication or the influence of drugs may have led to the accident. I hear what the Under-Secretary says, and his explanation of the provisions, but in those circumstances it would take longer to take a suspect to the police station where there would be equipment to take a specimen. A person could be in hospital for a considerable time, and I would like to place it on the record that, whatever the good reasons given by the Government, it would be regrettable if a person were to escape prosecution in those circumstances. </p>

<p> Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.8.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s05.htm" colnum="428">
<p> We are told in the explanatory notes that clause 83 differs slightly from the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Transport and Works Act 1992, in that it refers to ''reasonable force'' rather than ''by force''. Would the Minister care to establish the difference?</p>
<p> The Bill also allows the police officer to be accompanied, whereas the 1998 Act and the 1992 Act do not. We are also told that the Bill does not extend to Scotland, where adequate common law powers of entry exist. </p>
<p> The clause raises an interesting issue. The clause states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''A constable in uniform may board a ship''.</span></p>
<p> Does that power give a police officer the right of entry to a privately owned recreational craft or boat? The industry is concerned about that matter, which was raised during consultation but has not been resolved, and so would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could clarify it. If the Under-Secretary confirms that the police will have the power to board a recreational craft, does that mean that a police officer will have the right of entry to a privately owned recreational boat? Most of the Bill's provisions, largely because of the nature of the offences, seem to be aimed at commercial boats that carry substantial numbers of people. Will privately owned boats also be covered? </p>
<p> Paragraphs 94 to 98 of the explanatory notes refer to the human rights dimension&mdash;as we saw in part 3 relating to the British Transport police. They refer particularly to the following articles of the European convention on human rights, now enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998: article 5, guaranteeing the right to liberty and security, article 6, guaranteeing the right to a fair trial, and article 8, guaranteeing the right to respect for private and family life. I believe that those articles could be used as a defence to frustrate the intentions of the Bill. The explanatory notes state: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Article 5 is subject to the qualification of lawful arrest on reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed or for its prevention. The powers of arrest and detention contained in this Part are considered necessary and proportionate and within the qualification mentioned.''</span></p>
<p> Playing devil's advocate, I beg to differ. I believe that there will be circumstances in which those articles might be an accused person's first line of defence, either for a commercial or a privately owned ship. The private owner of a recreational craft could use colourful language to tell the police constable or a detaining officer to go about his business because he or she wants to enjoy the private property. </p>
<p> The explanatory notes state: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Article 6 (which is linked to a privilege against self-incrimination) is engaged principally by the provisions requiring specimens of breath, blood or urine to be provided by a suspect. However, the courts have held that the privilege is not absolute in circumstances where a proportionate response is required to combat a serious social problem.''</span></p>
<p> The Government argue that this is considered to be such a case. A defence lawyer would probably argue that it is not. Again, in addition to article 5, could article 6 be used to frustrate the Government's intentions? </p>
<p> The explanatory notes continue: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Article 8 is subject to the qualification that a public authority may interfere with the right to private and family life provided that it does so in a proportionate manner for the prevention of crime and the protection of the public.''</span></p>
<p> Again, article 8 could be used by any decent defence lawyer to argue that the clause prevents an individual from having the right to enjoy his or her private and family life and, per se, his or her private yacht or inland waterway craft. The Government consider the clause to be compatible with the European convention on human rights, but the Opposition's concern is that any half decent, self-respecting defence lawyer will use it to frustrate the intentions behind the clause. </p>
<p> I am sure that the Under-Secretary will tell us that the clause is necessary because clauses 80 to 82 would have no effect without it. It gives the constable in uniform, with or without his hat, the right to board a ship provided that he has reasonable suspicion that he may want to exercise the powers given to him. It says that he ''may use reasonable force'' </p>
<p> and </p>
<p><span class="indent">''may be accompanied by one or more persons.''</span></p>
<p> This may be a good opportunity to ask the Under-Secretary to put our minds at rest by assuring us that if a police officer has the right of entry on every craft, whether privately or commercially owned, the European convention on human rights, if it applies, will not be used to frustrate the Bill, especially clauses 80 to 83. </p>

<p> I have just found something of interest in the explanatory notes, which I hope the Under-Secretary will be able to clarify. Paragraph 90, on page 25, refers to subsection (3)(a) and its reference to ''may use reasonable force''. It states:</p>

<p> If the enforcement measures are to be effective, a police officer must be able to board ship or to enter any other place, as appropriate, to make an arrest or to exercise any of his powers under clause 80&mdash;the powers under the road traffic legislation as modified by the table in that clause. Those powers include requesting a specimen, and are substantially similar to section 6(6) of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</p>
<p> A police officer may use reasonable force and may be accompanied as necessary in exercising the power under this provision. I am informed that there is little difference in practice between ''reasonable force'' and ''by force''. Under our legal system, a police officer always has to act reasonably in such circumstances. </p>

<p> As the Under-Secretary represents a Plymouth constituency, has he ever had occasion to board a vessel that did not wish him to do so? Has he thought about the practicalities of boarding a moving vessel from another moving vessel at sea, and using force in the process?</p>

<p> Thank you, Mr. Hurst. I was deeply tempted by the hon. Lady's comment. I have never</p>
<p> landed on board ship from a helicopter but I have been on a helicopter from which someone was lowered on to a moving vessel, so I know that it is possible. Of course, the Royal Navy has a large presence in my constituency and on occasion it boards vessels off our coast and in other parts of the world to enforce laws. If necessary, it uses reasonable force in the circumstances, and a 16,000 tonne vessel with some large guns on board can use substantial force.</p>
<p> In order effectively to operate the enforcement regime, the police will often require assistance from the appropriate authorities to gain access to vessels, especially while they are at sea within UK territorial waters. We anticipate that sometimes maritime, harbour or inland waterway authorities may need to be involved. Marine officials may accompany the constable in uniform&mdash;for example, when he is being transferred from one vessel to another by helicopter. I accept, as the hon. Member for Vale of York said, that that may be difficult or problematic, and it is not to be done by someone without the appropriate training. </p>
<p> The hon. Lady asked whether powers of entry applied to recreational vessels and the answer is yes, but in the circumstances set out in a previous clause. The explanatory notes make it clear that we are satisfied that the Bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights. Had we not been of that mind, we would not have proceeded. This part of the Bill raises ECHR issues similar to those that apply to drink-drive legislation for roads. We are not aware of any issues that would cast that legislation into doubt. </p>

<p> I am most grateful to the Minister for that clarification; the police must have a right of entry. The nature of boardings was explained to me during my six days on HMS Cumberland; one reason for the Royal Navy being in the Gulf at that time was to police the embargo on Iraq breaking United Nations sanctions and exporting its oil. My question was not about a police officer boarding a ship from a helicopter but about the much more likely scenario of an officer boarding from another vessel at sea and the difficulties involved in trying to move from one to another.</p>
<p> One definitions states that any commissioned naval or military officer is considered for the purposes of section 284 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 as a proper person. In this clause, we are talking about a constable, for whom boarding a ship could be extremely dangerous, and I hope that the Government have taken that on board. It is most helpful to know that recreational craft will be covered. We hope that the Government are right that the European convention on human rights will not have a negative impact and be used as a defence to frustrate the Bill's purposes. </p>

<p> Yes. The provisions in part 4 are intended to overlap with and replace section 117 of the Merchant Shipping Act (1995). Under that section a skipper or seaman on a fishing vessel committed an offence if his capacity to carry out his duties or to fulfil his responsibility for the vessel was impaired through drink or drugs while he was on board. Fishermen are now covered by clause 75 as professional staff when acting in the course of business or employment. I hope that that is helpful to the hon. Lady.</p>

<p> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in</p>
<p><span class="indent">clause 85, page 36, line 20, at end add&mdash; </span></p>
<p> '(7) The organisations consulted in accordance with subsection (6) shall include representatives of the employers, shipowning companies, the British Chamber of Shipping and the Maritime Trade Unions.'.</p>
<p> The amendment is fairly self-explanatory. Clause 85 gives the Secretary of State power to make orders or regulations. There are corresponding provisions in similar clauses for other parts of the Bill. Subsection (6) states that before the Secretary of State makes such regulations he </p>
<p><span class="indent">''shall consult such organisations as he thinks fit''.</span></p>
<p> We would like to make a plea for the organisations consulted to include representatives of the employers, ship-owning companies, the Chamber of Shipping and the maritime trade unions. </p>
<p> Will the Minister confirm that the pilots' associations and the various ports associations&mdash;of which two immediately spring to mind&mdash;will also be consulted? The maritime trade unions, of which the largest and best known is probably NUMAST, would like to be consulted as a matter of course. The Chamber of Shipping and the ship-owning companies and other employers would also expect to be consulted as a matter of course. </p>
<p> We and those organisations believe that too much would be left to the Secretary of State's discretion without the amendment, regardless&mdash;this is not a party political point&mdash;of what Government were in power. It would be incumbent on the Government to expand the number of organisations involved. We could write into the Bill that those bodies would be consulted as of right. </p>

<p> I support the amendment, and I think I know what the Minister is going to say. After sitting</p>
<p> for a while on these Committees, I have got the hang of things: the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said that there was question A and answer B.</p>
<p> Subsection (6) is probably replicated elsewhere in all sorts of Bills. As my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York said, we are not making a party political point, merely flagging up the point. The current Secretary of State is an admirable gentleman and I am sure that he would consult as widely as possible. In today's world, however, it may be wise to specify a little more. It might be that a particular Secretary of State did not want to hear from the employers or the Chamber of Shipping or perhaps even the unions. It is in the interests of all that a wide spectrum of organisations is consulted. It will be welcome if the Under-Secretary can provide sufficient assurances but full consultation in the interests of fairness is necessary. </p>
<p> This is not to cast any aspersions on any particular Secretary of State, past, present or future&mdash;I am sure that many future Secretaries of State are sitting on both sides of the Committee&mdash; </p>

<p> I noted a flutter of reaction from the Opposition side of the Committee when future Secretaries of State were mentioned. Some Opposition Members are quite young, so who knows, all sorts of wonderful things could happen&mdash;perhaps even for the Liberals, but perhaps we should not go into the realms of fantasy.</p>
<p> The Government intend that consultation in respect of any proposal to amend the prescribed alcohol limits will be as wide as possible, and it would certainly include all the organisations mentioned in the amendment. Similarly, if it becomes necessary to prescribe limits for drugs, we would consult widely on producing the necessary equipment&mdash;a portable testing device, for example&mdash;to enable the police to screen for the presence of drugs. </p>
<p> I note that the hon. Member for Uxbridge said that after two and a half weeks of the Bill, he was getting the hang of it. I hope that he will have got the hang of it by next Tuesday morning, when we will have finished. I also noted his comment that the present Secretary of State is admirable; I would go further and say that my right hon. Friend is very admirable. In about an hour's time, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take the opportunity to repeat the point in the House, as the Secretary of State would be delighted to hear it. </p>

<p> I shall take note of that. I would have thought that most of our correspondence is answered efficiently and effectively. If the hon. Gentleman has a particular problem with any correspondence and he informs me about it in the margins of the Committee, I would be pleased to assist him.</p>
<p> The difficulty with the amendment is that the larger the list of organisations to be included in the consultation, the larger becomes the list of those not included. It is already clear that the Secretary of State will consult organisations as he thinks fit. That is tightly defined, and it is replicated elsewhere in the Bill and in other legislation. After that assurance, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment. </p>

<p> Indeed. Some of the orders and regulations are to be made under the negative procedure, but others are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. It would be helpful to know which are which, and which amount to Henry VIII provisions.</p>

<p> Perhaps I can add some clarity for the Committee. Clause 85 deals with the introduction of the secondary legislation on the various matters covered in part 4 of the Bill. Subsection (4) provides that regulations under this part are to be made using the affirmative resolution procedure. That applies to any regulation creating exceptions for non-professionals under clause 77(4) and (5), any regulation amending the prescribed limits under clause 78(2), and any regulation amending the table in clause 80(1) that may be made under clause 80(2). I hope that the hon. Member for Vale of York has followed that, and that I am not going too quickly.</p>
<p> However, clause 85(5) provides that an order by the Secretary of State under clause 81(3)(c) to designate ''marine officials'' with the power to detain a vessel may be made by secondary legislation subject to the negative procedure. Negative procedure is appropriate here because such an order does not create a criminal offence, and the power for a marine official to detain a vessel is conditional on a police constable being requested to attend as soon as possible. Furthermore, the power lapses if the police inform the marine official that they have decided not to take specimens, for whatever reason. I hope that I have clarified the issue of secondary legislation. </p>

<p> In defining different expressions, the clause refers to section 313 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, but that section in full is much greater than the reference in the Bill, in so far as a fishing vessel is defined and deemed to be part of the Bill only in the event that the pilot or crew of the vessel are deemed to have committed an offence&mdash;in particular, the offence of being the cause of an accident, under earlier clauses. We tried, and clearly failed, to define what constitutes a recreational mariner, but the Government have had sufficient time to come up with their own definition. We look forward to hearing what that is.</p>
<p> The most controversial definitions are those of ''United Kingdom ship'' and ''United Kingdom waters''. At the time of the consultation, that was probably the most vexed issue. The marine section of the United Kingdom Pilots Association, whose members could be interpreted as mariners, believes that they could be called upon to act as marine officers for the purposes of this part of the Bill, but they are not included. The association said: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Under those covered by legislation should be added 'including foreign merchant seamen in UK waters'. We consider it should cover UK ships in UK waters and that all crew members should be covered.''</span></p>
<p> I assume that in debating either clause 86 or 88, the Under-Secretary will explain that the Bill will cover all seafarers, merchant shipping and recreational craft. I would hate to think that people on a French yacht might think that we were picking on them because they had had a better lunch than our British yachtsmen, but I assume that the police or marine officer will have the power to board and detain a person on a craft who is accused of an offence under this part of the Bill. That would be helpful. </p>
<p> I note that ''pilot'' has the meaning given under the Pilotage Act 1987. Can the Minister confirm that a pilot could be deemed to be a marine officer for the purposes of the Bill? To clarify the definition of UK ships and UK waters, can the Minister confirm that he intends to extend the jurisdiction to non-British&mdash;that is, foreign&mdash;merchant seamen, fishermen and recreational craft owners? It will be helpful to have the Government's definition of what constitutes a recreational mariner. </p>
<p> The Bill states </p>
<p><span class="indent">'' 'drug' includes any intoxicant other than alcohol.''</span></p>
<p> There will be problems with this definition&mdash;as in earlier clauses&mdash;when testing for certain types of drug. What legislation is the Government drawing on in their definition of a drug? Is it the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 or the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984? </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_13-0_2003-03-04a.14.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" speakername="John Randall" time="10:45" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030304/am/30304s07.htm" colnum="435">
<p> In a discussion on an earlier clause I raised a question about hovercraft that was not addressed. While waiting for the answer, I also thought of amphibious vehicles. There is a commercial tourist operation that sometimes travels around the roads of Westminster and then goes down into the river. In this interpretation, are such vehicles covered by the Road Traffic Act 1998 when they are</p>
<p> on the road and by the Bill when they go into the water? Is that covered in any of the interpretations?</p>
<p> Similarly, I can see that right of entry to a hovercraft is a very different matter from right of entry to an ordinary ship&mdash;with those nasty great propellers going round, and the sealed cabins. I would also like clarification regarding the definition of ''foreign ships'' and ''UK ships''. Does this relate to where the ship is registered, or who the owner is? I am thinking in particular of cross-channel ferries&mdash;or even cross-channel hovercraft, although I think that service has now stopped. </p>
<p> Subsection (5) defines ''drug'' as </p>
<p><span class="indent">''any intoxicant other than alcohol''.</span></p>
<p> Somebody may try and include nicotine in that. Many people would regard the nicotine in cigarettes as a drug with intoxicating effects. The heady effect of a cigarette on someone who is not used to it is well known. </p>

<p> Section 313 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, to which clause 86 refers, was extensive in its coverage and its various interpretations and meanings. It does not as far as I can see cover a recreational mariner, which means any mariner who is not a professional as explained in clause 77(1)(c). The issue would apply to nicotine only if it was impairing someone's ability to carry out navigation functions&mdash;for example a severe bout of coughing.</p>
<p> The hon. Member for Vale of York is right in that the territorial application detailed in clause 88 makes it clear that part 4 extends to foreign and unregistered vessels in UK waters. We might return to that subject in due course. </p>
<p> I can reassure the hon. Member for Uxbridge that hovercraft are covered by section 310 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, and that amphibious vehicles are, as he said, covered by both road traffic and merchant shipping legislation. The hon. Member for Vale of York asked about pilots. According to the definition in 31(1) of the Pilotage Act 1987, a pilot is any person not belonging to a ship who has the conduct thereof. In essence, pilotage is the provision of navigational advice to a master. The pilot does not assume the role of the master, who remains at all times responsible for the navigation and safety of the vessel. The definition of ''drug'' in subsection (5) is similar to that in the Road Traffic Act 1988. We are trying to ensure consistency across legislation for ease of implementation. </p>

<p> The Minister refers to the definitions in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and suggests that they are all very clear. However, I refer him to the explanatory notes to that Act. The notes say that, </p>
<p> although it might be thought that defining ''ship'' was the simplest of tasks, there has been a mass of litigation on whether a particular structure was a ship under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 for a variety of purposes, from marine salvage to the application of safety regulations and tide bars. That is good for lawyers&mdash;I declare an interest. Incidentally, I did not hear the Minister reply to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge made about hovercraft. </p>

<p> I apologise to the Minister.</p>
<p> The notes say that courts have generally taken a rather restrictive view of what is a ship&mdash;I presume that ''a moving object on water'' would be a start&mdash;and that there is particular emphasis on the expression, ''used in navigation.'' They go on to say that the definition of ''ship'' uses the word ''includes'', so that new craft can be recognised as ships. </p>

<p> I am interested in the subject. I have always had a problem with the difference between ships and boats. I wonder whether coracles would count as ships, because they used to sail across the Irish sea.</p>

<p> I should not like to comment on that.</p>
<p> We are told that the 1995 Act does not solve any of the modern problems. However, an anachronism has been removed from the definition of ''ship'' in the 1894 Act. The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Pollution) Act 1994 stated that ''ship'' included every description of a vessel used in navigation not propelled by oars. The present definition removes part of that phrase so that a rowing boat can be a ship. That is important. </p>
<p> On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that the Committee would be told which types of craft were excluded. It would be helpful if the Committee and the industry were told that. I note with regret that we have not been. Presumably, boats in which people train on the Thames for the boat race could be deemed to be boats or ships for these purposes were they to cause an accident of sufficient magnitude that it was an offence under the Bill. I raised the question&mdash;it was not a red herring&mdash;of how pilots were defined and the Minister qualified that definition. He did not say whether pilots would be included in the term ''marine official''. We may wish to return to that point. </p>

<p> I have a minor point to make. So far we have looked at including various items. Here we are considering exclusions. The clause states:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''This Part&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">(a) shall apply, except for section 81, in relation to ships forming part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service''.</span></p>
<p> That is a little messy. Can the Minister explain why the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service is partly in and partly out? The clause says that this part of the Bill does not apply to ships belonging to Her Majesty. Obviously all ships carry her flag. I just wonder which ships belong to her, now that we no longer have the royal yacht Britannia, which I do not think she owned anyway. Other Government ships are excluded. One category particularly concerns us, should there be an accident that led to an offence under the Bill: ships carrying spent nuclear fuels. We understand that waste-carrying ships would be included. Can the Minister confirm that? </p>

<p> The clause applies the prescribed alcohol limits to personnel on ships forming part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service on the basis that those are crewed by civilian personnel who should be treated no differently from other professionals under clause 75. However, in order not to risk impeding the operational efficiency of the Royal Navy, RFAS ships are specifically exempted from clause 81, so that an RFAS vessel will not be subject to the power of detention that may be exercised by marine officials. The likelihood of such a situation arising in practice is thought to be remote.</p>
<p> The hon. Lady asked about vessels carrying nuclear fuels. They are treated as any other vessel in that regard. She also pointed out that the clause excludes Her Majesty's ships&mdash;royal naval vessels&mdash;and other Government ships from the ambit of part 4. Such Government ships form a very small class of vessel in practice. Government ships are defined in section 308 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 as </p>
<p><span class="indent">''ships not forming part of Her Majesty's Navy which belong to Her Majesty, or are held by any person on behalf of or for the benefit of the Crown''.</span></p>
<p> Some Government ships, such as Ministry of Defence yachts, may be crewed by service men, so on balance it is thought best to exclude them along with Royal Navy ships. </p>

<p> The application of the alcohol and drugs provisions to recreational mariners on internal Scottish waters is a devolved matter. However, the Scottish Executive have now confirmed that they wish the proposed offence to apply to Scotland in full. Maritime safety is a vital issue, and the Government are pleased that the Scottish Executive are supporting as a general principle the application of maritime safety rules on a consistent basis throughout the United Kingdom. Clause 88(2), which disapplies clause 77 in relation to Scotland, was drafted before that decision by the Scottish Executive. It is now no longer required, and amendment No. 79 deletes it accordingly.</p>
<p> Amendments Nos. 80 and 81 are technical. They ensure that parts 4 and 5 properly reflect and preserve the existing position under Scottish law. In doing so, they reflect the approach adopted in the Road Traffic Act 1988 relating to alcohol provisions applicable to drivers. Similar provisions in the Transport and Works Act 1992 relate to railways. </p>
<p> Such provisions reflect the Scottish common law powers of entry&mdash;one hesitates to venture into this territory with two Scottish lawyers on the Committee&mdash;for obtaining evidence in the case of car drivers, train drivers and now mariners and aviation personnel who may have committed an alcohol or drug-related offence. Without the amendments, clauses 83 and 95 could conflict with the common law powers available in Scotland. </p>

<p> The Minister said earlier that we would return to this issue. In terms of jurisdiction and the successful application of the Bill, this is an extremely important clause. It will be deemed to have territorial application not only to UK ships, but to all foreign ships in UK waters and un-registered ships. Will the Minister explain what ''un-registered ships'' are? I am not entirely familiar with that</p>
<p> category. I do not know if it refers to ships that are not flagged under a UK register, or ships flagged with no register.</p>
<p> If we are creating a new jurisdiction, presumably it will apply to all categories: fishing vessels, recreational craft such as French, Danish and German yachts coming into UK waters, as well as commercial vessels. Are there corresponding jurisdictions whereby our ships face similar provisions in other EU states, for example, or is the International Maritime Organisation considering making international provisions that are similar to those that the Bill will impose? If the pilot, officers or crew of an oil tanker caused an accident that was deemed to be an offence under the Bill, it would have consequences beyond our shores, as there may be serious pollution that had ramifications in other countries. </p>
<p> The Minister explained why Scotland is being treated differently, but I should be grateful if he repeated the arguments to put my mind at rest in relation to recreational mariners in Scotland. For those who do not mind wind at sea and fairly heavy waters, a sailing holiday, especially navigating around the west coast of Scotland and the east coast is an enjoyable experience that is growing in popularity. Clauses 77 and 83 should apply in Scotland, or the Minister should give reasons why they should not. My concern is that the territorial application, the jurisdiction that is being extended, should be practicable. It was put to the Government in forceful terms on consultation that the proposal should apply to all ships and we seek the Minister's confirmation that that will be so. </p>

<p> I am delighted that the Government amendment was accepted because it saves my asking questions about Scottish waters and boundaries. When I introduced a private Member's Bill, the boundaries between English and Scottish waters were still disputed, but the matter is resolved in the amendment.</p>
<p> United Kingdom waters can mean different things to different people. The jurisdictions of marine law are very complicated and any ongoing disputes may have an impact on the Bill. I should be grateful for the Minister's assurance in that respect. I should also be grateful if he confirmed that United Kingdom waters do not include waters off Crown dependencies such as Gibraltar and St. Helena. </p>
<p> My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York referred earlier to hot pursuit, which makes it sound more exciting than it may be. However, at sea it is difficult to ascertain the precise location of a vessel in respect of territorial waters. The territorial application referred to is not where the alleged offence was committed, but where the ship is when the constable tries to board it. The Bill covers United Kingdom ships wherever they are, but presumably our jurisdiction over a foreign ship would end if it were outside territorial waters. How would that be ascertained? Will it be an offence or breach an international agreement if officers go after a person who is alleged to have committed an offence in our territorial waters but who at the time of apprehension is outside them, even </p>
<p> though our officers have the right to go after the person involved? I should be grateful if the Minister elucidated on those matters. </p>

<p> We dealt with the questions about Scotland raised by the hon. Member for Vale of York in the debate on amendment No. 79. It is common for legislation to apply to foreign vessels in UK waters, in the same way as road legislation applies to foreign vehicles on British roads.</p>
<p> Unregistered ships are those that are not registered under part 2 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. That definition will therefore cover smaller vessels such as recreational vessels and pleasure craft. </p>
<p> The definition of UK waters is contained in section 313 of the Merchant Shipping Act, and covers </p>
<p><span class="indent">''the sea or other waters within the seaward limits of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom.''</span></p>
<p> That covers all UK national internal and territorial waters to the 12-mile limit. </p>
<p> The police jurisdiction extends to the 12-mile limit, and the police would only be able to pursue action outside that limit with the co-operation of other countries. The hon. Member for Uxbridge may have explored that issue when he tabled his private Member's Bill. </p>
<p> I believe the clause to be straightforward, and commend it to the Committee. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I would like to raise the issue of whether other jurisdictions or the International Maritime Organisation seek to introduce similar legislation. The Opposition welcome the provisions. We sought to introduce similar provisions and would have done so, had the change of Government in 1997 not stopped us in our tracks. Is there any indication that the IMO or the European Union are seeking to introduce similar provisions? Clearly, it would be a problem if a shipping disaster caused by alcohol or drug intoxication happened in their waters, just as it would be a problem if a foreign tanker caused an</p>
<p> accident arising from an offence provided for under the Bill.</p>

<p> I understand that there are no international plans for legislation, but many countries have their own laws. I indicated that taking action beyond the 12-mile limit would be possible only with the co-operation of other countries. I presume that such action would be with the co-operation and assistance of the countries in which the vessel is registered, which is in accordance with the international law of the sea.</p>

<p> I welcome the provisions in this part of the Bill. I am delighted that we have made such progress that we have reached the provisions relating to aviation, alcohol and drugs.

<p> Will the Minister take the opportunity to define further the phrase ''unfit for duty''? There is concern in the industry, which I am sure will have been expressed to his Department, about the definition of that phrase and, more especially, about when testing takes place to prove that a person is unfit for duty.
