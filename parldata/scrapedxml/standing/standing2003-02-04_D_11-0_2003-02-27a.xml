<p> It is a great pleasure to see members of the Committee reassembled, and I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Hood.</p>
<p> The Police Act 1996 has been on the statute book for some considerable time, and I wish to put some questions to the Minister of State. He will agree that the Bill and the 1996 Act apply to offences against police officers, but do they also relate to a person who comes to the aid of a police officer, or is that covered by a separate offence? We obviously want to encourage civilians to assist the British Transport police in cases of hot pursuit. </p>
<p> The 1996 Act deals with a person who assaults a policeman in the exercise of his duty or, indeed, a person who assists a constable, so the answer is already there and we can move on. A person found guilty of an offence in that case shall be liable on conviction to a term of six months or more. That serious offence has been on the statute book since 1964. </p>
<p> Have any incidents relating to the British Transport police been a cause of concern? That is especially important in view of the new powers given to the British Transport police by the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the increasing security problems that our country faces. </p>
<p> Other provisions relate to the equally serious crime of impersonation of a police officer. Under section 90(1) of the 1996 Act: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Any person who with intent to deceive impersonates a member of a police force or special constable, or makes any statement or does any act calculated falsely to suggest that he is such a member or constable, shall be guilty of an offence''.</span></p>
<p> Clause 65 of the Bill refers to section 90 of the 1996 Act, which raises the question why special constables are not specifically mentioned. One would hope that the offence of an assault on a constable or any person assisting or seeking to assist a constable would by definition include special constables and cadets in the British Transport police. Now is a good opportunity to ask about that. </p>
<p> How many offences have there been against the British Transport police in respect of impersonating and assaulting a police officer in performance of his duty? Clearly, sections 89 and 90 of the 1996 Act also take effect in Scotland. It would be interesting to hear a breakdown of the incidence of those two offences </p>
<p> against British Transport police officers to see whether it is higher or lower in Scotland than in England and Wales. </p>
<p> The clause appears straightforward. I hope that wasting police time will also be regarded as an offence. Are the offences the same as in the 1996 Act, or are they by implication to be read through the clause? We support the clause, but we should be interested to know the incidence of the offences and the implications of the new police powers under the 2001 Act. In particular, we should like to know why the special constables are referred to in section 90 of the 1996 Act but not in section 89. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.4.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1242" speakername="John Spellar" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Transport"  time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s01.htm" colnum="332">
<p> The purpose of the clause is to harmonise procedures wherever possible. Under the Police Act 1996, which extends only to England and Wales, it is an offence to impersonate or to assault a police constable. The clause confirms that it is an offence to assault both full-time and special British Transport police constables, and that that is the case in England and Wales and in Scotland. The hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) asked how many assaults resulted in cases for British Police constables. There were 260 cases in 2000&ndash;01 and 258 in 2001&ndash;02. In Scotland, there were 49 cases in 2000&ndash;01 and 49 in 2001&ndash;02. Fortunately, the numbers are not rising but they are still far too high. Obviously we deplore that and are taking whatever action we can to reduce them.</p>
<p> The offence of impersonating a constable was extended to the British Transport police by the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. The clause confirms that it is an offence to impersonate a British Transport police officer and that that is the case throughout Great Britain, as opposed to just in England and Wales. The hon. Lady rightly points out that the clause is slightly narrower than section 89 of the Police Act 1996 in that it does not make it an offence to assault a person assisting a British Transport police constable, although the offence of assault would still apply. I do not know whether the hon. Lady wants to press the matter. We may need to give it further consideration. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.4.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="8:55" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s01.htm" colnum="332">
<p> I am grateful to the Minister for those helpful comments. My concern is that we must take this opportunity to give the British Transport police the powers and the confidence that they need to do their job. Perhaps not making the offence a similar one is simply a drafting error. As someone who is not terribly large, I would be put off going to the assistance of a British Police constable if I knew that the would-be assailant could be prosecuted for assaulting a British Transport police constable but not for assaulting me. We will wish to return to this matter. Will the Minister tell us the philosophy behind the proposal? Has there been a deliberate omission or merely a drafting error?</p>
<p> I am confused about why the offence in clause 89 relates only to England and Wales, when a similar offence pertains in Scotland for regular constables. I hope that the Bill will contain an offence of assault on a constable of the British Transport police in the execution of his duty, with the corollary that there </p>
<p> should be a similar offence in respect of anyone coming to the assistance of that constable in Scotland, too. </p>
<p> I am told that mens rea&mdash;the mental element required to prove that a person was wilfully and deliberately committing an offence, which goes to the heart of a successful prosecution&mdash;applies in clause 89 and, presumably, in clause 90, too. </p>
<p> On the matter of football offences, the Liberal Democrats are wedded to vandalism, but we want to consider hooliganism in connection with football matches. In view of the figures that the Minister quoted earlier, it could be difficult to prove mens rea in the case of a football supporter&mdash;I hesitate to say a drunken supporter&mdash;who has had more than a few alcoholic drinks on the day of a football match. Nevertheless, we are told that the accused's reasonable and honest ignorance of a constable's status will entitle acquittal, which would put the constable in a difficult position. </p>
<p> Were the figures quoted by the Minister for offences committed or for those that were successfully prosecuted? It would be in our interests to take this opportunity to tighten up the provisions and remove the need for mens rea. </p>
<p> I listened with great care to the Minister but did not hear him say that special constables are included in section 89 of the 1996 Act and, by implication, in clause 65. The section does not refer to special constables. However, section 90 of the 1996 Act refers to the impersonation of a member of the police force or a special constable. </p>
<p> I appreciate that in most circumstances British Transport police are not issued with a firearm, but by virtue of firearm legislation, it is an offence for a person to make, or to attempt to make, any use of a firearm or imitation firearm with intent to resist or prevent the lawful arrest or detention of himself or another. Although it is not in the Bill, I hope that it will continue by implication to be an offence. </p>
<p> We have not considered the offence of corruptly offering or agreeing to give any inducement or reward to a constable for doing or forbearing to do any act or showing or forbearing to favour or disfavour any person in connection with the discharge of the constable's responsibilities, or the knowingly giving of any receipt or other document containing a statement that is false or any material particular to a constable with the intent to deceive, which is likely to constitute an offence. Hon. Members will be aware that that offence dates back to the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906. Will the Minister confirm that it will continue to be an offence under the new provisions? Is there an omission or a drafting error? I would prefer the provision to extend to specials. </p>
<p> There was also a specific reference to Scotland. Section 89(3) of the 1996 Act states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''This section also applies to a constable who is a member of a police force maintained in Scotland or Northern Ireland when he is executing a warrant, or otherwise acting in England or Wales, by </span></p>
<p><span class="indent">virtue of any enactment conferring powers on him in England and Wales.''</span></p>
<p> Why does it not state that that section applies in Scotland? Is there a separate Act for Scotland? I cannot find one. </p>
<p> Have the Government given any thought to removing the need for mens rea? I believe that it weakens the offence whereby reasonable and honest ignorance of the constable's status on the part of the accused will entitle him to acquittal. To put it crudely, if an offender is blind drunk and says that he thought that he was assaulting a hospital porter, that might lead to a separate charge of a common or other assault under a different statute, but it should not lead to acquittal under the new provisions. I hope that the Government might seek to reverse that. </p>

<p> If we have much more of this, the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) will not only be awaiting his call-up papers to go to the middle east, but will be nipping down to Portsmouth to demand to be admitted.</p>
<p> The question of football supporters is a touchy one for Liberal Democrats. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) will recall that one of his colleagues lost his seat by falling out with football supporters who ran a fringe candidate whose votes exceeded the majority of the successful Conservative Member. </p>

<p> I cannot possibly comment on the motivation of Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p> I shall clarify several points raised by the hon. Member for Vale of York, which she could have ascertained for herself from reading the Bill. On the Bill's application to Scotland, I refer the hon. Lady to clause 65(3), which states: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''In their application in relation to the Police Force by virtue of this section, sections 89 and 90 of that Act shall have effect throughout England and Wales and Scotland.''</span></p>
<p> On special constables, clause 24(5), which we already discussed, states that ''constable'' includes special constables. That ensures that they are covered. </p>
<p> I can also inform the hon. Lady that the British Transport police will continue to be covered by existing offences that apply to the force, such as bribery and firearms. She asked about the figures that I gave on assaults. I understand that those are the figures for offences committed. </p>
<p> I also understand that mens rea&mdash;the mental element&mdash;does not extend to whether someone knew that the person was a constable. What matters is the fact that the person is a constable. Having indicated to the hon. Lady that we will consider the question of assault on a person assisting a constable, I commend the clause to the Committee. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.4.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="9:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s02.htm" colnum="335">
<p> That is all very interesting&mdash;particularly what we learned about the Liberal Democrat agent, although I will leave that point with the hon. Member for Bath.</p>
<p> I specifically asked whether there had been a drafting error, and the Minister has been good enough to say that the Government will return to that. However, as the Government have already tabled a number of amendments, they had the opportunity to table an amendment on that issue. We would like to see a reference to assault on a person assisting a constable included in the Bill, and will consider returning to the matter later. </p>
<p> I heard what the Minister said about special constables. However, whereas section 90 of the Police Act 1996 refers to a police constable and a special constable for the purpose of the offence of impersonation, section 89 does not specify that a special constable is also included. I am trying to be helpful to the Minister, because I believe that any bright lawyer would be able to poke a number of holes in the Bill, because of earlier references to a special constable. If the Government are satisfied with the drafting and want to put it to the test in the courts, then so be it. However, this might have been an opportunity for the Government to clarify that. </p>
<p> I understand what the Minister said about mens rea, but we in the 1981 case of Annan v. Tait in the Scottish courts&mdash;I am sure that there has been a similar case in the English courts&mdash;it was said that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a reasonable and honest belief in the ignorance of the constable's status as a constable by the accused will entitle an acquittal.''</span></p>
<p> I believe that that weakens the whole purpose of the provision on assault. As I said at the outset, we should at the earliest opportunity include a reference to anyone coming to help a British Transport police constable or a special constable in the course of their duties. </p>
<p> Question put and agreed to. </p>
<p> Clause 65 ordered to stand part of the Bill. </p>

<p> How do the responsibilities of the British Transport police relate to the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988? I would have thought that the main responsibilities of the British Transport police related to railways and the underground.</p>

<p> The provision is primarily to enable the British Transport police to deal more effectively with routine motoring offences, and particularly those committed at level crossings.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.6.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="9:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s02.htm" colnum="335">
<p> That is helpful. That raises the question of what proportion of their time the British</p>
<p> Transport police spend on traffic duties and what proportion on general duties. Obviously the imposition of fines on people at level crossings falls rightfully within their purview. I could imagine a situation in which they might be asked, if they were close to the scene of an incident, to assist the regular traffic police. What proportion of their time does that involve?</p>
<p> Incidentally, I was delighted to find in the Library that Wilkinson is still the authority on road traffic offences. It has been the leading authority for some considerable time. I simply want to use this little debate to ask not only about the interrelationship with level crossings, but about the role of the British Transport police in wider traffic duties and the proportion of its time that it spends on such duties. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.6.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1242" speakername="John Spellar" time="9:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s02.htm" colnum="336">
<p> That does not take a great part of the British Transport police's time, but the BTP is concerned about level crossings and, in particular, deterring motorists from committing offences. In 2001&ndash;02, there were 27 recorded train incidents at level crossings and three fatalities when trains struck road vehicles. There are some 8,100 level crossings on the national rail network, and 725 of them are in Scotland.</p>
<p> In early 2000, Network Rail in Scotland, together with the BTP, introduced red light enforcement cameras at eight level crossings. One crossing camera alone was activated 1,191 times in the 15 months after it was installed. Some 83 per cent. of camera activations have resulted in prosecutions. The good news is that there has been a rapid decrease in the initially high figure for the number of activations at that site. Other areas in the vicinity of stations are also covered by cameras. </p>
<p> The prime purpose of the clause is to enable the BTP and to regularise its position with regard to the level crossings that provide the interface between the road network and the rail network, for which the BTP is responsible. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.6.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="9:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s02.htm" colnum="336">
<p> That was a staggeringly high number. The Minister used the expression ''in the vicinity of ''. My understanding was that that was used generally, so we tried to write it into the Bill, but the Government were not minded to allow that. Is the Minister saying that by implication there is a common law acceptance that ''in the vicinity of'' will remain?</p>
<p> The Selby rail crash involved a huge amount of police resources from the North Yorkshire force. In that incident, a Land Rover came off the road at a bridge and crashed on to the line in the path of an oncoming train, causing devastation. I understand that for the most part it was the regular North Yorkshire police who were involved in the investigation, but I should have thought that there was a specific call to involve the British Transport police as well. </p>
<p> What is the relationship between two forces in such circumstances? Am I correct in assuming that the local force would take the lead in bringing a prosecution? That is slightly bizarre, because although the Selby incident involved a road vehicle, the devastation was caused on the rail track. Obviously, it was a train on </p>
<p> the track that caused all the fatalities and the huge number of injuries. I imagine that that would have been an opportunity for the British Transport police to take the lead. In normal circumstances, what would be the relationship between the British Transport police and the local police? </p>

<p> Under the clause, the authority is given a discretionary power to provide advice or assistance or to arrange for the British Transport police to provide advice or assistance to a body that has responsibilities in relation to the policing of a railway outside Great Britain. We discussed the policing of Eurotunnel. I wondered in the event of a major incident whether they would be seconded as provided for under clause 67(2) or whether they would be invited to assist for a short time.</p>
<p> My understanding is that secondment would be for a matter of months; three months, six months or more. But if there were a major incident&mdash;God forbid&mdash;in Eurotunnel&mdash;[Interruption.] I keep saying Eurotunnel, but I mean the channel tunnel. Having shares in Eurotunnel, one grows blinkered and hopes that it will do better, although it has done quite well recently. </p>
<p> I refer to the British Transport police being called to help with an incident in the channel tunnel. Would that be for a short period of time or for a longer period, such as a secondment? If it were a secondment, would British Transport police officers continue to be paid out of their funds or would they be paid by those to whom they were seconded? </p>
<p> Since the treaty on European Union was signed at Maastricht in February 1992, with the close co-operation of European member states on justice and home affairs, there is now much greater provision for police to co-operate with each other. That is done formally through the EU-wide system of exchanging information within the European Police Office, known as Europol. I am not completely up to date on this point; will the Minister say where Europol's office is based? I thought it was going to have an office in Strasbourg, but I am not sure whether that came about and whether we have reached the right stage in the Bill for me to ask. </p>
<p> As it is now 11 years since that co-operation agreement was signed in the treaty of European Union, it would be of great assistance to us to know </p>
<p> the extent to which we are formally co-operating. The TREVI group was the forerunner of Europol. </p>
<p> When I was a Member of the European Parliament I invited a group of Essex police officers to Brussels for a briefing from the internal officers of the Commission. I am playing for time to help the Minister find the information I asked for. Among the officers was a very nice gentleman, the head of the Criminal Investigation Department in the Essex force, whose name was Mr. Crook&mdash;obviously, it was easy to remember. To my chagrin&mdash;it was the first time it had ever happened&mdash;he had his rather nice Italian raincoat stolen while we were in the restaurant of the European Parliament building. They went on a tour to see the red light district of Brussels, on which I accompanied them out of my own interest. They then went on to the red light district of Holland to see how the different&mdash; </p>

<p> That brings me right back to saying that if the TREVI group was the forerunner and if Europol now exists, I need to know where its office is, when it was set up, what is the existing relationship of the British Transport police to Europol and what it is intended to be under clause 67. I am aware that there are vice squads in other national police forces elsewhere in the European Union. The Opposition side of the Committee would also be interested to know whether Europol co-operates with the equivalent of the British Transport police. How many other European countries have special police forces?</p>
<p> I understand that member states are under a duty to co-ordinate action by collaborating through relevant Departments&mdash;presumably the Home Office and the Department for Transport. Will the Minister confirm that, for the purposes of clause 67, the Secretary of State for Transport is responsible for co-ordination? Will the co-operation envisaged in the clause take the form of emergency scenarios, such as the resilience policy developed by the civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office? It would be useful to have annually or every second year some such incident&mdash;and perhaps you, Mr. Hood, could be the VIP to volunteer. Is that the sort of co-operation envisaged? </p>
<p> Will the Minister confirm that member states agreed to examine measures designed to enhance co-operation and, if so, what specific measures? I understand that providing support for national criminal investigations, the creation of databases, the development of central analysis, the assessment of information, the furthering of training and research, forensic matters and criminal records are all envisaged. To what extent is it already happening and to what extent will the clause develop it further? </p>
<p> Will the Minister explain the position regarding hot pursuit? If the British Transport police are chasing a person accused of a serious crime and that person boards a Eurostar train or a car travelling through the Channel tunnel to another EU country, does the clause grant the police the right to hot pursuit under the Maastricht treaty, or would they have to cease </p>
<p> their jurisdiction and rely on other forces? I had hoped that Europol's provisions and those of the Maastricht treaty would allow hot pursuit. Equally, what is the corollary responsibility of the British Transport police's equivalent? Will French police come in hot pursuit of their accused in the other direction or the Belgian police board a ferry to come over here? Will the Minister clarify how far the co-operation already in force under the Maastricht treaty will be furthered by clause 67? </p>
<p> The most alarming development for policing with the greatest potential negative impact is the European convention on human rights. That convention was written into the Human Rights Act 1998, so it would be interesting to know how often evidence has been prevented from coming before the courts or the privacy of an individual prevented from being invaded. Do the Government envisage pooling their collective knowledge and experience under the European convention on human rights? Could it have a negative impact on policing with their European counterparts? I understand that the arrest or detention of individuals is regulated by article 5 of the convention, although that does not affect short periods of detention in order to permit the questioning of suspects, which do not fall within the scope of the guarantee in that article. </p>
<p> The Minister might like to comment on the fact that for deprivation of liberty to be lawful, it must be prescribed by domestic law, which it now is, and to fall in one of the six categories listed. We have serious reservations about the impact of the Human Rights Act on policing in this country. Has the Minister had any opportunity to discuss with his ministerial counterparts the impact that that Act will have on the British Transport police? That knowledge would be most useful if, for example, other police forces or an inspector of an equivalent investigative branch are prevented from entering a private dwelling of an individual to take evidence. It would be interesting to know how often article 5 has been used in this country and in others. </p>
<p> We broadly welcome the opportunities to provide international assistance, but want to know how the clause can facilitate that and to hear how wedded the Government are to that concept, given that it is 13 years since the Maastricht treaty came into effect. We also want to record our concern that the implications of article 5 could have a negative impact on policing. Has the police's mind been put at rest by talking to their opposite numbers in other European countries? </p>

<p> I wondered when the Conservative Opposition would get around to discussing Europe. One can take a Member out of Europe, but one cannot take Europe out of the Member. The hon. Lady's remarks were all very interesting, but have nothing to do with the clause, which relates to the ability of the British Transport police to provide advice and assistance to a body that has responsibilities for the policing of the railway outside the United Kingdom. It provides the mechanism by which that can happen, and deals with the funding that relates to that. The Police Act 1996, to which we continually refer, also</p>
<p> allows Home Office police forces to provide assistance to overseas police forces. As hon. Members will know, that advice and assistance is usually co-ordinated by the Foreign Office when nations are in urgent need of them. In a previous incarnation as the Minister for the Armed Forces, I worked with the Ministry of Defence police and several other police forces to help to stabilise the situation in Kosovo. Central Government funding is often available in certain circumstances.</p>

<p> It is a nicety. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the provisions do not apply in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p> The funding of seconded BTP officers will be a matter for the BTP authority and receiving police force. Subsection (2)(b) allows for payment arrangements as agreed. The hon. Lady made a sensible point about whether an immediate incident in the channel tunnel would involve secondment. It would not, but it might well be sensible to have a secondment for a longer term investigation after the appropriate bodies that govern the channel tunnel had decided on jurisdiction. </p>
<p> On the other matters raised about extradition, hot pursuit and so on, the general provisions that apply to all police forces will apply. Nothing in the clause changes that; it deals only with administrative arrangements to provide welcome assistance to other police forces when required. </p>

<p> That is all very interesting, but the Minister's dismissal of my points is not a proper reflection of his ability. If he and his Department do not know where Europol is based, why does he not admit that? That question clearly relates to international assistance. An international co-operation agreement was signed under the 1992 Maastricht treaty, and it is proper for us to question the Minister about that. If he were humble and honest enough to say that he does not know but that he will drop me a line for my interest, that would be fine. However, it is wrong to dismiss the point as irrelevant when it is clearly relevant. The legal base for the co-operation has moved on. As I explained, the United Kingdom will be under a duty, and the Minister may be the lead Minister. We want to know how many other European countries have transport police forces with which it would be in our interests to liaise. Is Europol up and running and if not, why not? Is that because the British Government will not co-operate or provide the resources to do its job? We demand an answer.</p>
<p> The Minister referred to the application of the clause. It seems to involve the railway police outside Great Britain, so does that include Northern Ireland? What is the relationship of clause 67 with Northern Ireland? I omitted to ask that earlier in my excitement about the theme. Furthermore, will the discretionary power have to be approved by an affirmative consent of the Secretary of State? That is how I read clause </p>
<p> 67(3); I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that. </p>
<p> If the Minister does not know the answers to my questions on Europol, we would accept a little letter from him. However, the Opposition would take a serious view if he just dismissed the questions as irrelevant. I repeat for the record that we shall monitor carefully how article 5 of the European convention on human rights, provided for in the Human Rights Act 1998, will be applied, particularly with regard to earlier clauses. </p>

<p> I wish to pull together several strands that relate to part 3 on the British Transport police. Many representations have been made to us&mdash;I cannot believe that they have not been made to the Government&mdash;and we share the concerns expressed in them. We would deplore any centralisation of control to Government in the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers in clause 68. The British Transport police should operate with full autonomy as far as possible. Clauses 55, 48, 40 and 33 offer the Secretary of State a whole raft of opportunities to be a little heavier handed than his predecessors.</p>
<p> My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) pointed out that this is the first time that the Department for Transport will assume responsibilities in this regard. We now have a more concentrated Department focusing exclusively on transport issues. That is welcome. We just want to put down a marker that it should be for the British Transport police primarily to determine the most efficient and effective way for them to operate. They obviously work under the auspices of the British Transport police authority. They will be paid by the industry and as we have seen there will be extensive consultation between members of the authority, the police and other interested parties. The British Transport police feel very strongly, as do the Royal National Institute of the Blind and a number of other organisations that have made forceful representations, about the exercise of the functions of the Secretary of State. I hope that the Under-Secretary can reassure us that the Secretary of State and the Department do not intend to micromanage the British Transport police. </p>
<p> We record again, for the sake of clarity, our deep appreciation of the work of the British Transport </p>
<p> police as a whole and its individual officers, constables, specials and cadets. We cannot pay them enough tribute. They work in very difficult circumstances for a lot of the time and see some horrendous incidents and crimes. I hope that the Under-Secretary will take the opportunity yet again to confirm that the Department and the Secretary of State will take a light touch in this regard. </p>
<p> I am still a little concerned how the Department will assume that role when the Bill comes into force, bearing in mind that it does not intend to appoint any new members of staff but will simply redistribute the responsibilities around its excellent officials. It would help to know how it will be structured and how it will organise itself in this regard. Unlike some Departments, it is still not the most transparent of bodies. It is significant that we will have an annual railways policing plan, a three-year strategy plan and annual reports by the chief constable and the British Transport police authority. We stress our concern that the Secretary of State's ability to set performance targets might contradict the efficiency and effectiveness of the authority in exercising its duty. We wait with great interest to hear whether the Under-Secretary can put our minds at rest. </p>

<p> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving me this opportunity to explain briefly one or two matters relevant to the clause. The Bill provides the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions with a number of functions and duties regarding the British Transport police, the proposed authority and the policing of the railways.</p>
<p> The clause places a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to exercise these functions, </p>
<p><span class="indent">''for the purpose of promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the Police Force''.</span></p>
<p> As we found in our previous deliberations, it is equivalent to section 36 of the Police Act 1996, which places the same requirement on the Home Secretary regarding local police forces. I assure the hon. Lady that this is not about centralisation or micromanagement of the British Transport police. I do not know whether she has noticed, but the Department has one or two other matters to attend to from time to time. There is no ambition to be involved in more detail than necessary with the British Transport police. </p>
<p> The clause merely provides that where the Secretary of State has a function in part 3, he must use it to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the British Transport police. That could be done in a number of ways: by the appointment of members; supporting the authority outside and so on. All the Secretary of State's powers regarding the British Transport police either exist already&mdash;for example, the arbitration under clause 33&mdash;or are modelled on the powers that the Home Secretary has for local police forces&mdash;for example, clause 48 is modelled on section 37 of the Police Act 1996. </p>
<p> For the avoidance of doubt, the Department has been responsible for the British Transport police for </p>
<p> many years, so this will not be an entirely new function for the Department. The hon. Lady also alluded to the annual plans and reports and the three-year strategy; all those already happen. I hope with that explanation we can move to the vote on the clause. </p>

<p> That is all very interesting. The Under-Secretary will be aware that under section 36 of the 1996 Act there is no residual power for the Secretary of State to take over the running of a police force that is failing in its duties. However, it establishes a general duty on the Secretary of State to exercise his powers in a manner to promote efficiency and effectiveness. I do not envisage it being the case, but if the British Transport police ever reached a stage where they were deemed to be failing in their duties, what would the Department's reaction be? What are its powers under existing legislation and is it envisaged that it would ever take on an increased role?</p>
<p> I am slightly disappointed by the Under-Secretary's reaction to the serious representations made throughout the responses to the consultation paper on this part of the Bill, which related to the policing aspect alone. The theme in those responses was that while those duties have already been exercised hitherto, as the Under-Secretary explained, the Bill goes much further. We have analysed individual clauses where that is the case, given the Secretary of State's new potential powers for centralising. The representations that we have read and have some sympathy with arise from alarm bells ringing among organisations, but they appear to have fallen on deaf ears. How does the Under-Secretary respond to those concerns? </p>

<p> I have nothing more to add to the debate. The procedures are well set out and we have clearly explained the purpose of the clause. Clauses 62 and 63 allow the Secretary of State to require remedial action and to make action plans, if required. Our debates in earlier sittings comprehensively covered the necessary procedure should there be any failure of the British Transport police.</p>

<p> How long will the transitional period be for provisions to be made under the clause? Subsection (3) states:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''Transitional provision . . . may, in particular, make provision in connection with the abolition of the police force comprising constables appointed under section 53 of the British Transport Commission Act 1949''.</span></p>
<p> Presumably, those provisions are no longer applicable. I thank the Under-Secretary for his note setting out the definitions of the bodies concerned for the purposes of the Bill, which was very helpful in preparing for the Committee stage. Before the Bill goes to the other place, I urge the hon. Gentleman to make a declaration of the relationship between the Strategic Rail Authority and the other bodies. </p>
<p> Subsection (3) states that </p>
<p><span class="indent">''provision may include, in particular, provision&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">(b) for the transfer to the Authority of property held (whether by the Strategic Rail Authority or by another person)''.</span></p>
<p> Could that be Network Rail? Does that apply purely to the old transport police or is it intended to apply in respect of the new framework that the Bill sets up for the British Transport police? </p>
<p> Paragraph 25 of schedule 7 to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which itself amends section 90 of the Police Act 1996, will cease to have effect, although it has been in force for less than two years. Will the Minister explain the impact of the proposal? </p>
<p> We have expressed concern in debates on this part and throughout the proceedings on parts 1 and 2 about the inter-relationship between the various bodies. It would have been opportune to have a schedule, rather than relying on protocols and framework agreements, which are made outside the confines of the Bill. It would have been helpful for all concerned&mdash;members of the Committee, the industry and partners and parties involved&mdash;if the relationship </p>
<p> between the bodies and the framework agreements had been set out in the Bill. </p>

<p> I have a couple of questions, but first I want to say that as there has been much legal talk in the debate I am pleased that the simple phrase ''the old transport police'' will be understood by lay people.</p>
<p> Subsection (3) states that the provision ''may'' include certain worthy things&mdash;employment to be treated as continuous and so on&mdash;and provision for dealing with </p>
<p><span class="indent">''(i) the termination of agreements made in respect of the old transport police;</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">(ii) the treatment of rights and liabilities''.</span></p>
<p> I am slightly worried about the word ''may'' in that respect, which might allow some of the rights and liabilities, which include important matters such as employment being treated as continuous and so on, to be negated at a later stage. Presumably, the Minister will assure the Committee that all rights and liabilities under the old transport police shall be transferred to the new body. </p>

<p> The Bill will place the British Transport police on a proper statutory footing by establishing a police authority to maintain the force. As part of the process, the role of employer of the force will transfer to the authority, which will also undertake the statutory functions currently undertaken by the British Transport police committee and the Strategic Rail Authority in respect of the force.</p>
<p> In reply to the hon. Member for Vale of York, as part of the process it will be necessary to transport the British Transport Police constables, civilian staff and property liabilities to the authority, and clause 70 will allow that process to be undertaken by statutory instrument. It also makes provision for other references on the statute book to the Strategic Rail Authority and the British Transport police committee to be amended by order as a consequence of the Bill, so that in future the reference is to the British Transport police authority. </p>
<p> The consequential powers are to make provision by order to deal with the changes needed to legislation as a consequence of the Bill. Those are set out. The hon. Lady asked how long the transition process would take. It could take up to two years; no definite period has been fixed. It depends on how long the changes take. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for Uxbridge asked about the phrase ''may include''. I anticipate that most of the matters listed would almost certainly be included. For example, clause 70(3)(k) refers to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''the continuity of legal proceedings''.</span></p>
<p> However, if there were no legal proceedings, such continuity would not be needed. Those matters may be included if that is appropriate. </p>

<p> That was very interesting. My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge also raised, as I did, the reference to ''the old transport police''. I repeat that reassurance is needed that the old transport police</p>
<p> have gone and we are dealing with the new transport police.</p>
<p> The Minister seemed reluctant to rely on the excellent explanatory notes, to which we often refer. These state: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Clause 70 includes powers under subsections (3)(e) to (g), to make transitional provision to a relevant pension scheme to ensure continuity following the establishment of the Authority, whilst recognising the direct relationship between the new Authority and the Secretary of State. For example, subsection (3)(g) would enable modifications to be made to the procedural or structural arrangements of staff pension schemes (excluding benefit/contribution/funding structures) as a consequence of the new relationship. Subsection (3)(f) would enable existing enactments about pension schemes to have immediate effect, e.g. to apply the provisions of Section 16 of the 1995 Pensions Act covering pension members' rights to select trustees.''</span></p>
<p> There we have it. </p>
<p> We are told that the proposals in the Bill could have a significant adverse effect on the pension rights of members of the British Transport police superannuation fund, because of the following. It is proposed that the railways pension trustee company will no longer be the trustee. We should like to know why that is the case. In introducing clause 70, the Under-Secretary indicated that it was an innocent little clause that just gave effect to the setting up of the British Transport police force on a statutory basis. Why are the Government doing that at this time? Why are they introducing that change to the pension scheme? That does not seem to enjoy the support of the British Transport police. Does it mean that the British Transport police will or will not remain with that provider of pension schemes? As I have asked, why will the railways pension trustee company no longer be the trustee? </p>
<p> We understand that there will be an impact on the current investment arrangements, which are part of the pooled fund for investment purposes. It is not certain whether the British Transport police could remain with that. I also understand that the proposal would probably lead to significantly increased costs. That raises a second question. First, why make the change at all? Secondly, why make it if it will lead to increased costs? </p>
<p> Clearly, many pension schemes and many superannuated pension contributors are currently in turmoil. We are a special case. It is incumbent on us to show an interest in the plight of others who do not enjoy the privileged position that we in the House enjoy&mdash;although we do not necessarily have security of tenure in our positions. I repeat: why will the railways pension trustee company no longer be a trustee, and why will that lead to a significant increase in costs? </p>
<p> Clause 70 proposes that the Secretary of State would need to consent to changes to the scheme with reference to general police officers' pension benefits. The British Transport police scheme is funded and therefore totally different from the Home Office police scheme&mdash;I presume that the Under-Secretary is aware of that. Improvements in the scheme have traditionally been made without reference to the Home Office scheme, so why is the decoupling happening and would that be curtailed by the Secretary of State? </p>
<p> Pension arrangements for the administration of staff effectively remain unchanged. I am sure that, like us, the British Transport police want to know why the Government have proposed such widespread changes to the British Transport police scheme. Why has the Under-Secretary not been upfront in sharing that information with us? He said that the purposes of clause 70 are purely innocent, but it would appear to make substantial changes. Even if the British Transport police have been consulted, they do not agree with the changes. </p>
<p> I want to draw the Under-Secretary's attention to schedule 5, which is on page 63. Paragraph 3 says paragraph 25 of schedule 7 to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act&mdash; </p>

<p> The hon. Lady asked why we did not share the information with the Committee. If she had asked me in her opening remarks to do so, I would have done so.</p>
<p> I understand the concerns that have been expressed about what people see as a detrimental impact on members of both pension schemes by the establishment of the new police authority, and I hope that I can assuage some of those concerns. I stress that the clause will have no major effects on the current arrangements of providing retirement benefits for the relevant police officers and support staff. The arrangements need to recognise the changed relationship between the Department for Transport and the new police authority once the Strategic Rail Authority is no longer the relevant employer. That is precisely the intention of the clause. </p>
<p> The hon. Lady may know that a working group was set up recently. It includes representatives of all the interested parties, and I understand that they are broadly content with the proposals as outlined. A few issues remain to be resolved, including the trustee structure and the investment of assets. However, I emphasise that those issues are not a direct result of setting up the new police authority, but the result of proposed changes to the current pensions legislation as highlighted in the recent pensions Green Paper. The establishment of the new police authority has provided an ideal opportunity for the issues to be considered, and no action will be taken until the working group has discussed all the relevant options. </p>
<p> I want to clarify that the establishment of the new police authority will not cause the British Transport police's budget to be diverted to pension funds. There will be no undue interference by the Secretary of State in the running of the schemes, as his powers in relation to the schemes is limited. </p>

<p> schemes. I hope that that has clarified the points raised by the hon. Lady.</p>

<p> I have listened with great interest to the debate and did not want to intervene until I heard the Under-Secretary say that there would be no undue interference from the Secretary of State. I want to ask a simple question. Will the Under-Secretary give an absolute assurance that neither the authority nor the Secretary of State will seek through any means, regulation or otherwise, to influence entitlement to benefit under the pensions scheme? That is a straightforward question.</p>

<p> What many of the clauses do is give the Secretary of State certain powers in certain circumstances. I have made it clear that it is not the Secretary of State's role to interfere in the pension scheme&mdash;</p>

<p> Specifically in relation to benefit entitlement, can the Minister assure me that the Secretary of State will not seek to intervene? Will he have regard to the Government's own consultation document, which clearly stated that that would not happen? I want the Minister to say it again.</p>

<p> That is, in fact, the case and I hope that my firmer assurance helps the hon. Gentleman.</p>
<p> The hon. Member for Vale of York spoke about the need for change. The existing trustee, the railways pension trustee company, has nothing to do with the setting up of this particular authority. Current pensions legislation dictates that, by 6 April 2007, existing arrangements will cease, so alternatives will have to be made that comply with member nomination of trustees, general pensions legislation and the pensions protection provisions of the Railways Act 1993. However, establishing the police authority provides an opportunity to decide whether the trustee of the scheme should be changed at the same time. </p>

<p> If I find one thing even more confusing than legal terms, it is pensions. I believe that I understand the reason for the changes, although I am a little suspicious about whether something else might lie behind them. Will the Minister give a categorical assurance that existing members of the pension scheme will experience no detrimental effect on their pensions and that those who come into the new scheme will not experience less advantageous benefits than under the current one? I would be happy to receive such an assurance.</p>

<p> I want to quote from pages 42 and 43 of the excellent Library research paper of 22 January 2003:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''The pension scheme arrangements for the BTP are materially different from those of the Home Office police forces. The BTP scheme is a funded, trust based scheme under which substantial powers vest in independent trustees, whereas the scheme for the main </span></p>
<p><span class="indent">police forces is an unfunded public service scheme subject to traditional scheme regulation by the Home Office. Due to these differences the consultation document stated that it would not be appropriate for the Authority or the secretary of state to make regulations regarding emerging benefit entitlements under the pension scheme trust deed and rules (e.g. on ill-health retirement where the discretion on awards rests with the scheme's trustees). Different circumstances apply for early severance terms, where any compensation costs fall to the Authority rather than the pension fund. Clause 70 and schedule 5 include powers to make transitional provision to a relevant pension scheme to ensure continuity following the establishment of the Authority.''</span></p>
<p> I hear what the Minister says&mdash;that the Government are simply transferring the employer from the Strategic Rail Authority to the British Transport police authority. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, I sometimes find pensions confusing and the subject becomes more alarming the closer to pensionable age one becomes. </p>
<p> I am not sure that changing the arrangements under the Bill will be allowed under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and it could have a serious effect on the force's morale. Will the Minister assure us that the scheme will be funded as it was in the past? I did not hear the Minister say whether the changes will lead to a significant increase in costs, or why the Government are so in favour of making them. I do not understand why the railways pension trustee company could not continue to be the trustee. The concern seems to be that there will be an increased cost and a change of trustee to no apparent advantage. We should not make light of that. The figures for the BTP show that not as many retired BTP officers are being paid out of operational funds as&mdash; </p>

<p> Out of which budget will the increased costs to which my hon. Friend refers come, or will they come out of the pension scheme?</p>

<p> I would love to be able to help my hon. Friend, but I do not have the answer. The total annual budget for the BTP is £130 million. We identified that there will be an increased administration cost of £50,000 a year by increasing the size of the police authority from nine to 13 members, but we look to the Under-Secretary for the answer.</p>
<p> We seek assurance that the BTP scheme is a funded scheme and will continue to be so, and that it will continue to be fundamentally different from the Home Office scheme. I listened carefully to the Under-Secretary's answer to the hon. Member for Bath, but did not hear him give the hon. Gentleman any such assurance. </p>

<p> Obviously, it is always helpful for the Under-Secretary to repeat any assurance, but I received a categorical assurance after I pushed him to do so. Perhaps he can reassure me that neither the authority nor the Secretary of State will interfere in the benefit entitlement to those who should benefit from the pension scheme. If the hon.

<p> I am happy to read the record, and hope that it will speak for itself.</p>
<p> I hope that the Under-Secretary will put our minds at rest that the fundamental differences between the BTP scheme and the Home Office scheme will continue. If there are to be significant increased costs, will the Under-Secretary tell us, in answer to a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, out of which budget they will be paid? Will he also explain why there is an attempt to remove the railways pension trustee company as trustee? </p>

<p> I thought that I had made it clear why there will have to be a change. It is because of the new pension arrangements that will come into effect in 2007. All that the provisions do is ensure that there is the ability to make those changes at the appropriate time.</p>
<p> The hon. Lady asked about TUPE. TUPE does not cover occupational pensions, and there are no issues relating to it in the Bill. She also asked whether the scheme would continue to be funded as before. It will. There is no intention to change the BTP scheme to the Home Office scheme under the provisions. </p>
<p> The hon. Member for Bath asked in a roundabout way about the Secretary of State's ability to interfere. [Interruption.] He is saying that he is satisfied, but I can again give an assurance that the Secretary of State will not interfere in the benefits. I hope that that dispels all doubt about the matter. </p>
<p> The hon. Lady talked about increased costs. If there are any increased costs, those might relate to changes in investment of the assets of the fund. However, as I said earlier, the investment issues are currently under discussion. Again, for the avoidance of doubt, because the hon. Lady mentioned the issue several times, I confirm that the difference will remain between the Home Office scheme and the British Transport police scheme. </p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.16.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1073" speakername="Anne McIntosh" time="10:15" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s06.htm" colnum="350">
<p> At this point, I should like to raise the issue of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, and ask the Under-Secretary why the Government have provided in schedule 5 that paragraph 25 of schedule 7 to the 2001 Act should cease to have effect, such a short time after it passed on</p>
<p> to the statute book. Moreover, section 64 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will have implications for the railways in general. Will the Under-Secretary share with us what the implications of that Act are for the Bill?</p>
<p> There is one glaring omission in the enactments referred to in paragraph 4(2) and in the rest of the schedule: the Human Rights Act 1998, which will have far-reaching consequences for the British Transport police in carrying out their duties. The British Transport police provisions of the Bill are considered to be compatible with the convention, but, for the purposes of the schedule, the convention should have been referred to. </p>
<p> Will the Under-Secretary take the opportunity to put our minds at rest that the jurisdiction and responsibility of the British Transport police will not be frustrated by the 1998 Act? Although British Transport police constables will be given the right to enter railway properties such as railway stations and rail vehicles, and that would engage the guarantee of the right to a private life given in article 8 of the convention and the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions given by article 1 of the first protocol, the Government consider that any such interference is justified. </p>
<p> The Government consider that the exercise of the power is limited to defined railway property, and that the power is available to the British Transport police constables so that they can ensure public safety and prevent crime and disorder. How can the Under-Secretary square the guarantees given by article 8 and article 1 with the new powers for the British Transport police that enable a constable or a rail accident investigation branch officer to enter a private dwelling and to take away personal property of an individual for the purposes of an investigation by the British Transport police? </p>

<p> I am delighted that the hon. Lady is raising this point. She will recall that we had a similar discussion on the first day of our deliberations. Does she share my view that it would be more appropriate for the British Transport police to obtain a warrant to enter an employee's property, as would be the case for a Home Office police force?</p>

<p> The hon. Gentleman tempts me down a dangerous path. I do not recall his supporting our amendment at the time.

<p> Does the hon. Lady agree that I was entirely in order, as I would otherwise have been ruled out of order for my intervention? I referred specifically to the British Transport police. I repeat my question: does she agree that it would be more appropriate in those circumstances for the British Transport police to obtain a warrant before entering an employee's property? In my view, that would be in accordance with her interpretation of the European convention on human rights.</p>

<p> Moving rapidly on, may I continue with my arguments? Train companies will be required by order to enter into police service agreements with the new British Transport police authority. That again engages article 1 of the first protocol to the convention, which protects the economic interest of a person running a business. How can the Government justify any interference that the obligation causes in that right on the grounds that it is in the general interest that the railways are policed and that if the British Transport police authority were not funded, it could not make provision for a police force for the railway?</p>
<p> I am playing devil's advocate because it is entirely possible that the purposes of the Bill could be frustrated by the provisions of the Human Rights Act. I imagine that the Under-Secretary will confirm that is not the intention, particularly in view of wide-ranging provisions on which the hon. Member for Bath and I agree. As part of an investigation, a police officer or an inspector or investigator of the rail accident investigation branch will be allowed to enter any property or to enter a private dwelling, whether owned by an employee or by an individual not connected with the rail company, Network Rail or any other body. They will even be able to take away personal possessions as evidence. </p>
<p> We want to help the Government to advance the intended effects of the Bill. We hope that their intention will not be thwarted by the Human Rights Act. Now that the European convention on human rights is part of our national law, action taken by a police officer that breaches its guarantees may be deemed to violate that law. That may happen even when the behaviour that is complained about is authorised elsewhere in domestic law&mdash;for example, in the provisions of the Bill. I refer in particular to article 5 of the convention, which regulates the arrest and retention of individuals. It may be argued in court that the deprivation of liberty involved breaches the Human Rights Act 1998. </p>
<p> I want to give the Under-Secretary the opportunity to show that the Government have given careful thought to the effect of the Human Rights Act 1998. Why has reference to that Act been omitted from schedule 5? Was that a deliberate error to which the Government hoped that no one would draw attention? The new powers and responsibilities to be enjoyed by the rail accident investigation branch&mdash;particularly those under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the power to enter a dwelling property without a warrant, summons or the presence of a British chief constable&mdash;may be challenged in the courts under the Human Rights Act. Why will paragraph 25 of schedule 7 to the 2001 Act cease to have effect so soon, especially given that it was an amendment of section 90 of the 1996 Act? </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.16.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="10:30" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s07.htm" colnum="353">
<p> Schedule 5 ensures that references to existing legislation on the British Transport police will refer to the British Transport police force as established in clause 3. It is intended that the roles of bodies such as the Strategic Rail Authority and British Transport police committee in respect of the British Transport police should also pass to the authority. Consequential orders under clause 70 will deal with references to those roles.</p>
<p> The hon. Lady's first point was to ask why paragraph 25 of schedule 7 to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 will be repealed. Clause 65(1) and (3) make new provision to replace that paragraph so that a single provision will cover the British Transport police throughout Great Britain in relation to the impersonation of a constable, as opposed to our having provision in both the Police Act 1996 and the Police (Scotland) Act 1967. The new provision will also extend the impersonation offence to British Transport police special constables. I hope that that is helpful. </p>
<p> The hon. Lady asked whether we had given careful thought to the Human Rights Act 1998 and whether we had not included a reference to it in the hope that no one would notice. It is rather improbable that if we had left it out, Parliament would have nodded it through without anyone noticing. I assure the hon. Lady that the schedule does not need to refer to the Human Rights Act, as it replaces references to the old British Transport police with references to the new British Transport police. The Human Rights Act contains no references to the British Transport police. </p>
<p> The British Transport police will continue to operate as a police force under the Human Rights Act, and the Bill will have no impact on their operation in that respect. They will have the full current and future police powers to enter property as per the Home Office police forces, subject to legal restrictions. Jurisdiction provisions will allow the British Transport police to continue to police public railway property just as they do today. The hon. Member for Bath said that the police powers apply to Home Office constables in exactly the way that they do to British Transport police constables in nearly all cases. There will be some tiny exceptions. </p>
<p> Part 3 says nothing about entering property apart from railway property, which is mentioned in clause 29, and it says nothing about employee property. Part 1 spoke about the ability of the rail accident investigation branch to enter property. That was comprehensively discussed in a previous debate. I can confirm that a British Transport police constable has no power to enter a private house. </p>

<p> Let us say that the property is owned, for example, by the train operating company or Network Rail, but is occupied, as a dwelling place, by an employee. Is the Under-Secretary saying that the British Transport police would still require a warrant to enter it?</p>

<p> I hope that the Under-Secretary's words will not come back to haunt him, because any self-respecting solicitor or counsel defending a client to the best of his ability will seek to use the Human Rights Act. I just place that point on the record.</p>
<p> It remains the position of the official Opposition&mdash;I am delighted that this has gained increasing support from the Liberal Democrats&mdash;that on any occasion on which someone acts under the legislation, whether it is a British transport police force constable or a member of the rail accident investigation branch, we would prefer that person to be in possession of a summons or warrant. I cannot believe that that would lead to severe delay. Any person seeking the authority to enter a private dwelling and possibly to remove a personal possession for the purposes of the legislation should do so in the usual way, and warrants and summons should be issued. </p>
<p> We hope that, where possible, the Government would see fit to insist that an investigating branch officer or investigator should be accompanied by a police officer. We have not had confirmation of that at any stage, but it would enhance the provisions of the Bill and lead to an earlier prosecution than might otherwise have been the case. </p>
<p> We have previously discussed impersonation of a constable, and I am mildly surprised that we are getting the answer now to the question that we posed then. The Under-Secretary's answer raises another question. If the Bill creates the offence, what has happened in the intervening period? In Scotland, it has always been an offence to impersonate a constable. Perhaps I have misunderstood what the Under-Secretary said, but it appears that there has been a hiatus for a number of years in which it has not been an offence to impersonate a British Transport police officer. Perhaps he will put my mind at rest on that. </p>
<p> With regard to impersonation of a constable, the Under-Secretary's comments as to why we need to remove paragraph 25 of schedule 7 to the 2001 Act were helpful. We again invite him to consider that it would be appropriate for any British Transport police force constable to seek a summons or warrant, not under his own hand, but from the appropriate authorities in the usual way before entering a dwelling or seeking to remove any personal items </p>
<p> from that private dwelling. Will he also consider that it would be equally appropriate to seek a summons and a warrant in the same way not under his own hand for an investigating officer under the rail accident investigation branch? </p>

<p> As we have said on numerous occasions, in connection with the Bill and at every available opportunity, we regret the tendency for the power of regulations and orders under successive Bills to be made subsequent to the Bill's passing. We hope that here they will be made by an affirmative order of each House, as clause 71 indicates, and that there will be opportunities for any statutory instrument to be debated by each House of Parliament.</p>
<p> For the record we repeat that we would prefer most of the powers to be exercised under the Bill to be written into it rather than left to implementation by statutory order. One need only look at the issuing of statutory orders in the Library and those laid before Parliament to see how many there are. This is an increasing tendency, particularly over the past five and a half years, and it is one that we regret. We hope as far as possible to have an opportunity to scrutinise the orders made under the Bill. We invite the Secretary of State and the Department to make a self-denying order rather than an increasing flood of statutory instruments. I hope that the Under-Secretary will take the opportunity to confirm that that is the Government's wish. </p>

<p> When handling any primary legislation, we regularly have this discussion about which powers are taken by secondary legislation. This clause provides the procedure for making regulations and orders under this part of the Bill. In general, all orders and regulations will be subject to the negative procedure. That means that they will be laid before the House and can be annulled by a resolution. As the majority of regulations in this part will be based on Home Office precedents, affirmative resolution instruments would be unnecessary.</p>
<p> Orders under clause 70 would amend other enactments to allow the transfer of the existing British Transport police to the new authority. They would therefore involve the taking of so-called Henry VIII powers. The orders will include employment issues, and it is therefore appropriate that they receive Parliament's approval via the affirmative procedure. At the appropriate time, the House will have an opportunity to discuss them. </p>

<p> I am extremely disappointed by that honest but unsatisfactory answer. I repeat as vigorously as I can that while we welcome the opportunity to follow the affirmative procedure in regard to what the Under-Secretary referred to as the Henry VIII orders, we deplore the fact that other orders will be laid before the House by negative procedure. To us, that is an entirely unsatisfactory procedure, and the Opposition will remain vigilant as ever in ensuring that any order, regulation or statutory instrument laid before the House which we feel is inappropriate will be prayed against.</p>

<p> I shall not mention the aside made by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge. The tendency since 1997 is borne out by the numbers, which demonstrate a wholly unacceptable increase in the use of orders. The order-making power in clause 70, particularly in respect of employment conditions, is appropriate and welcome. Will the Minister confirm that pension provisions are also included and will be dealt with through the affirmative procedure? We have expressed on behalf of the British Transport police serious concerns about the pension provisions.</p>

<p> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that confirmation. We shall pray against every conceivable order that we believe to be inappropriate and laid through the negative procedure. The Bill provides an opportune moment for the Department and the Government to break with tradition in that respect.

<p> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's clarification following an earlier debate. I should like to confirm it and have it written into the record. The clause deals with interpretation and offers several definitions. I recall our interesting discussion on the trolley bus, which could impact on interpretation. I also recall asking about light railway trams and trolley buses, which I classed as a sub-group of railways. I apologise; for the record, that classification appeared in the Under-Secretary's reply to my question:</p>
<p><span class="indent">''That is a sub-group of railways and as such it has no defined separate legal meaning.''&mdash;[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 13 February 2003; c. 194.]</span></p>
<p> I was grateful for that clarification. However, it is important to place on the record the fact that that formulation, as reported in Hansard, introduced&mdash;in the Under-Secretary's words, not mine&mdash;''a factual error''. As the Under-Secretary intended to clarify, light railways are sub-divisions of railways, but in the official record, his clarification suggested that trolley buses are also sub-groups of railways with no defined separate legal meaning. However, he wanted to assure me that that is incorrect. </p>
<p> Clause 1 is based on the Transport and Works Act 1992, which defined tramways and trolley buses in detail. The Under-Secretary helpfully made it clear that his point applied solely to light railways. We had a light-hearted aside at the time, and I am grateful that the matter has been clarified. We have a strong tradition of trolley buses, and although I do not think that we are now a nation of trolley buses, it is important to get the definition correct and to put it on the record. </p>

<p> According to the hon. Lady's information, are there any trolley buses in Britain at the moment and are we ever likely to have any?</p>

<p> I can say with some authority that we do not have any trolley buses in the Vale of York, but I do not know whether that is repeated across the realm. Legal definitions are important, though, because there may be applications for trolley buses in the future.</p>

<p> We are talking about trolley buses now, but a few years ago we might have been having a similar conversation about trams. We thought that trams were a thing of the past, but now they are the future.</p>

<p> That leads me neatly on to my second point on why clause 72 is deficient. My first point was that, as we might use a wrong definition in any amendment, the Under-Secretary should clarify the definition of ''trolley bus''. My second point is that clause 72 is deficient because of the point about trams. The Committee seems to agree that we cannot think of a trolley bus operating in the United Kingdom, but I would hate to exclude the prospect of trolley buses returning, as they would undoubtedly be environmentally friendly and energy efficient.</p>
<p> This is a good opportunity to clarify the position of the tram. I know that it is on the record, but it would be good to have it in the Bill. I was taken by the Under-Secretary's clear explanation of the difference between a tram and a trolley bus. If I remember correctly, a tram runs with overhead wires on tracks and is deemed to be a railway for the purposes of the Bill, whereas a trolley bus runs with overhead wires on the road and is deemed to be a road vehicle. </p>

<p> I hate to go into this further, but clause 72(3) defines railway property as including, in paragraph (e),</p>
<p><span class="indent">''a railway vehicle on a network or tramway''</span></p>
<p> and, in paragraph (h), </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a vehicle used on a tramway''</span></p>
<p> My hon. Friend may be able to find out whether either definition means a tram. What is the difference between a railway vehicle on a tramway and a vehicle on a tramway? </p>

<p> As ever, my hon. Friend puts the point much more eloquently than I do. I am trying to elicit the difference between a tram and a trolley bus for the purposes of the Bill. When is a vehicle a railway vehicle, and when is it a road vehicle? Will the Under-Secretary give us a clearer definition of the difference between the definitions in paragraphs (e) and (h)? Otherwise, the clause will lead to great confusion.</p>

<p> As you will undoubtedly have observed, Mr. Hood, it is not my custom or style to stand up for every clause and give it the detailed forensic examination that we have grown used to from the hon. Member for Vale of York. I am sure that the Committee is grateful to her for that, but I find myself disappointed with her contribution on clause 72. She rightly asked several questions, and we will look to the Minister for the answers, but I do not believe that she has gone far enough. You more than most, Mr. Hood, will be able to cast your mind back to 4 February to the very first sitting on clause 1, which covers issues of definition in relation to part 1, in which there is a requirement to define railway property. We are now dealing with part 3, and rightly there is a need for clause 72 to give definitions of railway property.</p>
<p> I am confused about why there are so many significant differences between the definitions of railway property in part 1 and those given in part 3. Will the Minister help me by explaining the differences? I see no reference to property being defined in clause 1 in part 1 as it is defined in clause 72(3)(e) and (h) in part 3: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a railway vehicle on a network or tramway . . . a vehicle used on a tramway.''</span></p>
<p> Do those differences imply that parts of property are likely to be investigated that could not be investigated by the RAIB because they are covered by the British Transport police? That does not make much sense. However, I thought that I had found the answer to my own dilemma. I looked back, as I do&mdash;I try to prepare thoroughly for these enjoyable sittings of our Committee, which will come to an end all too soon&mdash;[Hon. Members: ''No!''] I am delighted to hear those demands around the Room for an extension so that we may hear more contributions from the hon. Member for Vale of York. </p>
<p> I diligently re-read the words of the Under-Secretary&mdash;we often like to read them&mdash;and those of the Minister for Transport, who told us: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''The rail accident investigation branch will investigate accidents and incidents relevant to the operation of the railway. The definition of railway property is drafted to reflect the places where a railway accident or incident would occur that could be the subject of an RAIB investigation.''</span></p>
<p> He continued: </p>
<p><span class="indent">''Extending the definition would mean that the RAIB had a duty to investigate accidents in a railway station back office, for example, which are more properly the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive.''&mdash;[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 4 February 2003; c. 6.]</span></p>
<p> It would appear that there are different definitions of railway property in parts 1 and 3. The definitions in part 1 cover those parts of property that the RAIB might investigate, but in part 3 we have a definition of railway property where the British Transport police might properly investigate; presumably, a crime could take place in a railway station back office. There is therefore a good reason for the difference, but will the Minister say where those differences are to be found? What is the difference between the definitions that we have here? We have exactly the same definitions, but in part 3 we have added properties, although there is no specific reference, for example, to a railway station back office. Can the Minister tell us whether the definitions are intended to be the same in both cases, in which case why are some items added to the list in part 3 but not included in part 1, or are they meant to be different in the way in which the Minister of State has said that they are different&mdash;relating, for example, to railway station back offices? If they are meant to be different for that purpose, can he explain how the definitions before us achieve that? </p>

<p> I return briefly to the point about trams, not because of a pedantic interest but because, as the Minister will know, there is an advanced scheme to run a tramway from Uxbridge to Shepherd's Bush, roughly along the route of the 207 bus. That is broadly welcomed in my constituency, but closer to London, along the Uxbridge road, it becomes more contentious. However, it will almost certainly run, so, for the sake of my constituents, it is important for me to know the exact definitions for tramways and trams, and for what vehicles are used on a tramway and whether they are motorised. I must press the Minister for an answer.</p>

<p> Before my hon. Friend the Minister clarifies all this confusion in his usual crisp and clear way, can I ask him to bear in mind the problems of guided bus ways? In Luton, we are likely to have a guided bus way on a railway line, which is to be converted. I am sure that he will be able to deal with that. I raise it now so that no confusion arises from further questions.</p>

<p> This innocent little clause has occasioned an enormous amount of interest. I shall endeavour to answer briefly the points that have been made. The clause defines the terms used in this part of the Bill. Primarily, existing statutory definitions are used from the Transport and Works Act 1992 and the Railways Act 1993. Railway services and railway property are also defined in relation to standard statutory terms. In an intervention, the hon. Member for Vale of York became exercised by trolley buses. She did not know whether there was a trolley bus in the United Kingdom, but never mind, she asked for a definition anyway.</p>

<p> I want to put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. There are no trams in Scotland, yet the Bill will apply to trams. On the same basis, there are no trolley buses at this time in England. However, I am sure that the Government would not wish to preclude the possibility of their return.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.20.16" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s09.htm" colnum="360">
<p> Indeed not. The provision exists in anticipation that the Scots may wish to provide trams in Scotland.</p>
<p> Let us move to the point about the trolley vehicle system. That means, according to section 67 of the Transport and Works Act 1992, </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a system of transport by vehicles constructed or adapted for use on roads without rails under electric power transmitted to them by overhead wires (whether or not there is in addition a source of power on board the vehicles);''</span></p>
<p> I hope that that is helpful to the hon. Lady. I assure her that British Transport police will not cover trolley vehicles because they do not travel on rails; they are buses. The guided bus referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North is also in the same category&mdash;bus, not rail. </p>

<p> Would that last point about the guided bus not come under subsection (3)(f), which refers to</p>
<p><span class="indent">''rolling stock on a network or tramway'',</span></p>
<p> or subsection (3)(h), which refers to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a vehicle used on a tramway''?</span></p>
<p> What is the difference between a tramway and a railway? </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.20.18" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" time="11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s09.htm" colnum="360">
<p> The difference is that the tramway has a rail, and the guided bus does not run on a rail. That is the simple answer to that.</p>
<p> The hon. Member for Uxbridge wanted precise definitions of each category. They could be read into the record, but it would take a long time and would be rather boring. The categories have all been set out, and if members of the Committee want precise definitions of all terminology, I will be happy to provide a note rather than go through them now. </p>
<p> Clause 72 defines terms used in the jurisdiction of the British Transport police, including public policing and public areas of railways. Clause 1 provides the areas where rail accident investigators have jurisdiction. The Bill describes the meaning of railway property clearly in two places. The list contained in part 3 goes a little wider to make it clear that railway property covers wider scenarios and in respect of which persons could be required to enter into an agreement under clause 31. </p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/standing/standing2003-02-04_D_11-0_2003-02-27a.20.19" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/895" speakername="Don Foster" time="11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/d/st030227/am/30227s09.htm" colnum="360">
<p> I listed three items: a railway vehicle on a network or tramway, a train used on a network and a vehicle used on a tramway. If part 3 goes wider, does that mean that the RAIB would not carry out investigations in relation to that property, whereas the British Transport police can carry out investigations in respect of alleged crimes on such property?</p>

<p> I hope that I have understood the hon. Gentleman's question. The RAIB's area of jurisdiction was set out in part 1. Part 3 sets out the responsibilities of the British Transport police. I thought that that was fairly clear. The hon. Member mentioned particular railway vehicles or tramways, but, as far as I understand it, those would be identical.</p>

<p> I want to elicit from the Minister whether the other matters that the hon. Member for Bath mentioned are inside or outside the jurisdiction of the RAIB.</p>

<p> On the two points that the hon. Member for Bath made, the RAIB would investigate if there were accidents on such vehicles. The hon. Member for Uxbridge mentioned railway property and asked about clause 72(3)(e) and (h). Paragraph (e) mentions</p>
<p><span class="indent">''a railway vehicle on a network or tramway''.</span></p>
<p> In other words, the railway vehicle could be used on either. Paragraph (h) mentions </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a vehicle used on a tramway''&mdash;</span></p>
<p> that is, the vehicle used only on a tramway. The intention is to cover the two circumstances where some vehicles can be used on both and some can only be used on a tram network. I hope that that has covered those important points. </p>

<p> Clearly, it has not. We will have to return to this issue. I invite the Government to come up with a much clearer definition than is currently in the Bill because there will be enormous problems in establishing the precise jurisdiction of the RAIB. Although we discussed it in a very light-hearted fashion, that is precisely why I drew attention to the difference between a trolley bus and a tram. It is obviously important with regard this issue, too.</p>
<p> Subsection (5)(a) refers to a ''light maintenance depot''. It is interesting that the subsection refers not to a locomotive, but to a train. The corresponding section 83(1) of the Railways Act 1993, which is mentioned for these purposes, gives a definition of a locomotive. Is that because we are all now meant to know what a locomotive is as opposed to a train? The list of definitions is not comprehensive. We are trying to help the Government&mdash;[Interruption.] We differ and oppose the Government on some issues, but here we want to help by ensuring that the definitions are so clear that endless debates and court cases about the jurisdiction of the rail accident investigation branch can be avoided. Subsection (5) refers to both a light maintenance depot and a train, but I wonder why it does not also refer to a locomotive. Network is also mentioned, so why not locomotive? </p>

<p> Never let it be thought that anyone should seek to delay our proceedings so that we deal with alcohol after lunch, but I suspect that that is happening. I agree with the hon. Member for Vale of York that anyone listening to our deliberations might think that we are off our trolleys. [Interruption.] I just thought it up.</p>
<p> The Minister of State, Department of Transport stated on the record that the definitions of railway </p>
<p> property in part 1 are specifically drawn. More precisely, he said that the definition </p>
<p><span class="indent">''is drafted to reflect the places where a railway accident or incident would occur that could be the subject of an RAIB investigation.''</span></p>
<p> He continued: </p>

<p> I refer to it again because the Minister has not answered the question why the definitions of railway property in part 3 include several examples of property that are not included earlier. In responding to the hon. Member for Vale of York, he said that the RAIB would investigate an accident if, for example, it occurred on a train used on a network. Why is that formulation not included in part 1? We have received no clear answer to that, which is disappointing. As the hon. Lady said, we will at least have an opportunity to return to these matters later. </p>

<p> We referred earlier to a tramway in Scotland. It is right and proper to recognise that Scotland has no trams at the moment, but it may well in future. Equally, we want to allow for the possibility of the return of trolley buses. As we said in respect of clause 72, we urge the Government to table appropriate definitions before the Bill leaves this place.</p>

<p> May I say a few words about this brief clause? It establishes the current territorial extent of this part of the Bill. It applies to Great Britain, but tramways&mdash;even though they do not yet exist in Scotland&mdash;are excluded as a devolved matter. If a tramway were to come into operation in Scotland, it would be for the Scottish Parliament to determine appropriate arrangements for its policing. The British Transport police currently operate throughout England, Scotland and Wales, but not in Northern Ireland. The clause does not change that.</p>

<p> I am delighted that the Committee is moving on to a perhaps more controversial part of the Bill, although we are not necessarily in disagreement with the Government. The provisions are a response to a gap in the law whereby there is no legislation to regulate alcohol consumption in the maritime industry, other than a general provision in section 58 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Clauses 75 and 77 define the respective persons covered by the Bill. We believe that the clause should be more specific and we wish to probe the Minister on whether he would see fit to extend the definition.</p>
<p> The amendment relates to subsection (1), which limits the definition to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''(a) a professional master of a ship''&mdash;</span></p>
<p> I think that we all recognise who a professional master of a ship is&mdash; </p>
<p><span class="indent">''(b) a professional pilot of a ship, and</span></p>
<p><span class="indent">(c) a professional seaman in a ship while on duty.''</span></p>
<p> We heard from the Government on Second Reading that, in relation to, I think, pilots of ships, they could imagine circumstances whereby a professional mariner may not be on duty, but may be required to be on duty&mdash;they may be second on call, or whatever. How widely will the phrase ''while on duty'' be defined? Will the definition be exclusive or will it include those about to go on duty within a certain number of hours? </p>
<p> I shall confine my comments now to the amendment. It has been put to us that perhaps a </p>
<p> clearer definition of a professional mariner or professional staff on duty would be </p>
<p><span class="indent">''any person employed in any capacity aboard a vessel, including'',</span></p>
<p> and then the definition continues. The amendment is a probing amendment. We hope to have an indication from the Minister as to how widely the provisions will be interpreted. Similarly, amendment No. 76 would add a subsection (1)(d) that would refer to </p>
<p><span class="indent">''a person whose primary and main function is the command of a vessel carrying passengers for a fee.''</span></p>
<p> There is some concern in the industry that the current definition does not cover every potential category of those who should be covered. </p>
<p> As drafted, the title of the clause is ''Professional staff on duty'', whereas we had, I think, an indication from the Secretary of State that the provisions would apply to those who were about to go on duty. It might be of some assistance if the Minister gave some thought as to how such matters could be defined. Does the Minister intend to consider the rota for those first on call or those second on call? </p>
<p> We shall, I hope, have a broader debate on part 4 later, and we recognise the background. </p>
<p> It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order. </p>
<p> Adjourned till this day at half-past Two o'clock. </p>
