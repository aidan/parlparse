<p> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary announcements to make. If people wish, they can remove their jackets; I see that one or two hon. Members have already done so. Will all members of the Committee please ensure that their mobile phones and pagers are turned off or are switched to silent mode during our proceedings?</p>
<p>Adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, so the reality is probably that the time for amendments is passed.</p>
<p>We are still in the early days of taking oral evidence in Public Bill Committees, so it might be helpful if I explain the procedure to make it clear to everyone. The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme motion on the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to consider a motion to report written evidence and a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence sessions that I hope we can take formally.</p>
<p>Assuming that the third motion is agreed to, the Committee will then move into a brief private session. When the Committee has deliberated, witnesses and members of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral evidence session will commence. If the Committee finishes its questioning at a reasonable time before One o&rsquo;clock&mdash;I understand that that is the expectation&mdash;it will move on to the more familiar proceedings of clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill, after a short suspension to rearrange the room. I hope that that is clear. I now call the Minister to move the programme motion.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> As you know, that in itself, as a matter of principle, is something that the Treasury would, naturally, want to have an interest in. For the serious purposes of the Bill, it is part of the overall reform that the Pensions Bill made to pensions provision, and a lot of the measures were announced in the Budget. We discussed this on Second Reading, and the broad purpose of the Bill is simply to ensure that, by making the changes that we are proposing, the anomaly that we have recognised for the higher earners&mdash;those contributing to the national insurance contributions fund&mdash;do not get a disproportionate benefit later, as a result of their pension payments.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> We were aware that this was possible as a likely consequence of the reforms in the discussions leading up to the Budget. Both HMRC and the Treasury were aware of this possible consequence. However, further work needed to be done in order to be clear how best to correct the anomaly in a way that would be fair to everybody, which was the Government&rsquo;s intention. It did not become clear until further work had been done between the Department for Work and Pensions, HMRC and the Treasury on exactly how to do that. It was apparent to us that it was better to do it separately in a Bill of this nature, rather than to take the reform forward as an amendment to the Pensions Bill.</p>

<p> I support simplification and can understand one of the ideas behind the Bill. What thought was given by the Treasury to try to make the matter revenue-neutral: in other words, by reducing the upper earnings limit to such a degree that this whole aspect was revenue-neutral? Was any consideration given to reducing the upper earnings limit, rather than to increasing the limit at which national insurance is paid, to get to that point? I can understand the idea that the Treasury would wish to simplify the entire system&mdash;that makes a certain amount of sense&mdash;but clearly, the way in which the current Treasury has decided to go about this will hit middle-income earners who are about to, or are already, paying income tax at the upper earnings limit. Why was this not made revenue-neutral in such a way that the interests of those people were protected?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span><span class="italic">   </span>The overall reforms that were announced in Budget 2007 represented a reduction in the taxation on employment and were funded by revenue raised elsewhere in the tax system. In broad terms, there was a tax cut related to those elements around the removal of the 10p rate of income tax&mdash;the cut to the basic rate&mdash;and the alignment of the upper earnings limit with the point at which you start paying income tax.</p>
<p>The aim for higher income individuals&mdash;those who will be basic rate taxpayers after the reforms have been introduced&mdash;was to leave them no better or worse off. The overall package, which increases the upper earnings limit for those taxpayers but enables them to enjoy a cut in the basic rate, should leave them no better or no worse off overall than they would have been if the Budget 2007 reforms had not been implemented.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> Taken on its own, your point is valid. We have repeatedly said that this is part of a package. It is part of a major reform that we are taking forward. Overall, the families in the income bracket that you are talking about will see no change to their relative position.</p>

<p> If I can just pick up on that, there is no disputing the fact that revenue will be raised as a result of the Bill&mdash;the question asked by the hon. Member for Norwich, North&mdash;but someone must be losing out. If you are saying to me that the middle-income families will find this revenue-neutral, who exactly will be losing out as a result of these measures?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> If I can explain, the position of some higher rate taxpayers, depending on their national insurance position and whether they have contracted out, is that they made a small gain from the Budget 2007 reforms. In that sense, the changes here are not disadvantaging relative to the position before Budget 2007, but they take back some of that gain. That is why this Bill can raise revenue without making anyone worse off than they were before Budget 2007. I hope that that is helpful.</p>

<p> Dealing with the anomaly that the Minister referred to in her response to my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North, I wonder why the alignment of the upper earnings limit and the upper &nbsp;accrual point is being done in two stages. Prima facie, it occurs to me that, after the first step of that alignment, which is effective from April 2008 until April 2009, when the second full step of alignment will be made, the anomaly to which the Minister refers will continue.

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> There are two issues. Obviously, the intention of the Budget 2007 reforms was to introduce those changes as quickly as possible. However, there are limits to what this Bill can look at, especially with regard to any changes that can be made without legislative change to the upper earnings limit.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> The national insurance Bill will allow those changes. From April 2009, we can fully align the upper earnings limit and the point at which people start paying the higher rate of tax. However, as part of the step in that direction, the initial stages were taken to start the alignment process from April 2008, but the words &ldquo;legislative constraints&rdquo; meant that it could not be done all in one go. Therefore, it is a two-stage process. The second stage is dependent on the legislation in the national insurance Bill.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> If I could just add to that, Mr. Marris, if you look at the impact assessment, which is available to Committee members, four options were considered when we were considering what to do to respond to the circumstances as we believed they would develop. One of those options was to do nothing; one was to do the change effective from April 2009, but two other effective dates were considered as well. On balance, we believed that it was better to go for the earliest possible effective date on which we could change it. Bear in mind that we are all the time seeking to simplify the tax and benefit system in the UK, and that was also an important consideration.</p>

<p> I quite understand that. It strikes me that for a year, between April 2008 and April 2009, we will not have the simplification that we will have from April 2009 onwards.

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> The constraints are that&mdash;Mr. Mitha will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the upper earnings limit is limited to a maximum of seven and a half times the lower earnings limit and that to align that upper earnings limit with the point at which people could start paying higher rate tax would actually mean an increase above seven and a half times. That limitation means that alignment cannot happen all in one go. Currently, the point at which you pay higher rate tax is more than seven and a half times above the lower earnings limit.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sam Mitha:  </span> Under the current legislation, prior to the enactment of the National Insurance Contributions Bill, the upper earnings limit is set at seven and a half times the primary threshold. Once the Bill is enacted, assuming that it is passed in the form that is being proposed, Ministers will be able to set it at a level that is set by regulation, subject to affirmative resolution. At the moment, the maximum of the upper earnings limit that could be set prior to the passage of the Bill that is currently before Parliament is seven and a half times the primary threshold, which is currently &#163;100 a week&mdash;the level at which national insurance class 1 contributions become payable.</p>

I understand that that is perhaps what you are getting at. The truth is that we felt that&mdash;rather than bring this forward as a Government amendment to a pensions Bill, which we could not necessarily guarantee would be debated in full&mdash;this was a better vehicle to use, given that we wanted to take the time to get right the changes that we believed were necessary. Rather than bring that forward in a set of Government amendments, which we all know can be dealt with very quickly and very often to the dissatisfaction of Members of both Houses, we felt that this was a better way of doing it.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> As I said, it is a step on the way to a simpler system. Obviously, other changes are happening from April 2008, such as the reduction in the basic rate, looking at the package as a whole. Also, as I said, the aim was to make certain that people who are higher rate taxpayers after the changes are introduced will be no better or worse off. There was also a desire not to create a windfall gain for those people by making no change now, only to then take it away the following April, or to give them a windfall loss, only to compensate them in the following April. It is very much from the desire of leaving higher rate taxpayers no worse off this April, compared with the April before, and April 2009, compared with April 2008.</p>

<p> I wish to clarify the anomaly to which the Minister referred earlier. I got the impression that you were talking about the upper accrual point and the fact that we are going to run into some difficulties, as opposed to the upper earnings limit? If there is an anomaly, it is the fact that you stop paying national insurance contributions before you start paying higher rate income tax&mdash;a gap that has existed for a while.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> The long-standing anomaly is exactly as you describe it; that is clearly what the reforms in the Budget set out to look at. We then looked at consequential issues around the upper accrual point. As the Financial Secretary made clear, those issues were considered at the time, but we wanted to come back to them subsequently, because there are a number of complex issues when talking about the second state pension and how changes in the accrual point would affect state pension entitlement.</p>

<p> Can we just turn to the question of Budget losers? I take your point that, in isolation, the changes to the upper earnings limit will raise revenue&mdash;&#163;1.1 billion in 2008-09, and &#163;1.5 billion in 2009-10. One could look at it as part of an overall package, but my memory is that the analysis done by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that a group of people earning in the range of &#163;39,000 to &#163;40,000 would lose out overall? Considering it not in isolation but overall, they would lose out. Is that analysis correct?

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> I do not have a breakdown by income group, but I have one for type of household. Bear in mind that these are within the context of the overall package, including the other changes brought forward by the 2007 Budget.</p>
<p>Around 5.3 million households will pay marginally more. That is a lot of households, but that is in the context of the 21 million households that will be either better off or no worse off. It is in proportion to that figure. Of the 5.3 million households that will lose, about 3.7 million will have a loss of less than &#163;3 a week. </p>
<p>A further breakdown that I gave in answer to a parliamentary question I repeat for the sake of clarity. About 900,000 households that contain a single adult would see their income decrease by an average of about &#163;1.45 a week. There are 700,000 households with more than one adult but with a single earner; they would see their income decrease by slightly more&mdash;about &#163;2 a week on average. There are 3.3 million households that are worse off in which two or more adults are defined as earners, who will see their income decrease by around &#163;2.60 a week on average. And then there are about 800,000 single adults with an income below &nbsp;&#163;18,500 who will see their income decrease by &#163;1.45 a week on average. About 600,000 women aged between 60 and 64 will also see their income decrease, but they will often be in households with other earners or other people in the household. We anticipate that most of them will be in households with more than one adult.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> If it would help, I could provide an example of someone earning at the upper-earnings limit, or above, who would fall into that group. Using the 2008-09 tax year as an example, most employees earning at the upper limit, or above it, will be better off: the loss of the starting rate tax band means that they will gain about &#163;232 per year; the upper earnings limit being raised to &#163;770 means that they will gain a further &#163;390 per year, and the reduction of the basic rate to 20 per cent. means that they will lose &#163;673 per year. Overall, we calculate that they will be about &#163;51.60 better off.</p>

<p> They are the people who will be better off, but they are not the people that the IFS identified as the losers. I take your point that they are marginal losers, but there will be different groups and we must bear in mind fiscal drag. However, may I follow on from a question raised by Mr. Field about how this will work? I take the point that, in simplistic terms, the tax increase&mdash;the increase in national assurance contributions and the doubling of the 10p band&mdash;paid for the 2p off income tax. In broad terms, that is what it did. How did that work? Did an instruction come from up on high saying, &ldquo;I want to knock 2p off income tax; find me some ways to fund it!&rdquo;? I am curious about how the Treasury works in these circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> I was not informed at the time. We had a number of objectives, the first of which was to seek to simplify the personal tax system in the UK. We listen to, and are conscious of, the criticisms of the complexity of the system for personal and business taxation, which is why that was one of the policy objectives of the changes. The second and very important objective was to test the current personal tax structure in order to see whether it best served our objective of reducing child poverty by bringing more children out of relative and absolute poverty. I think that I am right in saying that the changes that we are making, and have made, as a result of the 2007 Budget, and some of the changes today, mean that we will take a further 200,000 children out of relative poverty. That was an important consideration. There was a degree of redistribution in the way that we did it to ensure that we gave as much help as we could to families with children, which will help towards that objective.</p>

<p> On redistribution, Minister, my memory of the IFS analysis&mdash;ignore our relatively small group of 39,000 to 40,000&mdash;tells me that it was not a bad Budget for those on middle incomes but that many people who earn less than &#163;18,000 were losers, if only by a small amount. In that sense, from a redistribution point of view, it was a curious Budget, because some of the losers were at the poorer end of the scale.</p>

<p> This question might be one for the officials, because they were at the Treasury at the time. Did the Treasury, when officials were working through the process of reaching a Budget, ever model a tax-neutral realignment of national insurance and income tax? If you did, I should like to know what it looked like. I assume that it would have a higher level at which people start to pay higher rate income tax. Did you ever model that?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> A number of options would have been looked at. As I said, overall, the reforms from Budget 2007 on personal tax represented a cut of around &#163;2.5 billion. If you wanted to use the upper earnings limit and the point at which people pay higher rate tax as the balancing item, you would have to reduce the income at which people start to pay higher rate tax. If you wanted to make it revenue-neutral within the personal tax system, it would mean a reduction, so people would start to pay higher rate tax lower down.</p>

<p> I might be confused. There are two ways of aligning. You can raise national contributions up around the limit, so people pay 11 per cent. for &nbsp;more, or you could reduce the point at which people start paying higher rate income tax, so rather than paying 22p&mdash;it is now 20p&mdash;they start paying 40p. In a way, the fact that the Government have raised the upper earnings limit raises less revenue than the alternative approach. Is that correct?</p>

<p> But if you wanted a revenue-neutral measure, you would shift up the rate at which people pay higher rate income tax. The higher rate threshold, in other words, would go up higher still. I have not done the sums, but rather than 43p, it would be 45p or 46p. Is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> The logic actually works the other way around. Once the upper earnings limit and the point at which people pay higher rate tax are aligned, the marginal effective tax rate below that point&mdash;national insurance plus income tax&mdash;would be 31 per cent. That comprises 20 per cent. income tax plus 11 per cent. national insurance. Above that point, it is 41 per cent.&mdash;40 per cent. income tax plus 1 per cent. additional national insurance charge. If you wanted to raise money, you would want people to be paying more of their money at the 41 per cent. rate, so you would reduce the threshold.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> A set of reforms evolves over time; there are ideas. As the Financial Secretary said, the Government had principles about simplification, tackling child poverty, work incentives and taking pensioners out of tax. If you look at the package as a whole, the Government believe that it is a sensible set of reforms that is best placed to meet those different objectives. I am not certain that it necessarily makes sense to consider individual components in isolation, because it is very much a package. The removal of the starting rate and the reduction in the basic rate have effects for higher rate taxpayers and need to be factored in when considering their overall tax position.</p>

That being the case, you will work with officials to test those objectives, not necessarily to conduct an academic exercise to see what the whole range of different options are in detail. You would give a relatively clear steer on what you wanted to achieve and then ask for proposals that met those objectives. I am not sure whether the specific option mentioned was considered, but Ministers will have given a very clear steer at the time as to what they wanted to achieve, and tax rises and other things would have been part of that discussion.</p>

<p> We are talking about, I think, 5.3 million losers under the overall arrangements. The question is whether you feel that the then Minister could have said, &ldquo;Wait a second. I can identify two big groups of losers.&rdquo; That is those who benefit almost or completely from the lower, 10p rate but do not earn enough to benefit from the reduction from 22p to 20p in the basic rate, who are relatively low earners, and the people who benefit from the admittedly somewhat anomalous position of their marginal rate going down&mdash;the &#163;39,000 to &#163;40,000 income earners. Those are the two big groups that took a big hit from the Budget.</p>

<p> Do you want me to have another stab at that? As the Minister said, these measures are all considered as part of a package. The changes to national insurance funded the proposals, as did the abolition of the 10p rate. Interestingly, as the Minister has admitted, that meant that there was a redistribution from some people on relatively low earnings, who benefited from the 10p rate but did not earn enough to benefit from the cut in the basic rate to higher earners&mdash;something that struck many people as a curious political feature of the budget.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> We are in some difficultly here. I could answer purely on national insurance, but that would not give the Committee a full picture of the overall intention. In order to be helpful I have set the parameters fairly wide&mdash;it makes it more difficult for me and perhaps also for you.</p>
<p>I would like to give an example of how the process would have worked, as that seems to be of most interest. When the discussions were taking place, issues would have been flagged up with regard to who the potential losers from different packages would be. As a result of that, a package would have been brought forward that was engineered to address those people. For example, as a result of this package and because of the changes to the threshold that we have made, around 580,000 fewer pensioners will be paying income tax than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
<p>Where there were going to be losers as a result of the change, we were careful to ensure that those losers were not in the categories that other Government priorities clearly wanted to help. When these issues are discussed and the options looked at, any decisions that are made have to be balanced, and sometimes there will be some losers. However, as we have said, we sought to make those who lost out do so in a very small part. They are losers but not with a capital &ldquo;L&rdquo;, and overall, looking back at the changes that we have made to tax and benefits since 1997, there are no losers. Even those that we have mentioned are still well over &#163;900 a year better off as a result of the full reforms that we have made since we were elected in 1997.</p>

He went on, &ldquo;To reform the system in a useful way within tight financial constraints and with only modest...losses should be a cause for congratulation rather than criticism.&rdquo; The intentions behind that, in terms of making a useful series of reforms while minimising the number of people who would lose from them, was exactly the Government&rsquo;s intention.</p>

<p> It was not included in the figures. Okay. My second question is brief, and it is about the Minister&rsquo;s comments on incentivisation to work. The key people who were losers from the Budget were, generally, single people with no children. In terms of their typical profile, I guess that they would tend to be younger people. How does that stack up with our levels of youth unemployment? Although we all understand the desire to ensure that families with children are supported and that child poverty is tackled, that longer-term aim of ensuring that young people are in work in the first place seems to have been undermined by this aspect of the Budget. Was that matter discussed prior to the Budget?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> There are a number of observations to be made here. First, employment has risen strongly in recent years for almost all age ranges. When we look at work incentives, there is a concern that parents, in particular, face some of the toughest work incentive problems because of the way that the benefit system has grown and changed over time. Often, they faced the biggest unemployment trap, and found it difficult to make work pay, particularly with child care costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, many of the reforms have been aimed at further strengthening work incentives for families with children. That was why the working tax credit threshold was increased. It will also benefit those without children who receive the working tax credit. In that sense, work incentives for many low-paid people, particularly parents, were actually improved as part of that series of reforms.</p>

<p> But, it strikes me that perhaps the easiest time to get those who are unemployed into work is before they have additional barriers to work. Taking care of children as single-parent families is clearly identified as a barrier to work. Obviously, employed people who then have children will often get support from their employers. So, it seems that perhaps the danger of the Budget was that it undermined the best time to encourage people to go into employment, which is before they have children.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> The reforms are taking place in an economy in which employment itself has grown very strongly. Notwithstanding the debate that is taking &nbsp;place about those not in education or employment, employment among young people has grown strongly. I know that in my constituency, as many of us will who have constituencies where youth unemployment was a serious scourge, it is now virtually non-existent. Therefore, it is within that context that we quite rightly started to look at how we could use the tax and national insurance contribution system to give more assistance to those households to which we were seeking to offer the most help and make the biggest difference, particularly in helping them into work.</p>
<p>The areas of greatest focus now are those people who continue to have difficulty getting in to work&mdash;those who have children. A whole range of policy measures were put in place to help families in those circumstances. All those have to be funded, and clearly those are issues that Government need to consider, when taking forward a reform of this nature. Equally, we are doing it in the context of an economy that is continuing to perform well in providing employment opportunities. In that context, you can start to consider making the kinds of decisions that were made in Budget 2007. Had we been in the context of a labour market of 15 or 20 years ago, such decisions would have been much more difficult for the individuals affected.</p>

<p> If it went up by that sort of figure&mdash;let us say, from &#163;105 to &#163;110&mdash;we would stay within the seven and a half ratio, because 110 times seven and a half is more than 800.

We wanted alignment at the top. Given those aims of simplification and alignment, there was a constraint within the legislation.</p>

<p> But you could have achieved that objective by increasing the starting point, which now goes up to &#163;105. Obviously, the more you increase that, the easier it is to get within the seven and a half. You have to be careful not to increase it so much that you drop below six and a half.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> I am not sure how helpful this is. The purpose of the reforms was to achieve three major policy objectives, one of which was to simplify the upper point at which there was alignment between tax and national insurance contributions. A legislative brake applied to the point at which national insurance contributions could be aligned, so to achieve the other policy objectives, primary legislation was necessary to make that change. The point is that, if the objective was simply to achieve the seven and a half times and stay within that, we would have taken a completely different route, and we would not be making the changes that we are making today.</p>

<p> My final point is that the changes were made around 1992 and included the legislative safeguard that the figure would not be more than seven and a half times higher than the bottom one. A concern that some people may have is that that safeguard is being removed and is not being replaced with a higher level of eight, rather than seven and a half or eight and a half. As I understand it, there is no specified higher level, and it will not require primary legislation in future to change that. Some people will say that they understand that you want to align the two and to simplify the matter, but if you are doing that and all it requires instead is to break the 7.5 multiplier and to make it 7.52 or whatever it will be&mdash;it will be a fraction over 7.53&mdash;you are opening the doors to go up and up as high as the Government may wish at the time. It seems strange that, for 0.03, this legislative change is required. Some people may fear that Ministers in the future may exploit or even abuse it, when it would require only a tiny tweak to stay within the current limit.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> But there is no legislative requirement to meet at the lower end&mdash;at the point at which you start to pay contributions. There is none whatever, so it seems illogical to continue with the upper limit purely because it exists. There are sound policy reasons, as I have advanced, for that particular alignment spread, including not only the three main policy objectives of the 2007 Budget, but the correction of the pension anomaly that resulted from pension reform, so that we achieve the overall objective of pension reform with all-party support when we implement it.</p>
<p>Members may have that concern, but recognising that, we will take forward changes to the national insurance contributions upper earnings limit through the affirmative procedure in both Houses. Both Houses will have an opportunity to debate the proposals, so it is not as though the Government will be able to act with impunity; there will be very clear and robust scrutiny of any such proposal.</p>

<p> Before we return to the issue of national insurance contributions and the constitutional way in which they are changed, you said, Minister, that there was not really a restriction on the lower end. But if there is a ratio, it restricts both ways, and you cannot cut the rate at which people start paying if you have a ratio that holds you steady at the top. I have not expressed that very clearly, but it applies both ways, and the point of the ratio is that it stops a big distance between the primary threshold&mdash;it used to be the lower earnings limit&mdash;and the upper earnings limit. Is my understanding correct?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> That is very much the way in which the ratio works, as you say, by limiting the gap between the two. However, there is the existing commitment, dating back to the 1999 Budget, of the alignment, instead of the primary threshold at the point&mdash;with the personal allowance&mdash;at which you start paying any income tax at all. So that is the constraint on the bottom. Given that that is Government policy, the ratio bites only on the top of that band.</p>

<p> I should advise everybody to double check any numbers that I calculate, but to follow Mr. Browne&rsquo;s questions, if the primary threshold in 2009-10 went up to &#163;107&mdash;that is at the lower end of our expectations for an increase&mdash;and the ratio of seven and a half continued, that would get us above a weekly figure of &#163;800, I think.

<p> I think it would be helpful to the Committee to have an understanding of how national insurance contributions are changed generally. Perhaps it would be even more helpful to do that in comparison with income tax. Obviously, they are both taxes on income, and the relationship between the two is getting closer by the year. Could someone guide us on how rates and thresholds of national insurance contributions are set, compared with income tax?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sam Mitha:  </span> National insurance contribution levels are actually set annually as part of a re-rating exercise, following a report by the Government Actuary&rsquo;s Department. The Government Actuary examines the balances of the national insurance fund and makes recommendations about what future increases in national insurance contributions may be necessary. The system operates as a pay-as-you-go system, and on the basis of the Government Actuary&rsquo;s report, the Treasury and HMRC make recommendations to Ministers about future increases in national insurance contribution levels. Until fairly recently, most of those increases have been predicated on the basis of increases in prices, or when balances in the national insurance fund have at any time appeared to be inadequate to meet the commitments of the fund, Ministers have recommended slightly larger increases.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sam Mitha:  </span> The surplus in the national insurance fund is basically something that goes towards funding public services, because it reduces the level of Government borrowing. If there were not a large surplus in the national insurance fund, the Government would need either to raise taxation or borrow the money on the open market. It is not always possible to predict accurately what the calls on the fund will be. It is usually possible to predict what the major call will be, from state pensions, but the fund is used also to pay other contributory benefits such as contributory jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and incapacity benefit. It is not always possible to quantify that. The Government and the Government Actuary&rsquo;s Department usually recommend that the fund be managed on a very prudent basis.</p>

If there is a shortfall on the national insurance fund, general taxation can be used to shore it up, but when there is money in the national insurance fund, the only purpose for which it may be used is to pay contributory benefits.</p>

<p> You mention the money put aside for the NHS. To our mind, that area has totally muddied the waters between income tax and national insurance contributions. It is not, perhaps, too fanciful to suggest that a future Government&mdash;perhaps even this Government&mdash;might look to do a similar thing by putting a penny on national insurance for the education system, or some other form of moneys. You mentioned earlier that it is a pay-as-you-go system. It now seems apparent, from what my colleague, Mr. Gauke, said, that the reserves are at an historically high level. Is there a realisation that there are likely to be significant takers from that fund in the foreseeable future? Is it the perspective of the Treasury, at least, that it is a prudent device?</p>

<p> I understand the official hesitation about answering what is quite a political question, but the answer to the question is yes, is not it? However worthy the cause, that it is a contributory insurance scheme no longer applies&mdash;the same with the 1p running right through the system. It means that national insurance is no longer what it says on the tin. The rationale for merging it with income tax is all the greater after the changes that were used to fund the NHS and to honour the promise of not raising basic income tax made at a general election.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> If we were to merge the two into one tax on income, we would have to find a different way of funding benefits and pensions out of that general tax take. That would be an imprudent step. We would have to expend a lot of time and energy on finding a guaranteed way of funding such things, particularly in &nbsp;relation to pensioners, where we have to meet a public commitment. I do not accept the argument. We had the argument about the status of the national insurance fund and NICs when the change was made, some time ago, and there has been broad public support for it. The exception was quite clearly defined in law. The House has decided on that point.</p>

<p> I shall avoid a discussion of the number of people who are on out-of-work benefits, which has remained stubbornly above 5 million; but presumably, we can expect the national insurance fund balance of &#163;34 billion to increase yet further.

<p> On that point, it obviously depends on the call on the fund. But the call on the fund will be less because the higher rate earners affected by the changes in the Bill will get a lower state second pension than they would have done, and the flat-rating, as it is called, will be achieved by 2031, instead of 2035.

<p>I have one further point on how we use national insurance contributions. My colleagues have quite rightly pointed out to me that, actually, the national insurance fund has been used for many years to support the health service. If you ask most members of the public what they consider national insurance is used for, most of them would associate it with the national health service, rather than with the benefits that we know the majority of it goes towards. That is a more general point.</p>
<p>There are no further plans at the moment. Other than the changes that we are making today, which would allow the process to be taken forward through affirmative resolution, there is nothing further proposed&mdash;unless you want to deal with income tax by affirmative resolution.</p>

<p> We have agreement on that, anyway.</p>
<p>Given that, as you say, the spending of the national insurance fund goes on the health service, as well as contributory benefits, and given the professed desire for greater simplification and the fact that we are making these changes to the upper earnings limit to align with higher rate income tax, is there any view to take this further? For example, there are currently differing definitions of earnings.</p>
<p>John Whiting, former president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers and a fairly resident expert on Radio 4&rsquo;s &ldquo;Money Box&rdquo;, says: &ldquo;It is worth noting that the alignment of income tax and mixed thresholds does not complete the alignment of the two levies that many, especially employers, would like to see. We still have differing definitions of the earnings subject to the levies with various anomalies.&rdquo; He goes on to say: &ldquo;Hopefully the review of income tax and NIC alignment started by the recent PBR will produce changes that will pay a real simplification dividend, even if this will mean another NIC Bill.&rdquo; Where are we in relation to the review of simplification in this area?</p>

<p> I take your point on timing, but the issue with the ratio that we have been debating is not an issue for 2008-09. We know that the ratio will be below seven and a half. The issue is for 2009-10. If this were debated later in the year, whether with the Finance Bill or not, there would still be time to make the changes for 2009-10, so that the ratio is reformed. What is the cut-off point at which it is too late to amend the ratio for 2009-10?</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> Traditionally, it has been the practice to give employers good notice of changes, particularly with national insurance, because of the nature of the system. Because it is non-cumulative, it is not possible to make changes during the year in the same way that you can with income tax. There are different constraints on the system. As I said, the decision to make full alignment only in April 2009 was to give us good time for a Bill, knowing that parliamentary timetables can be very busy and compressed. Therefore, it is possible that this could be done later, but the earlier we can do it, the more certainty we can give employers about what the changes will be.</p>

<p> Is there a huge administrative gain for employers in knowing today what the upper earnings limit will be for 2009-10, when they do not know what the primary threshold will be? Presumably, they make their adjustment together. I ask that in curiosity; I do not know the answer.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sam Mitha:  </span> In normal circumstances, if the upper earnings limit was going up with prices, it would be announced with the primary threshold. At the moment, we are talking about a very large increase in the upper earnings limit in order to align it with the higher rate threshold for income tax. That will necessitate some procedural changes, because the legislation will bring forward the upper accrual point. That is why employers need a greater degree of certainty about it. They will need to update their procedures and software, so that employees are ready to deal with the changes.</p>

<p> We are, therefore, coming back to our comparison with income tax and national insurance contributions. The Finance Bill does the changes for income tax for that year&mdash;the year that we are in. Therefore, this summer&rsquo;s Finance Bill will deal with everything from 2008-09. At the same time, we need to do the national insurance contributions. For argument&rsquo;s sake, we could not do it at the same time because we are actually a year ahead. Therefore, the two could not be aligned in that sense.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> Yes, that is correct. One of the reasons why that is the case is because national insurance is collected over a pay period, which means either weekly or monthly. Income tax, on the other hand, is balanced over the year. It is possible to make changes to the income tax parameters during the course of the year and the system will balance out over the year as a whole. Whereas with national insurance, everything needs to be tied down before the start of the tax year.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> There are two totally separate structures for considering the rates of income tax and national insurance. For ease of reference, Erskine May describes national insurance contributions on page 782. He stated, &ldquo;To the extent that they are payable into the National Insurance Fund, contributions paid by earners, employers and others under the provisions of social security legislation are not regarded as charges upon the people or as subject to the rules of financial procedure&rdquo;. We would have to implement primary legislation to be able to consider national insurance in the Finance Bill. It would certainly not be possible to achieve that by 2009-10, and I am not even persuaded that it would be desirable.</p>

<p> That is very helpful. I come back then to one of the points that we started with. We have a very different system for national insurance contributions. If we go back to the mid 1970s, the Executive&rsquo;s ability to make changes by regulation to the system was restricted by things such as the ratio between what was the lower earnings limit, now the primary threshold, and the upper earnings limit. That structure is now being dismantled in this Bill.</p>

<p> I want to probe some more. If national insurance contributions and the figures and thresholds have to be nailed down by the September before the April, and income tax is not nailed down until the June after the April when the Finance Bill goes through, how will we get continuing alignment for the years 2010-11 onwards? That cannot be done unless you pull out your calculator after the September nailing down of the national insurance figures to tell you what income tax will be from the following June without a political decision on what that income level will be.</p>

<p> Does the Minister agree with Mr. Marris&rsquo;s question that, as far as the political landscape is concerned, this is going to make the PBR a more significant event than it currently is? Does it throw up any practical concerns? We know that the state of the public finances can change fairly dramatically from the autumn through to March, when the Budget is announced. Indeed, that has happened a fair bit in recent years. Therefore the decision as to what you do with income tax is going to be made at a time when you are less sure of the state of the economy and public finances than previously was the case. Is that a concern?</p>

These were quite large and fundamental reforms to the system. There were a number of consequential issues. We knew that we had to deal with the entire knock-on effects to lots of different systems. We were looking, for example, at the way it affected charities. These were all things that we knew about at the time and we had to have a process, once the Budget had got out of the way, of reflecting on those further, having had informal conversations with key stakeholders. We knew that there were a number of issues that we were looking at. We set out quite a clear narrative in the Red Book around all the issues, but then we knew there were some other issues that we needed to look at.</p>

The intention here was that for those who were paying the contracted-out rate of national insurance there would actually be a small windfall gain. What we were trying to do for the majority of those people was to claw back some of that small gain, so that we could fulfil our objective of not making higher rate taxpayers better or worse off. That is the primary way in which that money is raised. I do not have the figures to hand, but I cannot envisage that it would materially affect the number of people who would lose.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> Because presumably Ministers at the time were not requesting that sort of detail. We were working on a major package of reform for pensions, and had been doing so for a period of years. In the &nbsp;income impact assessment we openly concede that when the personal tax package was announced in the Budget 2007, it was never intended to give the state second pension benefit and the extra benefits to higher earners that were perceived as being likely as a result of some of the other changes. Because of that, we wanted to do further work to see how we could correct that within the framework of our reforms, and within a framework of simplification of the overall tax system. That is one of the reasons why the process took the shape that it did.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Jonathan Athow:  </span> Traditionally, Budgets are put together under tight security. This was a very large set of reforms, and there was necessarily the usual Budget purdah process.</p>
<p>We can work at some of these issues more easily on our own. We have the resources of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs to help us do that. In other areas, we need other sets of input. For example, we wanted input from the Department for Work and Pensions and other parties interested in pensions to find out the right answer there. For some of these, as I said, there are limits to what you can do in-house. Therefore, it is sensible to make the changes that you can make, and, when you know that there are other issues that you need to follow up, to do that as quickly and sensibly as you can after the event. Realising that the changes were affecting a series of pension reforms that had been through extensive debate and commentary, we wanted to think very carefully before making those changes, and not simply to spring them on people.</p>

<p> I would just like you to clarify something about the figures in the Red Book, Mr. Athow. I apologise if you do not have a copy in &nbsp;front of you, but items 20 and 21 deal with income tax and national insurance contributions. The first regards the phased alignment of five thresholds; the second relates to raising the higher rate threshold and upper earnings limit. As far as the projections of the financial implications to the Exchequer for, say, 2009-10 are concerned, is that figure net of the additional rebates that will need to be paid to opted-out second state pension funds as a consequence of the higher national insurance contributions?</p>

<p> Just to explain why I asked the question: in the PBR, in the list of revenue-raising items, a saving is identified, which essentially the Government are explaining is the additional cost incurred because more rebates are being paid out, which was not the intention. I understand that, but was that additional cost picked up here? I am slightly worried that we might have double counted that saving, because we did not identify the additional costs in the first place, but now we are identifying the saving in the PBR.

<p><span class="italic">  Jane Kennedy:  </span> The potential delay to the state pension reforms was recognised, as we have been discussing for the past half an hour, during discussions within the Treasury and with HMRC, and during the formulation of the personal tax package for the 2007 Budget&mdash;in advance of the Pension Policy Institute&rsquo;s statement. However, because it is such a complex policy area, it was quite proper that a solution was worked out across government to address the potential delay.</p>
<p>I must pay tribute to the very considerable efforts made by officials in the Treasury and HMRC to achieve the objectives and priorities set by Ministers. Officials are set targets for presenting solutions that will work for a Budget, and they perform superbly. It was quite proper that we took the time necessary on this set of proposals in order to get them right. That is why we can discuss them today with so little concern from outside experts that we are the only people being grilled here this morning.</p>

<p> I am not concerned so much to understand the process, which we discussed earlier, but about the decision taken that the right approach to the problem was to raise revenue via alignment at the earlier periods, rather than to give up alignment in 2030-31.

<p> I am sorry, but you misunderstood the question. I am not arguing for the do-nothing option, but for considering impact assessment option 4, which was to introduce the upper accrual limit in 2012, when the other measures will be introduced. For a reason that we have not got to the bottom of, you decided that that was not appropriate, although it would have pushed out alignment to 2035. That seems to have been the primary objective; the Government decided to stick to 2030, which, albeit, will raise more tax from people over the next few years.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sam Mitha:  </span> Delaying bringing in the upper accruals point until 2009, which this Bill seeks to do, might have disrupted the contracted-out rebates for pension providers. We explained to Ministers the consequences of each of the four options, and it seemed that the one that employers and pension providers would find easiest to cope with was the one that Ministers brought before Parliament. Waiting until 2012 before introducing an upper accruals point would have caused even greater complexities and far more difficulty for pension providers than they have faced, and they would have had to deal with the consequences. We have been able to minimise the disruption to them.</p>

<p> Did you consider the potential impact on the industry in the event that the pension regime does not come in in 2012? This Bill will pass before the end of the tax year. At this point, it is the only piece of legislation that relates to the package of measures introduced in other legislation such as the Pensions Act 2007. However, this Bill is the only one that will bite before 2012, and it remains uncertain whether the earnings link will be restored. You are therefore encouraging the industry to go down a particular course that may or may not link with other measures in subsequent years.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sam Mitha:  </span> These decisions were taken when the Pensions Bill was before Parliament. That Bill included a strong commitment from Ministers and the Government that the earnings link would be restored in 2012, or at any rate by the end of the next Parliament. We also gave a firm indication, in the form of the legislation that Department for Work and Pensions Ministers introduced and Parliament passed, that an upper accruals point would be introduced from 2012.</p>
<p>The changes introduced by the Chancellor in the Budget resulted in the decision that you have been debating and questioning the Minister about today. If Ministers had not taken the decision to bring forward the upper accruals point to 2009 and if they had delayed it to 2012, there would have been a very severe degree of disruption for pension providers&mdash;they would not have certainty about contracted-out rebates, because they would not have known what would happen.</p>
<p>It would have resulted in additional difficulties. Pensions are a difficult subject, and it is already difficult enough to explain what is happening. More fundamentally, following the Pensions Commission report, Ministers outlined a vision for pension reform that included as an integral part the changes to the state second pension, which will be brought back into line when the Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>

<p> I have just one question to follow that up. I hear what you say, but I fail to understand why the industry would be thrown in confusion and would not know what would happen in 2012 if we legislated for, or if you had chosen, option 4, which would have made the upper accruals limit in 2012 clear.</p>

<p><span class="italic">  Sam Mitha:  </span> We have obviously engaged in a lot of analysis of the options in consultation with the DWP. As a result of the work done in collaboration with our colleagues in the DWP and the Treasury, we concluded that the change would mean that the schemes are not required to increase their funding or benefits to meet &nbsp;the tests that pension schemes must pass to be contracted out of the state second pension. The proposal that Ministers brought forward will reduce the disruption for pension schemes more than the other option.</p>
<p>We went through each option in great detail with people who are experts on the way in which pension arrangements work, and I am in close touch with the industry about the possible impact of the changes. Ministers have not received formal representations from pension providers or employers following the publication of the impact assessment, which outlines the analysis and which caused Ministers to take their decision.</p>

<p> I want to pick up on that because, on Second Reading, both my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire and I probed about which figures were in which book&mdash;the Budget and the pre-Budget report. The colleague of the Minister who is here was clear about the fact that the flat-rating of the second state pension being brought forward was in the Budget book and, at the time, my sense was that it could not have been given what you have said today and my understanding of what was done.</p>
<p>Can we have some clarification? When the Minister said the hon. Member for Putney</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;asked whether we knew at the time of the Budget that there was an issue about aligning the state second pension&mdash;flatrating the upper earnings limit&mdash;and about the changes that the Bill brings into effect to prevent unintended windfalls for those who earn above the higher earnings limit. We knew that that was the case, so this is not, as has been alleged, incompetence&mdash;in fact the figures featured in the Red Book as part of the national insurance contributions calculations&rdquo;,&mdash;[<span class="italic">Official Report</span>, 17 December 2007; Vol. 469, c. 664.]</p>
<p>that was incorrect. Preventing unintended windfalls was not in the Red Book; it was in the pre-Budget report and, quite rightly, it could be said that it was a clawback and used as part of the figures that paid for the changes on inheritance tax, but it was not in the Red Book. That was incorrect.</p>

<p> I think that if you read back through the quote, you will find that it is at odds. But I understand the position and that is the result that I was trying to achieve. Thank you.</p>

<p> Does anyone else have any questions? In that case, it remains for me to thank the Minister and her officials for coming along. At various &nbsp;stages, officials have said that they do not know the answer and that they can go away and find out. I hope that the Minister will ensure that, whenever those references were made, the necessary inquiries will be made and the information provided to members of the Committee. I hope that she can arrange for that.</p>

<p> I endorse your statement, Mr. Chope. The Minister read out a list of bands of income that would be affected and the number of people who would be affected. Some of us may have managed to scribble them down, but it would be most helpful if the Committee could be provided with a full copy of the impact assessment on individuals.</p>
