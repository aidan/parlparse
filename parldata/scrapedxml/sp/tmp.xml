<p>Good afternoon. As always, our first item of business is time for reflection. Our time for reflection leader today is Elaine Duncan, the chief executive of the Scottish Bible Society.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-09-09.19347.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Elaine Duncan (Scottish Bible Society)"  colnum="19347" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-09/sor0909-02.htm#Col19347" time="14:00:00">
<p>Presiding Officer, members of the Scottish Parliament and friends, in 1809 a small group gathered less than a mile from here. They met to constitute a society to promote</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;the circulation of the scriptures at home and abroad&quot;,</p>

<p>especially among the poor in Scotland. Thus the Edinburgh Bible Society, now the Scottish Bible Society, was formed.</p>

<p>The early 19<sup>th</sup> century was a time of turmoil coupled with opportunity. Across Europe the Napoleonic wars raged, while technological advance meant that transport opened the possibility of travel to the new world. This period saw the formation of many great missionary societies and charities, some of which still flourish today. Moved by concern for the plight of their fellow human beings in Britain and beyond, people put faith into action.</p>

<p>Through our sophisticated 21<sup>st</sup> century eyes, the well intentioned actions of those people of God may seem old-fashioned, even misguided, yet their passion for justice, compassion for the poor and integrity of heart echo through two centuries. The values that they held dear&mdash;values that drove them to sacrifice time, energy and resources&mdash;we see woven into our mace, the foundation on which contemporary Scotland is built. People motivated by wisdom, justice, compassion and integrity are surely what our nation needs in 2009.</p>

<p>We also live in a time of turmoil and opportunity. The global village offers young Scots limitless employment and leisure opportunities, yet we also see the turmoil of poverty, the breakdown of community and the repetitive patterns of addiction and abuse. We face a new world of possibility, but many of today's problems are rooted in the same issues the 19<sup>th</sup> century reformers faced.</p>

<p>The Bible is rich as a source of wisdom for a healthy society&mdash;you would expect me to say that, wouldn't you? However, it also teaches that the best drafted laws, the finest education system and the most caring welfare structure are powerless to <place-holder colnum="19348"/> change human nature. Legislation, education and care cannot eradicate greed, envy, jealousy or selfishness. Although this ancient text contains wisdom for government, a society based merely on the Old Testament laws and the New Testament morality is no utopia. Rather, the Bible confronts us with the reality of the human condition and our need to engage with the living word of God in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>As the Scottish Bible Society celebrates its 200<sup>th</sup> birthday, we are encouraging the people of Scotland to rediscover the truth and relevance of Scripture. We want people to be stirred by the passion and commitment shown by the 19<sup>th</sup> century men and women whose discovery of the source of wisdom, justice, compassion and integrity propelled them to be world changers and life bringers. We also want them to experience an inner transformation through a personal encounter with Jesus Christ, the living word. May he inspire and energise you through this session of Parliament.</p>

<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss in Parliament new arrangements for making available state-funded legal representation for relevant persons in children's hearings, by way of a Scottish statutory instrument that was made in June and which I will refer to as the SSI.</p>

<p>As some members will be aware, the matter has been discussed at length at the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee. As I have already done at committee meetings, I make clear the Government's commitment to protecting and promoting the principles and ethos of the children's hearings system. The system is all about the best interests of the child, and the SSI will help to ensure that that remains the case.</p>

<p>By way of background, the SSI ensures that relevant persons may be provided with free legal representation to assist them in a children's hearing if that is necessary to ensure their effective participation in the decision-making process. A relevant person is usually the child's parent, but it can be other people who have a close involvement in the child's life. The Scottish Government made the concession in the context of a legal challenge in which an individual argued that the absence of provision for state-funded legal representation breached their rights under the European convention on human rights. The Court of Session has not yet issued the judgment in the case, so I am sure that members will understand if I do not go into details about its particular circumstances. However, the Scottish Government has already accepted that the absence of any <place-holder colnum="19351"/> provision whereby a person could apply for state-funded legal representation before a children's hearing if there were unable to participate effectively without such representation was incompatible with articles 6, 8 and 14 of the convention.</p>

<p>That rationale applied to any relevant person who was unable to participate effectively at a children's hearing without legal representation. Therefore, the Government decided to act quickly&mdash;as soon as it was clear that there was a legal requirement to make available assistance in certain circumstances&mdash;to ensure that any relevant person who was incapable of participating effectively in a hearing because of their physical or mental capacity had the possibility of legal representation if their individual circumstances merited it. That is why the Government took the unusual but legitimate and justifiable step of breaching the 21-day rule by bringing the SSI into force the day after it was laid in Parliament in June.</p>

<p>The SSI provides an interim route through which such provision can be made proportionately and quickly; the regulations are carefully restricted and we see no less intrusive way of resolving the difficulty. However, I propose to include a permanent scheme in the children's hearings (Scotland) bill that I plan to introduce to Parliament early in the new year. As such, nothing in the statutory instrument ties the Parliament's hands in relation to the children's hearings (Scotland) bill. If evidence suggests that the arrangements introduced by the SSI do not work, we can look to revisit them in the bill.</p>

<p>I move on now to emphasise what the consequences will be of annulling the SSI. I place on record my deep disappointment that the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee chose to support the motion to annul and potentially jeopardise support to some of Scotland's most vulnerable people. I have spoken to the committee at great length about the fact that the SSI is no longer about securing a right of representation; that point of law has already been conceded and I ask you to bear this in mind today.</p>

<p>The main issue boils down to the fact that the committee seems determined to remove a measure that simply prevents the most disadvantaged people in Scotland from being further disadvantaged. Relevant persons can already have legal representation at hearings if they can afford to pay for it. I have repeatedly made that hugely important point, which the committee has failed to recognise. So, I ask, are you as a Parliament really going to say to a person who does not have the capacity to participate effectively in proceedings about their child, &quot;You <place-holder colnum="19352"/> can't pay so you can't have help&quot;? I urge you to vote against annulment of the SSI.</p>

<p>I make it clear that voting to annul the SSI will not prevent from coming forward cases in which relevant persons need support. It will, however, prevent some of the key people at hearings from accessing the support that they require and are entitled to in meeting their basic human rights. Annulment will not magically remove those people from the system.</p>

<p>Before the minister concludes, can you give us the Government's view on the legal effect of passing the motion today? Is it the case that the SSI would cease to have legal effect as from today and that the law would therefore revert to where it stood before you laid the SSI?</p>

<p>Yes, Mr McLetchie is correct in his interpretation. Following a vote by the Parliament to annul the SSI, we would have to revoke it with immediate effect as of tomorrow. That would remove the current rights of relevant persons and, as the member is undoubtedly aware, it would also call into question the children's hearings system and its ability to make disposals in line with the ECHR.</p>

<p>I will just make this point. In 2002, state-funded assistance for children was introduced. The SSI simply extends that state funding to relevant persons&mdash;primarily parents&mdash;in certain circumstances. I very much hope that members see how a decision to annul the SSI could seriously affect those who might need legal representation. If, for example, a relevant person is assessed as having the language ability of a child of six and a half, the literacy skills of an eight-year-old and the numeracy skills of a six-year-old, how can we honestly expect them to have their say and to put across their perspective without help and support? We have a moral duty to support them.</p>

<p>I say to the minister that as I extended his time, I might have to reduce his time for winding up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2009-09-09.19352.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80403" speakername="Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab)"  colnum="19352" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-09/sor0909-02.htm#Col19352" time="14:14:00">
<p>One of the few things on which Adam Ingram and I will agree this afternoon is that it is truly regrettable that it has become necessary to debate this motion to annul in the Parliament. I firmly believe that, had the minister shown a <place-holder colnum="19353"/> willingness to listen and respond to the serious concerns that have been raised by the chairs of Scotland's children's panels and by the majority of members of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, today's debate would have been unnecessary, but he seems determined to ignore those concerns and appears to be more focused on attacking those who raise them than on responding to them constructively. However, I am pleased that, today, he changed his tone slightly from the one that he used at committee yesterday.</p>

<p>Members raised a number of concerns at last week's committee meeting. They focused primarily on the potential for the instrument to introduce a much more legalistic approach to the children's hearings system. The minister attempted to allay those fears by stating that that would not be the case and that the measures would apply to only a handful of cases. When pressed, he initially agreed with Kenny Gibson that there would be about 12 to 20 cases a year, but when he returned to the committee yesterday the number had risen to 250 cases a year. However, anecdotal evidence that I have received from panel members and reporters throughout Scotland leads me to believe that the number will be far higher. Some reporters have told me that the wording of the instrument means that at least half of the cases that they deal with could be affected.</p>

<p>For me, that is worrying. If ministers and civil servants can so badly misjudge the impact of the instrument, how can we have confidence when we are told that it will not lead to the children's hearings system becoming increasingly legalistic? Equally, how can we&mdash;or the minister, for that matter&mdash;have any confidence about the affordability of the instrument? If his department has budgeted for 10 to 20 cases a year but the actual number is many hundreds, what impact will that have on his department's budget and on local authorities?</p>

<p>During the minister's contribution to the committee's debate yesterday, he tried to imply that there was a strong level of disagreement about the SSI among panel members and chairs throughout Scotland. I have to say that the minister really needs to get out more. Yesterday, I spoke to Phillip White, the chair of the Argyll and Bute panel, who said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The introduction of this SSI will undoubtedly lead to the whole complexion of the children's hearings system changing from child friendly to legalisation and the focus on the child will be lost in the ensuing legalese. Any changes to the system must ensure that we get it right for every child.&quot;</p>

<p>A panel member from Glasgow told me:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not understand why the Government is so determined to rush into this measure. I am very concerned <place-holder colnum="19354"/> that this will change the child-centred nature of our hearings system.&quot;</p>

<p>That member was John Anderson, who is depute chair of the Glasgow panel. In addition, similar concerns have been raised with me by chairs and panel members from throughout Scotland, including Ena Williamson of West Dunbartonshire, Irene Allison of North Lanarkshire and Shona Lynn from Dundee. Let me make it clear that those panel members and chairs came to me and my colleagues to express their concerns.</p>

<p>SNP members have accused me of playing politics with the issue. If listening to and representing the concerns of panel members is playing politics, I am guilty as charged. If trying to ensure that the rights of the child remain paramount within the children's hearings system is playing politics, I am guilty as charged. If asking the Government to justify the rationale behind the instrument is playing politics, once more, I am guilty as charged.</p>

<p>I repeat for the record that neither I nor any of the people who have contacted me want the Government to ignore the issue of legal representation of parents and carers. No one wants any parent or carer to be unable to engage in a hearing that will take decisions about their child's future. However, is the Government's proposal the best way to deal with the situation? I do not believe that it is.</p>

<p>No, I am not going to give way. I am sure that the member is going to speak.</p>

<p>Would it not have been much more effective to engage with stakeholders on the issue and deliver appropriate change in partnership with them? That is what the previous Administration did in 2002. We did not rush in and draft a change that would have had unforeseen consequences.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the minister claimed that the Government had to act because of a court ruling. However, the Government is pre-empting that ruling, because it has not yet been made. It would have been far better if the Government had awaited the ruling and, during that time, constructively engaged with and consulted people about how we ensure that parents and carers are properly represented and engaged in the hearings process.</p>

<p>For the minister to warn that annulling the instrument would leave panel members open to potential ECHR challenges was at best misleading and at worst blatant scaremongering that could have caused needless anxiety to panel members. Why is the Government acting in this way? <place-holder colnum="19355"/></p>

<p>Because the minister has failed to engage effectively and work with others.</p>
