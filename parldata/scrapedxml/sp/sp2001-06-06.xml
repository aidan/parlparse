<p>It is always a pleasure to welcome one of our neighbours to lead time for reflection. Professor William Storrar of New College is here to do that today.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2001-06-06.1259.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Professor William Storrar (Director, Centre for Theology and Public Issues, University of Edinburgh)"  colnum="1259" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-01/sor0606-02.htm#Col1259" time="14:30:00">
<p> Over the years, I have made occasional appearances in the sheriff court&mdash;in a pastoral capacity. Once, I was asked by an elderly parishioner to accompany him to a hearing before the local sheriff. His son suffered from severe mental illness and, at that time, the only way in which the son could be admitted to hospital against his will was to seek a court order. The Scottish mental health act of the time required that. The stress of seeing his son being questioned in court by the sheriff caused the elderly man to collapse. The court was cleared and a doctor was called. I found myself standing in the corridor with the son's consultant psychiatrist. The psychiatrist was furious: &quot;It's bad legislation that may have killed that old man&quot;, he snorted. The old man recovered and the son received the hospital care he needed, but I have never forgotten the consultant's words: &quot;It's bad legislation that may have killed that old man.&quot; Bad laws destroy lives.</p>

<p>That was brought home to me again in a recent visit to South Africa. A former African National Congress prisoner showed me round Nelson Mandela's cell block on Robben Island. There, as I looked into the tiny cell where that other old man spent long years in captivity, I could see that the destructive power of the apartheid laws lingers on, long after Mandela's release. Wicked laws devastate nations.</p>

<p>However, good laws can protect lives and renew nations. Good laws ensure justice among competing claims, protection for the weak and accountability of the powerful. Thousands of years ago, in ancient Israel, the prophet Micah declared the eternal purpose of all legislation and the eternal calling of all law-makers. Micah, chapter 6, verse 8, says:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does <place-holder colnum="1260"/> the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.&quot;</p>

<p>So many of us, for so many generations, have longed for the day when there would be a law-making Parliament again in Edinburgh. Now that it is here, I, your neighbour on the Mound, have only one request to ask of you, our Scottish law-makers, before you leave us. When the new Parliament building is complete, you will move from the Mound down the hill to Holyrood. When you first walk into the legislative chamber, where Scotland's laws will be framed, for good or ill, in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, take off your shoes, for you walk on holy ground.</p>

<p>As with the stage 1 debate, I will not detain the Parliament for long on this matter. The bill is a short technical bill that contains only two sections. It amends the wording of the Local Government Act 1988 to remove the time limit on the period during which competition provisions in that act may be modified. The bill is necessary so that the current moratorium on compulsory competitive tendering can be continued beyond 31 December 2001.</p>

<p>I have already given assurances to the Local Government Committee and Parliament at stage 1 that we intend to publish legislative proposals on best value in the autumn. Our preparatory work is well under way and we have set provisional timetables for the publication of our proposals. In the meantime, we believe that it would not be prudent simply to repeal CCT without a suitable legislative backing for a best-value regime to replace it. We do not intend to return to CCT by default; we must act now to extend the time period within which we can continue the moratorium. We have chosen to do that simply by removing the date reference in the existing legislation.</p>

<p>In summary, the bill is a technical one that permits us to continue the moratorium on CCT. As such, it is a short-term but necessary solution to a technical problem. It will be necessary until&mdash;and only until&mdash;we can introduce a replacement best-value regime. We intend to publish the legislative proposals on that regime in the autumn.</p>

<p>I move,</p>

<p>That the Parliament agrees that the Scottish Local Authorities (Tendering) Bill be passed<em>.</em></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2001-06-06.1265.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80160" speakername="Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP)"  colnum="1265" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-01/sor0606-02.htm#Col1265" time="14:40:00">
<p>I will try to keep within the time limits.<place-holder colnum="1266"/></p>

<p>Members will recall that we had a full debate on the Scottish Local Authorities (Tendering) Bill on 17 May. I do not intend to go over the same ground, particularly as colleagues' thoughts may be focused somewhere else. At that time, the SNP made its position clear. We support the abolition of CCT. The bill has our full support in continuing the moratorium. We therefore back the Executive in this instance and call for the bill to receive the whole-hearted support of all MSPs. We look forward to legislation on best value being introduced this autumn.</p>
</speech>

<place-holder time="14:40:00"/>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2001-06-06.1266.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80169" speakername="Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con)"  colnum="1266" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-01/sor0606-02.htm#Col1266" time="14:40:00">
<p>I too will be brief, but I do not think that I will take 34 seconds, which is what Kenneth Gibson took.</p>

<p>We opposed the bill at stage 1 as we endeavoured to create some impetus within the Executive to introduce legislation on best value at an early date. That has already been introduced in England and Wales. Councils are experiencing difficulties and unnecessary costs in running CCT and best value in tandem. We have made our point. The minister has given an undertaking that the Executive will bring forward detailed legislative proposals on best value this autumn. In view of that, we do not intend to oppose the bill, but we will look for the minister to deliver his promise.</p>

<p>A trend seems to have been set and I do not wish to break it.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I welcome the bill. It is a sensible technical measure to prevent local authorities having to go through an unnecessary exercise to prepare for competitive tendering, which will, I hope, be abolished later this year when best value comes in. I want to put in the <em>Official Report</em> that I did not support the Conservative amendment at stage 1, although I appeared to do so in the voting records. I fully support the Executive's intention to extend the moratorium and I support the bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2001-06-06.1266.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80162" speakername="Trish Godman (West Renfrewshire) (Lab)"  colnum="1266" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-01/sor0606-02.htm#Col1266" time="14:42:00">
<p>I rise in some pain, but not from listening to what has been said. I have a common complaint among members at the moment&mdash;leafleter's knee. By tomorrow at about 10 pm, I hope that it will all be over bar the counting and I can get my knee back into shape.</p>

<p>The bill is a technical one, but the nub of it is best value. I suppose that it could be argued that <place-holder colnum="1267"/> the Parliament has regard to best value at the moment because we are taking stages 2 and 3 together. That means that we are making proper use of officials' time, the official report's time and MSPs' time. The bill is necessary to extend the moratorium. Although I am being hassled from behind&mdash;by Hugh Henry in particular&mdash;to stop talking, I will finish what I have to say, which will take only a minute and a half.</p>

<p>At stage 1, Andy Kerr and Michael McMahon referred to concerns about the fact that local authority direct labour organisations and direct service organisations have to run CCT and the early days of best value in parallel. However, CCT and best value are incompatible and that would place a significant burden on the service providers. I am pleased that the minister has said that he will introduce a best-value bill in the autumn.</p>

<p>At stage 1, Pauline McNeill was concerned that the continuation of good salaries and conditions of service should be included in a best-value regime. I am sure that members of the Local Government Committee will take that on board when we consider the bill.</p>

<p>We are serious about the abolition of CCT and therefore we must be serious about getting best value right. It is critical to the delivery of services that we do much more. We trust local government to deliver best value, having regard to agreed priorities. All the key stakeholders that gave evidence to the Local Government Committee agreed that the way forward was to identify outcomes clearly, allowing service delivery performance indicators to be the criteria for awarding contracts, as Andy Kerr suggested.</p>

<p>Finally&mdash;Hugh Henry will be pleased to know that I am going to sit down in a moment&mdash;public services must be accountable, but they must also deliver. Best value is the way forward. I ask members to support the bill.</p>

<p>I am grateful for members' support and the many telling contributions that have been made to the debate. I am genuinely grateful for the support of Opposition parties and the fact that they did not oppose the bill, which is a necessary measure to continue the status quo of the moratorium on CCT. Keith Harding mentioned our promise. I undertake to deliver on our promise, as we always do on this side of the chamber.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Local Government Committee for its reasoned consideration of the bill and I would also like to thank the clerks and the other staff involved. This has not been the most taxing bill that we have considered. Nonetheless, all those people made a contribution <place-holder colnum="1268"/> to its steady progress.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the support of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Association for Public Service Excellence and the Scottish Construction Industry Group. They have all supported the measure that is before us today and we look forward to working closely with them as we develop our proposals for a replacement best-value regime. I want to pick up on Trish Godman's point: it is very important to get the replacement right, because doing so will lead to the proper use of public funds over a long period in the future.</p>

<p>I commend the bill to the chamber.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the March figures. Is the minister aware that, as of the end of February, only 11 per cent of all those who went through the new deal secured unsubsidised employment? That figure is well down on the original expectations for the new deal and it is certainly down on the expectations of young people. With that in mind, is the minister prepared to argue the case for this Parliament to have control over the new deal, so that resources can be redirected to suit the Scottish economy and to get a better deal for Scotland's young people?</p>

<p>I am certainly not prepared to argue that we should give up responsibility for the new deal after hearing from a party that is not even committed to the new deal. I remember that, four years ago, the SNP argued against our taxing the windfall profits of the privatised utilities to help people into employment, whether subsidised or unsubsidised. However, by doing that, we have reduced youth unemployment by more than three quarters in Scotland in the past four years.</p>

<p>Yes. The member has highlighted the hugely significant impact the new deal has made at local level. Four years ago, people simply believed that youth unemployment was a problem that was here to stay. In constituencies across Scotland, four out of five youngsters who were unemployed four years ago have now had the opportunity to go back to work, aided by the new deal and by the political courage that the Labour Party showed in taxing the windfall <place-holder colnum="1270"/> profits of the privatised utilities to make it possible.</p>

<p>We have funded record numbers of police officers in Scotland. Exactly how those officers are deployed is an operational matter for chief constables, but I know that those chief constables understand the benefits that can be obtained from visible policing. In addition, Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary will be undertaking a review of visible policing across Scotland.</p>

<p>Although I welcome extra police officers across Scotland, it is important that the additional numbers translate into officers walking the beat. I share the concerns of my constituents&mdash;particularly in Shotts and Harthill&mdash;who want to see more police officers walking their streets. Does the minister agree that we must ensure that the police force listens and responds to the concerns and fears of local communities and neighbourhoods?</p>

<p>Yes. It is certainly the case that our police forces should be policing in a way that meets the needs and aspirations of the communities that they serve. We set national performance targets for the police&mdash;Jim Wallace announced them relatively recently. Of course, it is easy to set national performance targets; the important thing is their delivery at a local level. I believe that police and communities have to engage locally to ensure that the people's priorities are met. The likeliest forums for that are the community safety partnerships, which allow crime prevention and community safety to be considered in their totality. That will allow issues such as closed-circuit television to be addressed. Of course, if specific concerns arise in Airdrie and Shotts, and Karen Whitefield wants to write to me, I would be happy to look into them.</p>

<p>Does the minister appreciate that visible policing is an alien concept to people in Grampian, given that the area gets the second-lowest level of police funding in the country, despite the fact that it has the highest rate of recorded crime in the country? Will the minister update the chamber and Grampian on what progress has been made on reviewing the funding formula for the police force in Grampian, so that we can have a better deal for Grampian and more visible policing?</p>

<p>The key piece of progress was that cognisance was taken of Grampian's historical position when the current financial year's police <place-holder colnum="1271"/> funds were agreed. However, we continue to work with police forces and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to examine how police funds should be distributed in future years.</p>

<p>On visible policing in Grampian, I return to the point that I made: it is important that local policing meets local needs. That will raise different issues in urban situations and rural situations and I look to a review by the chief inspectors to give us advice on how visible policing can be made a possibility throughout Scotland.</p>

<p>I agree up to a point. Our communities want results from their policing. If Bill Aitken examines the recently released safer Scotland drugs campaign, he will see that covert intelligence-gathering police work has produced visible results. The first eight weeks of covert enforcement resulted in the arrest of 3,490 people for drug offences, the charging of 847 people on drug supply charges and the seizure of drugs worth &#163;3.7 million. There is a debate to be had about the most effective way in which to deploy our police officers. That is what people want and we are delivering it.</p>

<p>We all look forward to reading the action plan, which will cover all forms of violence against women. Although we all welcome the allocation of &#163;18.4 million to address the problem of domestic violence, does the minister agree that it is important also to acknowledge links between all forms of violence against women, including rape and sexual assault, and to set aside appropriate funding to tackle them? What plans are there for a funding strategy to tackle those other forms of violence against women and are time scales attached to them?</p>

<p>I agree with Elaine Smith that domestic abuse is a problem, but not the only problem, when it comes to violence against women. We are pursuing policies on other aspects of the issue&mdash;for example, we are committed to <place-holder colnum="1272"/> legislating on those who give evidence in court in cases of rape and other sexual offences.</p>

<p>A key part of our approach is the national group to address domestic abuse in Scotland, which will be chaired by Margaret Curran, the Deputy Minister for Social Justice. The first group meeting is next week. The group has an interesting remit, which is to oversee strategic developments in relation to violence against women. Domestic abuse is a central part of the remit, so the group will examine closely our legislative and funding strategies. That process will begin imminently; indeed, it will begin next week.</p>

<p>Does the minister accept that in certain quarters of Scotland there is a regrettable, almost laddish, culture that pays scant respect to the well-being of women?

<p> Will the deputy minister consider additional funding for women's refuges in rural areas? For example, the only refuge in the Borders is in Jedburgh and to have several smaller units would undoubtedly be better. As funding is patchy and accessed from social work and housing budgets, will the minister consider conjoining the funding sources and ring-fencing those moneys?</p>

<p>We have a significant funding package for expanding the number of refuge places. Those funds will begin to play through and make a significant difference. Christine Grahame asked about ring-fencing funds that are disbursed through local government. Like many other issues, that question concerns the funding relationship between the Executive and local authorities. We will make it clear to local authorities that we expect the number of refuge places to be increased. The funding was calculated on the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities formula, so we are clear about the number of new places into which we expect it to translate.</p>

<p>I am sure that the Executive will note the success of many of those projects, as they have raised attainment and helped pupils across Scotland. I draw the minister's attention to Renfrewshire Council's looked-after children project and to pilot homework clubs that were held in three libraries. Funding for those new opportunities fund projects finished at the end of March. Will the minister reflect the success of projects run by Renfrewshire Council in future plans for the new opportunities fund?

<p>Although it would be inappropriate for me to get involved in an individual application to the new opportunities fund, I agree that it is important that projects that are established using new opportunities fund money have the chance to sustain their development. We need to look at that issue as we review our use of the excellence fund and the overall provision of out-of-school facilities.</p>

<p>A tremendous amount of good work is going on in Renfrewshire: the excellence fund is being used for study support in, I believe, 69 schools and good work is being done in the four NOF projects. It is important that those projects and clubs are sustained beyond 2002.</p>

<p>We have provided &#163;250,000 to carry out a <place-holder colnum="1275"/> national audit of all Scotland's museums. The audit is under way. It will establish the relative importance of museum collections, buildings and services and will inform spending from a fund of &#163;3 million over three years that is aimed at restructuring and stabilising the museum sector.</p>

<p>I am happy to provide the minister with further information. Does he agree that most people would find it extraordinary that, notwithstanding the audit, museums in Scotland are under greater threat than ever before? Indeed, many would argue that the audit is a seriously flawed and inadequate document. We are now two years into the first Scottish Parliament for 300 years and yet museums such as Duff House, described by the director general of the National Galleries of Scotland as a jewel in the crown of the north-east tourist industry, are under threat. Duff House is about to take receipt of a Botticelli valued in excess of &#163;10 million&mdash;</p>

<p>I am not sure which section of the question I should reply to. Is Irene McGugan still going on? Her question is typical of the sort of exchange that we expect from the Scottish nationalists. As the SNP is well aware, no member would expect me to comment on the specifics of the national audit until it is complete. It would be imbecilic to suggest otherwise. The questionnaires have been sent out and should be returned by 19 June. I expect the publication of the full results in the spring of next year.</p>

<p>Given that the Executive is encouraging cities such as Dundee to broaden the base of their local economies by developing strategies for sectors such as tourism, and given that the Verdant Works and RRS Discovery attractions are key to developing tourism in Dundee, does the minister accept that it would be entirely counterproductive not to secure the future of those key attractions by supporting with adequate subsidies the heritage trust that is responsible for them?</p>

<p>I agree with that sensible contribution from my colleague, John McAllion.

<p>Local authorities tell us that, during the first two years of the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995, energy efficiency was improved by 2.86 per cent and carbon dioxide emissions fell by 0.7 million tonnes. The benefits from HECA between 1997 and 1999 are set out in a report from the Executive, which was laid before Parliament on 22 May.</p>

<p>I thank the minister for her reply, but does she agree that, as well as the environmental benefits of energy efficiency, the savings in fuel costs to households are important?

<p>I am happy to give the member that assurance. I am sure that Trish Godman and other members will be aware of the deep discussions that we had at stage 2 of the Housing (Scotland) Bill&mdash;a bill that might take up slightly more time in the parliamentary timetable next week than we took this afternoon. As part of those discussions, we put considerable emphasis on fuel poverty and made clear our strong commitment to a range of measures on fuel poverty, which would of course include local authorities. We will make that a key part of local authority housing strategies. If members will excuse the pun, I will say that those measures were warmly welcomed by key organisations in the field and mark considerable progress on those matters.</p>

<p>Does the minister agree that an increase in fuel efficiency does not necessarily translate into fuel savings? The standard of insulation in our houses is so appalling that even when houses are insulated, people are likely simply to spend the same amount on fuel, in order to keep their houses nice and warm. How did local authorities arrive at the figure for carbon dioxide emissions that the minister mentioned?</p>

<p>Robin Harper was at the Social <place-holder colnum="1277"/> Justice Committee, where we had many discussions. I welcome his contribution&mdash;and that of his party&mdash;to the entire debate and to understanding throughout Scotland. It has been clear from those discussions that, to tackle fuel poverty, home insulation and the other problems that are involved in this matter, a range of initiatives and measures have to be undertaken. We have never implied that just one measure was needed.</p>

<p>We recognise that this is about income&mdash;we will work in partnership with Westminster on that&mdash;as well as housing strategy and local authorities. Our determination on this matter was perhaps best signalled by our commitment to the central heating programme, which has been strongly welcomed throughout Scotland. That indicates our determination to put substantial resources into the problem and to recognise its complexity. We will take every measure that we can to tackle home insulation issues and fuel poverty throughout Scotland.</p>

<p>It is customary to thank ministers for their reply, but I will just sympathise with that shabby response and ask the minister to apologise to our joint constituent, Sharon Gray of Broomhouse, who has learned today that she will wait 12 weeks before being seen at the Western general hospital.</p>

<p>I would like to hear the minister's comment on the leaflets that are supplied to cancer patients. In September 1998, the promise was:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will give you an appointment within two weeks of receiving your doctor's letter.&quot;</p>

<p>The latest one says that</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;there is sometimes a delay of a few weeks between seeing your General Practitioner and your appointment at the Breast Clinic.&quot;</p>

<p>Will the minister explain why, when the Chancellor announced in March &#163;85 million of extra spending for health in Scotland, that should be the case? We were also told that we could <place-holder colnum="1278"/> expect the cancer plan in March. Why have we not seen it yet and what has the Executive done with the Chancellor's money?</p>

<p>What Margo MacDonald got from me a minute ago was not a shabby reply, but an honest and factual one. That is what is merited for an issue as important and serious as this.</p>

<p>As someone who represents a Lothian constituency, I am deeply concerned by the performance in this particular service area within the national health service in Lothian. As I have indicated, Lothian's performance stands apart from performance throughout Scotland. I remind members that, whereas&mdash;sadly&mdash;women have recently had to wait a number of weeks in Lothian for that service, throughout Scotland the waiting time is between 48 hours and a maximum of about two weeks. That is as it should be. Lothian Health is acting on the issue and is targeting clinics in the area with additional investment of &#163;100,000 to bring about change. It is improving the referral systems and making real, practical changes in investment to deliver real results and improvement. I shall be monitoring the situation as closely as anyone in the weeks to come.</p>

<p>It is a pity that Margo MacDonald, who has a real concern about such matters, did not just stick to the real, sensitive issue. Instead, as ever, she tried to turn it into a political football.</p>

<p>If Tricia Marwick were to check the <em>Official Report </em> from a few weeks ago, I suspect that she would probably find that I said that this is not simply a question of cost; as with any drug or treatment, it is a matter of considering the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of any intervention. Every health care system in the world has to do that. We have to find systems, especially when modern medicine and technology are advancing by the day, of evaluating drugs and treatments to ensure that what we offer in the NHS in this country are the best interventions for all concerned.</p>

<p>As far as multiple sclerosis and beta interferon are concerned, as the member knows full well, measures have been put in place across the UK to assess beta interferon, through the National <place-holder colnum="1281"/> Institute for Clinical Excellence and the Health Technology Board for Scotland. It is right and proper that that is done in an effective way. It is right and proper that the best possible evidence and clinical advice is available to the NHS in Scotland. We will continue to take that work forward in a balanced and measured way.</p>

<p>I have said before&mdash;and will say again&mdash;that it comes strange for the SNP to lecture other parties in the chamber.

<p>The formula does indeed work to the benefit of the people of Scotland.

<p>I have been concerned to learn that the number of pupils who are studying for standard grade in technological studies has dropped significantly in recent years. That is why we have decided to focus from next year on a new, improved credit and general level course in technological studies and to drop the foundation level course in the subject. Pupils can then be directed towards other subjects in the technological mode that are more popular.</p>

<p>At the same time as there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of pupils taking technological studies, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of pupils taking subjects such as craft and design, which are technological <place-holder colnum="1285"/> in nature even though they do not have the word &quot;technological&quot; in their title.

<p>We expected rather more from the so-called leader of the Opposition in the way of an eve-of-poll attack.</p>

<p>We have a firm commitment to the future of older people in Scotland. That is why over the next three years we will spend record amounts on our national health service. That is why, on receipt of the development group's report in August, we will embark on free personal care for our older people. We want to implement that from April 2002.</p>

<p>We hope that the current dispute between the local authorities and the nursing home owners will be resolved in the weeks ahead. It is in no one's interests for older people in nursing homes or their relatives to be unsettled by the discussion on fees that is taking place. We have facilitated discussions between the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, nursing homes and local authorities. A settlement of the current dispute is in the interests of older people.

<p>The nationalists would commit a derisory amount of money to older people in the NHS. Furthermore, despite Mr Swinney's protestations to the contrary&mdash;he said that he would not spend unless the spend could be costed&mdash;the SNP has a national health service wish list that it will not own up to. Let us also be specific about this: the fiscal separation that the SNP talks about will destroy economic stability and inflict massive cuts on public services in Scotland. We have a nationalist party with empty promises and uncosted thinking. The older people of Scotland will be safe in our hands, not in the hands of the nationalists.</p>

<p>During the election campaign, the First Minister may have spoken to members of the public who are fed up with the fact that he does not give the Parliament any answers to the questions that we ask him. He talks about empty promises, but what about broken promises? The Labour manifesto from four years ago told us:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everyone is entitled to dignity in retirement.&quot;</p>

<p>Where is the dignity in the farce that is continuing over care for the elderly? Is it not time that the First Minister started standing for Scotland and delivering for the people of Scotland, instead of betraying them?</p>

<p>John Swinney moves effortlessly from being a gentleman to being Mr Angry again. We are not impressed by the rant that we get from the leader of the SNP.</p>

<p>Let us get down to the facts about billions of pounds of public expenditure. In 1997, the SNP earmarked a miserable &#163;35 million extra for the NHS, whereas the Labour party budgeted for an <place-holder colnum="1288"/> extra &#163;1.25 billion over the same period. The Labour party in Scotland is happy to agree with the Labour party at Westminster on spending a massive sum on the welfare of our older people&mdash;and there is more to come. We have an absolute commitment to personal care for the elderly, whereas the SNP plays politics. We want COSLA and the home owners to get together to resolve the issue of nursing homes. John Swinney is falling into the oldest political trap and is playing politics with the future of older people. It is a disgrace.</p>

<p>As we know, there are more patients waiting for treatment than there were in 1997 and 1999. Can the First Minister tell us why he is putting political dogma before the interests of patients and ruling out a partnership with the independent sector that has the potential to abolish NHS waiting lists within a year?</p>

<p> I am sure that the new Bavarian connection that is going to be developed between the Tories in Scotland and the Germans will be of some help to them in addressing the problems in the national health service.</p>

<p>The Conservatives are again raising the issue of spending on the NHS. We have just endured 18 years of the worst Tory Government in relation to public services. The Conservatives, along with the nationalists, are offering economic instability and massive cuts in public services amounting to &#163;20 billion. I do not think that the Tory party is in any position to lecture us on the future of public services. We have a formidable record on the health service, which is why tomorrow the people of the United Kingdom will give us five more years to make more progress.</p>

<p>The First Minister must stop mangling his facts. We have not just endured 18 years of a Tory Government; we have just endured four years of a Labour Government, and things are a heck of a sight worse, not better, as a <place-holder colnum="1289"/> consequence.</p>

<p>The First Minister must stop trying to blind us with statistics and wake up to the reality. The reality is that general practitioners are in revolt and threatening to quit the NHS. In the past three weeks, I have met people from all over Scotland who are campaigning to save their local hospitals and stop the centralisation of many of the services that they have enjoyed for years.</p>

<p>As Mr Swinney rightly points out, many of our nursing homes are, unfortunately, unable to care for elderly and vulnerable people because of the current rates of payment that they receive from local authorities. Is it not a fact that, far from being saved four years ago, the NHS today is in turmoil wherever one cares to look?</p>

<p>We are becoming quite used to general abuse of the health service from David McLetchie and John Swinney week in and week out. Once again, we see the right-wing alliance between the two Opposition parties. [ <em>Interruption.</em> ] I am pleased that the SNP's deputy leader is not here, because she got quite excited the last time I mentioned that.</p>

<p>The Conservatives would deliver economic instability and massive cuts in public services. We have delivered the biggest hospital-building programme that Scotland has seen&mdash;eight new hospitals&mdash;an investment of &#163;500 million and 1,500 more nurses and midwives over the next five years. We want to put that record to the country.</p>

<p>Where is Phil Gallie today? [MEMBERS: &quot;Winning in Ayr!&quot;] Phil Gallie had better enjoy his last day on the hustings, because the sad fact is that he will be spending the next two years in this chamber before he is ousted in 2003.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, the people will vote against the Tories' plan to make cuts of &#163;20 billion. They will vote for the party that created the national health service, remains proud of its achievements and has a massive sum of money to invest over the next five years.</p>

<p>Does the First Minister agree that opening up educational opportunities for children in Scotland is key to developing a successful and vibrant Scotland? He has outlined some of the steps that are being taken, but I ask him to give the vision of the Labour party for Scotland and indicate to the people of Scotland that the choice tomorrow is between a Labour party that is committed to, and will invest in, Scottish children and education and other parties that have no vision and no money to put their policies into practice.</p>

<p>I agree with Karen Gillon. People have a choice tomorrow between the nationalists' fiscal separatism as a smokescreen for separation and divorce and the cuts of &#163;20 billion that would loom large if a Conservative Government were ever elected.</p>

<p>We have achieved much. We are committed to spending more on education in real terms over the next three years, we are setting national priorities to improve standards in schools, we are reducing class sizes in primary schools, we have put in place 62 new community school projects and we have agreed a deal with our teachers that they deserve. That deal will provide stability and will link excellence in standards in the classroom to a fair deal for teachers, whom we value and who will be at the core of the drive towards improvement in the years that lie ahead.</p>

<p>I want to address just one of the Executive's policy objectives. For several years, Labour has had a commitment to cut class sizes to 30 or fewer in primaries 1, 2 and 3. The Labour party has claimed that it will do so before 31 August 2001. No teacher believes that that will happen as it would require the Executive to take more than 1,000 children off the register every week for the <place-holder colnum="1291"/> next 12 weeks. Will the First Minister come clean and say that the commitment will not be delivered by 31 August? Anything else is a fib.</p>

<p>We do not expect the nationalists to support anything that is in the interests of schoolchildren in Scotland. We are on track to achieve the commitment to which Mike Russell refers, and that will be very significant for Scottish schools, for parents and for children.

<p>The Executive is working closely with the Motorola task force to secure the best possible outcome for the workers who are affected by the plant's closure. The main aim of the task force is to minimise the economic impact of the closure. It is seeking to assist all employees to gain alternative employment within the shortest time frame possible.</p>

<p>The task force has been on site since 21 May on a 24-hours-a-day, five-days-a-week basis and has been providing both general information sessions for all staff and an on-site job shop. Agency services provided include those from the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency, the Inland Revenue and a whole host of others. The next meeting of the task force is on 11 June.</p>

<p>The Executive has invited the task force to bring forward proposals as a matter of urgency to facilitate access to training and further education opportunities for those experienced workers who wish to consider a career change to sectors that contain identifiable skills shortages.</p>

<p>Is the First Minister aware of the frustration, anger and disappointment that is being expressed by Motorola workers, with particular regard to their being unable to obtain assistance for training until they first secure a job? Does he accept that they are in a chicken-and-egg situation, in that money is not being made available for training until they get a job, but they cannot get a job until they get money for training? Will he and the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning intervene as a matter of urgency?</p>

<p>How much of the &#163;10 million that was allocated to the task force has already been spent or allocated, and what has it been spent on? The Executive said that it would do its bit; this is an <place-holder colnum="1292"/> opportunity for it to do so by sorting out this mess.</p>

<p>I agree with Alex Neil's thoughtful contribution in relation to the difficult experiences of Motorola workers. Intervention has already taken place and the matter will be resolved. The situation that Alex Neil described does not make sense for the work force and the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning is dealing with the specific point that he raised. On the &#163;10 million, if Alex Neil is satisfied, I would like to write to him explaining what has been spent, what remains to be spent and what we have spent the money on.</p>

<p>Can the First Minister assure me that when proposals are put to the Executive by the task force, he will consider sympathetically support for those employees of Motorola who are currently taking further education courses&mdash;and who will wish to continue them&mdash;especially in cases where finances are particularly tight because more than one individual in a household is affected?</p>

<p>Does the First Minister agree that the figures published last week, which showed a 13 per cent increase in applications to Scottish universities by Scottish students, demonstrate that Scottish students are voting with their feet in favour of the funding package provided by the Liberal Democrat-Labour partnership Executive, which has meant an end to tuition fees, the reintroduction of grants of up to &#163;2,000 and the fact that 99 per cent of all students will leave university with less debt than they would have under the present system?</p>

<p>That is the essential <place-holder colnum="1293"/> difference at the heart of education politics in Scotland. The coalition is delivering for students and universities in Scotland, and therefore it is delivering for the Scottish economy. There is no doubt that the abolition of tuition fees and the introduction of maintenance grants will help significantly.</p>

<p>We are also attracting students from the rest of the United Kingdom and from overseas. It is our aspiration to have the best university system in the world. Of course, as part of that aspiration, we must ensure that student support is made available.</p>

<p>Education remains a key issue and I have no doubt that it will be one of the key issues to dominate the election over the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>Does the First Minister accept that young people are concerned? Whatever he may choose to call the graduate endowment, it is seen by many potential undergraduates as a tax.

<p>If there is a disincentive to young people entering university education, it has not been measured in our figures. There is a significant increase in the number of students, which has been helped by the fact that tuition fees have been abolished and that 50 per cent of students will not pay the graduate endowment. It would help students if they got the right information from the nationalists and the Conservatives. The graduate endowment is not about deferred tuition fees&mdash;it is about the abolition of tuition fees.</p>

<p>I want to make an important point. Although the SNP may not like it, we are also introducing maintenance grants for students from low-income backgrounds. The combination of all that means that we have the best student package in the United Kingdom. The figures are up, and we warmly welcome them.</p>

<p>Although my motion was originally intended to be timed to coincide with mental health week in April, I am glad to present it to Parliament today.</p>

<p>The issues involved in my motion have been raised by a number of members, including Adam Ingram, Jamie McGrigor and David Davidson, in similar motions, questions and letters to successive ministers. We are looking for the inclusion of</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;severe and enduring mental illness&quot;</p>

<p>in the list of items that are exempted from prescription charges. For some time, that case has been pressed on a variety of grounds, but ministers have been unmoved. I will go over those grounds and highlight what has changed that should allow reconsideration.</p>

<p>Given that only a minority of people&mdash;probably only 10 to 15 per cent&mdash;who receive continuing treatment for severe and enduring mental illness do not receive free prescriptions, the financial impact on the national health service of providing free prescriptions across the board to such people would be negligible. However, if that were done, the impact on the affected individuals would be rather significant.</p>

<p>There is a lack of equality in the system in that <place-holder colnum="1297"/> free prescriptions are provided for people who have chronic physical illness, but not for people who have chronic mental illness. That contrast does not reflect well on a Government that seeks to reduce discrimination. Mental health is one of the three key areas that the Government is trying to tackle. Patients who have epilepsy or hypothyroidism receive free prescriptions. I cannot see any reason for the distinction between those illnesses and enduring and severe mental illness.</p>

<p>When the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care's predecessor wrote to me, he suggested that people who did not take their medication because they could not afford it&mdash;or for whatever other reason&mdash;could be hospitalised. That is not exactly a solution to the problem. It is not a reasonable alternative to the free provision of medication. The costs that are involved in hospitalising a patient for a day would be much more than the cost of providing the drugs for a whole year, but the costs that would be involved in hospitalising a patient for a day are far from the end of the story. Weeks&mdash;perhaps months&mdash;are required for the successful restabilisation of patients. Even then, continuing care in the community might be required, which is provided using psychiatric nursing. The cost of not providing free prescriptions greatly outweighs the cost of providing them.</p>

<p>Continuity of care in the community is of course required as an ideal, but the free provision of medication should be an essential part of that. The Millan report recommends that compulsory medication should be available for those who have mental illness and who receive their care in the community.</p>

<p>People who have enduring mental illnesses are at an increased risk of suicide. Medication is an obvious preventative measure. As I understand it, some mental illnesses have a 15 per cent lifetime risk of suicide. As I understand the research, for patients who have taken themselves off medication for a year, there is perhaps a fivefold increase&mdash;it may even be up to twentyfold&mdash;in the risk that they will commit suicide.</p>

<p>Under the Mental Health Act 1983, individuals who tend towards suicide cannot necessarily be sectioned. Whether they are sectioned is dependent on their communicating their feelings to somebody else. The problem cannot be identified until it has already happened.</p>

<p>Those arguments have been advanced in the past and have so far not persuaded successive ministers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/spor/2001-06-06.1297.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80145" speakername="Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con)"  colnum="1297" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-01/sor0606-02.htm#Col1297" time="15:49:00">
<p>Does Mr Adam agree with me that, because Scotland has a higher percentage of suicides per head of population than the rest of the <place-holder colnum="1298"/> UK, this is a singularly Scottish issue? Is not it a shame that, when the Minister for Health and Community Care replied to my question a few weeks ago, she said that she would not review prescription charge exemptions? Part of her answer indicated that she would work in parallel with the UK Government. Should not we try to overcome this difficulty in Scotland?</p>

<p>I agree with Mr Davidson. The matter is devolved and ministers have the right to act. Indeed, in response to previous questions, motions that I have lodged and letters that I have written, I have received a similar reply to that, which does not surprise me.</p>

<p>What has changed? The issue was reviewed in 1998 as part of the comprehensive spending review and it was turned down for the duration of the UK Parliament. That Parliament is at an end. Given that the issue was included for consideration as part of the comprehensive spending review, the principal case against it must be financial. The matter is devolved and I ask the minister to consider it for part of the additional unallocated funds from this year's comprehensive spending review, because mental health is one of the Government's three key areas for action.</p>

<p>The Millan committee concluded that essential medication for chronic mental conditions is fundamental to successful care in the community. The logical conclusion of that is to remove any barrier to compliance. By doing so, the logic of the case for making the prescriptions for severe and enduring mental illness free will be understood.</p>

<p>Many people who have severe and enduring mental illness are active participants in their communities. Some are in employment. If, for whatever reason, they stop taking their medication&mdash;because many are in poorly-paid employment&mdash;not only will society lose them, but we will lose the contribution that they can make to society. That is discrimination against a particular group of people who are already stigmatised. Perhaps we ought to consider whether we can make a separate&mdash;possibly Scottish&mdash;case for dealing with that, especially if the issue is largely financial, given that the financial costs are fairly small.</p>

<p>I do, indeed.</p>

<p>I congratulate Brian Adam on securing the debate today. It is unfortunate that it did not take <place-holder colnum="1299"/> place when he wanted it to. I understand the reasons for the debate. Many organisations in Grampian have written to him and to me as representatives of that area. Mental health support groups of all types are anxious to see movement on the issue.</p>

<p>We face a great difficulty. Many mentally ill people are capable of performing part-time work or, in some cases, poorly-paid work. They fall into the poverty trap because, if they are not on income support, they do not qualify for free prescriptions, unless they happen to have another illness such as diabetes or hypothyroidism.</p>

<p>In considering the matter, I asked the minister a few weeks ago for a total review. Mental health sufferers&mdash;possibly up to 20 per cent of the population&mdash;have a good case, but it is unfortunate that many other ailments are not covered by the motion.</p>

<p>I would go further and suggest that we need a review of the whole prescription charge exemption system. I do not want MSPs to play the needs of one interest group against those of another. People do not choose to be ill and they do not choose which illnesses to have. Some illnesses require much more medication, in different forms, than others do. I accept that there is an exemption where a drug&mdash;for example, chlorpromazine, a common drug for the treatment of mental illness&mdash;may be given in different doses and only one charge is made. However, the charges vary according to the drugs and many are very expensive. Some people cannot afford the prescription charge season ticket, which is a fairly major hit that must be paid up front.</p>

<p>As Brian Adam rightly said, medicine is only one part of care for the mentally ill&mdash;a large part is care in the community. It is surprising to find that 80 per cent of the funding for mental health is spent in the hospital service, yet 80 per cent of sufferers live in the community. I thoroughly approve of people being out of institutions where possible and if it is good for them, but such decisions are clinical decisions and are not for us to comment on.</p>

<p>I have received support in the form of a letter from the Royal College of General Practitioners to the Conservative health spokesperson. Although the RCGP welcomes the debate, it supports the position that I have stated previously. The RCGP comments:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;a wider debate on prescription charge reform is urgently required in Scotland ... The current system for prescription charging is outdated, inconsistent and illogical. Some long-term conditions entitle sufferers to blanket free prescriptions for all their medications&quot;.</p>

<p>That is regardless of whether the prescriptions relate to a patient's life-threatening disease. All the GPs and people working in mental health that I <place-holder colnum="1300"/> have spoken to agree that we need a review.</p>

<p>As I said to Mr Adam, it is within this Parliament's gift to carry out that review. It is important that we are talking about mental health, because no family in Scotland does not recognise the problems of the range of mental health conditions. It falls upon members to decide whether there should be a review. I would like the minister and his colleagues to come forward with the offer of a review so that the Parliament, through its committees and through debates in the chamber, can consider a proper, thorough and fair examination of who should receive free prescriptions.</p>

<p>I said previously that the system is unfair. As I know from my past as a community pharmacist, that unfairness is manifested when people come to a pharmacist with a prescription for multiple items, for which they have to pay, and say, &quot;I can only afford two out of the five. Which ones should I have?&quot; We cannot continue to tolerate that in the 21<sup>st</sup> century in Scotland.</p>

<p>I would like to endorse much of what Mr Davidson has said, and I would like to thank my colleague Brian Adam for securing this debate. It is just a pity that more of our colleagues are not present. Perhaps other business is in the offing.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of attendance, I am sure that those who rely on medication as part of their care package will be heartened by the fact that we are discussing such a motion in Parliament. Both the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Scottish Association for Mental Health have intimated their support for this motion to me, as convener of the cross-party group on mental health.</p>

<p>As I have said before, prescriptions for medication can be a vital component of the care programme. That has been reinforced by many of the recommendations in the Millan report. The report noted that:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has been the stated aim of Government that the reduction in hospital places would be accompanied by a transfer of resources to community based mental health services, although we received evidence from many quarters that neither service was adequately resourced. Together with changes in medication, these developments mean that it is now possible for many more people, even with severe mental illnesses, to live with support in the community.&quot;</p>

<p>My main concern with the current system is the basis set for exemption. I have previously raised parliamentary questions, as have other colleagues, on eligibility for exemption. The minister stated that she would not be reviewing the current criteria for conditions that they<place-holder colnum="1301"/></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;should be easily recognisable, lifelong and life-threatening&quot;.&mdash;<citation id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-05-15.S1W-15512.r0">[<em>Official Report, Written Answers,</em> 15 May 2001; p 184.]</citation></p>

<p>I would argue that many people with a mental illness could be covered by those criteria and that exemption from prescription charges should be conferred on them. The Government surely must review the current list of medical conditions that are eligible for exemption. To my knowledge, the list has not changed since it was drawn up in 1968. Since then, much has changed in society, in the medical profession and in pharmaceuticals. In particular, much has changed in diagnoses and the number of new conditions has increased.</p>

<p>Costs of medication for people who have enduring mental illness can range from just &#163;2 per week to &#163;28 per week. I will cite the cases of two of my constituents. One suffers from clinical depression and has to pay &#163;31.90 every four months. Another suffers from manic depression and has to pay &#163;30.15 every two months. Both are in full-time employment and therefore do not qualify for free prescriptions. Those people already have the anxiety of their illness; they do not need the added pressure of financing their medication. Those examples clearly show a disincentive to take up work opportunities, which runs counter to the Executive's social inclusion agenda.</p>

<p>The Executive has assured the people of Scotland that mental health is one of the three key health priority areas. That has to be reflected in the levying of prescription charges. The Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 has been reviewed, and the subject of charging patients on long-term medication was highlighted as an area that should be reassessed. The minister has the opportunity to make changes and the power to extend exemptions on prescription charges. I urge him to take that opportunity and the necessary steps to extend exemptions.</p>

<p>I had not intended to speak, but this is an important debate. Like Adam Ingram, I regret that there are not more members here. The issue of chronic illness and how prescriptions and medication are paid for deserves review, although I do not wish to judge individual cases at the moment.</p>

<p>I am diabetic and I get all my prescriptions for free, but I do not need them all to be free. I get things free that I would be perfectly happy to pay for. Health problems that are chronic and lifelong, and which have a chronic need for medication, should be serious candidates&mdash;regardless of whether they are mental or physical health problems&mdash;for free prescriptions.<place-holder colnum="1302"/></p>

<p>I hope that the minister will keep the issue under review. I agree with almost everything that members have said, including the fact that this is an area that is worthy of discussion. The idea of a review ought not to be put aside.</p>

<p>I congratulate Brian Adam on securing this debate which, in the wording of the motion, brings together several topics, including mental health week, suicide, the Millan report and prescription charges. I begin by assuring Adam Ingram that mental health is one of our three priorities, and we are proceeding with a wide-ranging agenda on it, one part of which, the Millan report, has been referred to on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>I read the report right through earlier this year, and the only reference that I can recall to the subject under debate today was in relation to those who are compelled to accept treatment. The Millan committee felt that medication ought to be free for those people. I cannot give an Executive response to that report, because currently we are considering it with a wide-ranging reference group, which includes users and carers. That group is helping us to work through some of the issues. There will be a statement on that later this year, and a new mental health bill will follow next year.</p>

<p>Brian Adam tried to connect prescription charges with mental health, and I understand and share his concerns, but the reality is that many people with various physical illnesses might well put forward exactly the same case, which is the point that David Davidson made. That highlights the fact that this is a complex issue, which has to be considered carefully. Change would be a major exercise, and it should be remembered that we are in the middle of a much wider programme of change and development in the health service and community care. In view of that, we do not regard reviewing the prescription charge arrangements as a priority at present.</p>

<p>I know that some groups have raised the issue of prescription charges, but in my contacts with mental health groups, and user groups in particular, it has not been at the top of their agendas. We also found that to be the case in our consultations on the health plan last year. While we acknowledge the concerns, we have to retain a sense of perspective on prescription charges. For example, the 1.6 per cent increase in prescription charges this year was the lowest for 20 years. We should remember that the charges bring in &#163;45 million for the national health service. People have to reflect on the hole that would be made in NHS finances if there were free prescription charges for chronic mental illness, although I accept that they <place-holder colnum="1303"/> have not been arguing for that particular position today.</p>

<p>I recognise that &#163;45 million is a not inconsiderable sum, but will the minister accept that exemption of the group that the motion mentions would involve a much smaller amount of money? If free prescriptions were extended, the amount affected could be counterbalanced by reduced costs, particularly in hospitalisation, and even in care in community.</p>

<p>That is the case for mental health exclusively, but I make the point that many people would not regard it as fair to except only one category. That is the point that David Davidson made.</p>

<p>When medical exemptions were introduced in 1968, only 42 per cent of national health service prescriptions were dispensed free, whereas that figure now is 90 per cent. We can reflect that the majority of people receive free prescriptions.</p>

<p>A pre-payment certificate is available to cover all prescriptions for four months for &#163;31, so I am unsure why the constituent to whom Adam Ingram referred should pay &#163;31 for two months' prescriptions.</p>

<p>The issue was connected to the serious problem of suicide. It was unfortunate that it was perhaps implied that the high rate of suicide was somehow connected to prescription charges. No evidence for that exists. We should also reflect that not everyone who commits suicide has recent experience of mental health services. The confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide that was produced earlier this year showed that 25 per cent of those who had committed suicide had had recent contact with mental health services.</p>

<p>We take suicide seriously. I read the most recent annual report of the Mental Welfare Commission, which highlights the problem. The Executive is committed to developing a framework for the prevention of suicide and self-harm as an urgent priority. I have been pleased to speak at two major seminars on the topic in the past few months. The most recent took place in Dunblane a couple of weeks ago, when we considered the draft framework. I thank the Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health for undertaking much of the work on that. The draft framework is being revised in the light of comments and we will issue the framework for consultation shortly. Work on preventing suicide encompasses the promotion of mental health and well-being and the development of services. Those are the two substantial parts of our mental health agenda.</p>

<p>The motion refers to mental health week. Every April, the World Health Organisation holds a mental health day. Scottish mental health week takes place every October and is run by the Health <place-holder colnum="1304"/> Education Board for Scotland. It seeks to raise awareness about mental health and helps to tackle the fear and stigma that are often associated with it. Concerted action to deal with stigma is also a major priority for us. I know that the cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament on mental health will welcome that, which is part of our wider work on promoting mental health and well-being. From the health improvement fund, &#163;4 million has been set aside for that work in the next three years. Detailed announcements will be made about what will be done.</p>

<p>I must refer to the service agenda, which complements the promotion agenda, as our health plan said in December. We are accelerating the implementation of the framework for mental health services and have given an extra &#163;2 million this year for projects that are directly linked to it. About a year ago, we established the mental health and well-being support group, which will ensure that the framework is implemented throughout Scotland.</p>

<p>We also said in the health plan that</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;severe and enduring mental illness is only the tip of the iceberg&quot;.</p>

<p>We seek to extend mental health services in primary care for the wider range of people who can suffer mental health problems at some point.</p>

<p>At least one speaker mentioned employment. Developing employment opportunities for those with mental health problems is critical, and the new futures fund helps in that. Two weeks ago, I was pleased to open a project in Aberdeen that is run by Rehab Scotland. It was a superb demonstration of good practice in working on employment issues with those with mental health problems.</p>

<p>My time is up and I know that Brian Adam will not be pleased with what I said about prescription charges. However, I hope that he will note the points that I made about them and that he will welcome the broader mental health initiatives that we seek to drive forward.<place-holder time="16:15:00"/></p>
