<p>I want to make it clear that I believe in the sovereignty of the people of Scotland rather than in the sovereignty of any monarch. My allegiance, therefore, is to the people of Scotland.

<p>Before making the affirmation, I would like to declare that as a democratically elected socialist, my vision for Scotland is of a democratic socialist republic, where the supreme sovereignty lies with the people of Scotland, not with an unelected monarch. I therefore make this affirmation under protest. </p>

<p>We are indebted to the clerks, who have been masters of efficiency throughout this long and difficult day. <i>[Applause.]</i><place-holder colnum="5"/></p>

<p>I have the opportunity to make a short speech and I want to begin with the words that I have always wanted either to say or to hear someone else say: the Scottish Parliament, which adjourned on 25 March 1707, is hereby reconvened. </p>

<p><i> [Applause.] </i> </p>

<p>I could not say those words until all members had been sworn and the Parliament really had been convened. </p>

<p>This is an historic day and, after a long time in politics, I am aware that we owe a debt to many who are not here, who did not live to see the promised land. I would like to mention a few people from across the parties: Arthur Donaldson, Robert McIntyre, Alick Buchanan-Smith, Johnny Bannerman, Emrys Hughes, John Mackintosh and John Smith-today is the fifth anniversary of his death. I would also like to mention my colleague Allan Macartney, who so nearly lived to see the day. There are many others, but I have been able to mention only the people who have been my friends. Many people are named in the history books; many are not, but all of them have made this moment in history possible. I give my thanks to every one of them. </p>

<p>As everyone knows, I have been a member of two Parliaments. I spent eight years in the House of Commons and I have spent 23 years in the European Parliament-which does not sound so long if it is said quickly. Until July, I will be the mother of the European Parliament. I hasten to add that I am not the oldest member of that Parliament, although I am the oldest one here, which is very disconcerting-I think they must have made a mistake on my birth certificate. </p>

<p>I have several practical and sincere hopes for the Parliament. The first is that we try to follow the more consensual style of the European Parliament and say goodbye to the badgering and backbiting that one associates with Westminster. </p>

<p>Secondly, in the House of Commons, I found that there was a Speaker's tradition of being fair to minorities. I am an expert in being a minority-I was alone in the House of Commons for three years and alone in the European Parliament for 19 years-but we are all minorities now, and I hope that the Presiding Officer, whoever that may be, will be fair to each and every one of us. </p>

<p>My next hope is that this Parliament, by its mere existence, will create better relations with England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I believe that to be in the hearts of the peoples of all of those countries. </p>

<p>My last practical hope is that everyone who was born in Scotland, some of whom, like me, could not help it, and everyone who chose Scotland as their country, will live in harmony together, enjoying our cultures but remaining loyal to their <place-holder colnum="6"/> own. </p>

<p>In Europe and in the wider world, there is a bank of good will towards Scotland. I was privileged to visit 28 third-world countries as a member of my third world committee. I met many heads of state of struggling countries with problems who asked what was taking the Scots so long. I know that there will be a great deal of good will from all those countries. </p>

<p>I have served on the Lom&eacute; assembly, which is made up of the European Parliament plus half of the world. One of our proudest moments was when Lom&eacute; came to Inverness and we agreed the declaration of Inverness, which became part of international law. In that declaration, we swept away the last vestiges of apartheid. Thus, we played a constructive role on the international stage, earning the admiration of everyone who attended the assembly, from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. </p>

<p>On behalf of my party, I pledge to make this Parliament work. All of us here can make it work-and make it a showpiece of modern democracy. It is no secret that, to members of the Scottish National party, this Parliament is not quite the fulfilment of our dream, but it is a Parliament we can build a dream on. Our dream is for Scotland to be as sovereign as Denmark, Finland or Austria-no more, no less. However, we know that that dream can come true only when there is total consensus among the people of Scotland, and we accept that. </p>

<p>I will end by quoting from the debate of 1707. I have chosen a passage by Lord Belhaven, who was an opponent of the treaty: </p>

<p>"Show me a spurious patriot, a bombastic fire-eater, and I will show you a rascal. Show me a man who loves all countries equally with his own and I will show you a man entirely deficient of a sense of proportion. But show me a man who respects the rights of all nations while ready to defend the rights of his own against them all and I will show you a man who is both a nationalist and an internationalist." </p>

<p>It was said that 1707 was the end of an auld sang. All of us here can begin to write together a new Scottish song, and I urge all of you to sing it in harmony-fortissimo. <i>[Applause.]</i> </p>

<p>We shall now break for lunch, which is welcome news. As all members have been sworn, we will resume at 2.30 pm, when the voting period for the election of the Presiding Officer will commence. The nomination period for Presiding Officer runs from 12.30 pm to 2.15 pm.</p>

<p> The election shall proceed in accordance with rule 11.9 of the standing orders of the Parliament. Members should wait in their seats until a clerk indicates to them that they should collect their ballot paper from the back of the chamber. Two tables have been set up for this purpose. The table on my left-hand side should be used by members with surnames beginning with the letters A to M-but not Mc or Mac-while the table on my right-hand side should be used by members whose surnames begin with Mc, Mac or the letters N to Z. Members should give their names to the clerk, who will hand them a ballot paper. Members should then proceed to one of the four voting booths, where they should vote by marking an X on the ballot paper. Members should then put the folded ballot paper in the ballot box, which is situated in the well of the chamber, before returning to their seats. </p>

<p>Each candidate can nominate one scrutineer to monitor the counting of votes. Will candidates ensure that the name of their scrutineer is notified to the clerks at the tables at the back of the chamber at the time that they collect their ballot paper. I shall announce the names of the scrutineers and invite them to the vote counting table in the well of the chamber at the end of the voting period. </p>

<p>On a point of order, Dr Ewing. Will you give us guidance on whether we can have an open, recorded vote rather than a secret ballot? We have waited for our first Scottish Parliament for nearly 300 years-indeed, this is our first ever democratically elected Scottish Parliament-and the Parliament was supposed to herald a new era of open democracy, but our first vote is to be a secret one. That seems rather strange. Surely we should behave like an <place-holder colnum="8"/> open democracy, rather than a secret society. </p>

<p>I realise that we are operating under draft standing orders, which were handed to us by a statutory instrument of the House of Commons. As I understand it, there was little, if any, debate on that statutory instrument in the House of Commons. I have been critical of the way in which things are done there, but even in the House of Commons there is an open, recorded vote on every occasion, including the election of the Speaker. Would you be prepared to accept, from me, a motion that we have an open recorded vote rather than a secret ballot on this important, historic, first vote of our first ever democratically elected Scottish Parliament? </p>

<p> My heart is with you, but the standing orders are against you. At the moment, I will obey the standing orders. If there is any other person who wants to say that we should not obey the standing orders, perhaps they should enter the discussion now. </p>

<p>There is no one else so, Dennis, while my heart is with you, the standing orders have to settle the matter for now. Perhaps in future we can reform ourselves. </p>

<p>The voting in this round is now closed. </p>

<p>Please will the following members come to the well of the chamber to scrutinise the counting of the ballot papers: Mr Colin Campbell for Mr George Reid, and Margaret Smith for Sir David Steel. </p>

<p>In the election for the position of Presiding Officer, the total number of votes that were cast for each candidate was: <br /> <table width="100%"> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="16%">Mr George Reid</td> <td valign="TOP" width="84%">44</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="16%">Sir David Steel</td> <td valign="TOP" width="84%">82</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="16%">Abstentions</td> <td valign="TOP" width="84%">3</td> </tr> </table> </p>

<p><i>[Applause.]</i></p>

<p>Accordingly, as Sir David Steel received more votes than the total number of votes received by all other candidates, and since more than 25 per cent of the members voted, Sir David Steel is elected as the first Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. </p>

<p>Before I invite Sir David to take the chair, Mr Reid would like to say a few words of <place-holder colnum="9"/> congratulation. </p>

<p> I thank members for the honour and the responsibility which I have been given. I undertake to set aside party affiliation and to be the servant of the whole Parliament. </p>

<p>Last week, William McIlvanney, in a poem, talked about the Scottish lion becoming a kitten again, which must be cherished. We must cherish this Parliament. This is the start of a new sang. </p>

<p>The elections for the positions of Deputy Presiding Officer will take place in the chamber at 3:40 pm. Members who wish to make nominations for either or both positions of Deputy Presiding Officer should pick up nomination papers from the clerk in my office on the first floor of the Assembly Hall. </p>

<p>Nomination papers must be signed by the nominee, the member nominating and the seconder. Completed papers must be handed to one of the clerks in my office not later than 15 minutes before the time I have set for the vote. In other words, there can be no nominating within 15 minutes of the vote. Members may nominate from 3:10 pm. </p>

<p> The election will proceed in accordance with rule 11.9 of the standing orders. I do not need to read that out, as it describes the same procedure that we have just followed-members will not have forgotten it already. Candidates should each nominate a scrutineer to monitor the counting of the votes; they should notify the clerks at the back of the chamber of their scrutineer when they collect their ballot papers. At the end of the voting period, I shall announce the names of the scrutineers and invite them to the vote-counting table in the well of the chamber. </p>
