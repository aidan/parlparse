	<p pid="a.141WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-18">18 January</phrase> this year, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-01-18.933"><i>Official Report</i>, column 933</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport announced that, from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, the fee for a colour television licence would rise to &pound;135.50 and the black and white licence fee to &pound;45.50. I am today laying before the House the regulations necessary to bring these new fees into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.1/2">The regulations include a number of minor amendments to address anomalies in the existing television licence fee regulations. The amendments include provisions to ensure a digital set top box installed or used solely in conjunction with a black and white television set or a monitor that is only able to display black and white images will need only a black and white TV licence; that a digital set top box installed in such a way that it can be used for audio output only does not require a TV licence; that the Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concession is available to retired people aged 60 or over and disabled people in short term respite care in nursing and residential homes; and to increase the fee for the ARC licence, which has remained unchanged since 1988, from &pound;5 to &pound;7.50 to cover the cost of administering the concession.</p>

	<p pid="a.141WS.4/1">I am pleased to be able to announce to the House today the outcome of a wide-ranging review of Gurkha Terms and Conditions of Service, which was announced by the then Secretary of State for Defence in January 2005. This has been a very comprehensive review and as a consequence it has taken longer than was originally anticipated.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.4/2">As the House is aware, it has been the policy of successive British Governments to ensure that the terms and conditions under which Gurkhas serve in the British Army remain fair and reflect the needs of Gurkha soldiers and their families. The Gurkhas became a UK-based Brigade on <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> and the time is now right for their terms and conditions of service to be revised fully to reflect their role and status in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.4/3">As a result of this review I am pleased to announce that, with certain exceptions designed to satisfy the Government of Nepal, all the remaining differences between Gurkhas' terms and conditions of service and those of their British counterparts are to be eliminated. I am making arrangements necessary to ensure that members of the British Brigade of Gurkhas retain their distinctive identity and ethos as Nepalese citizens serving in their own units within the British Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.4/4">The measures necessary to implement the new terms and conditions of service will begin to take effect from April 2007. In the particular case of pensions, we propose to give serving Gurkhas the opportunity to transfer from their current Gurkha pension scheme to one of the two armed forces pension schemes (AFPS), from a planned member transfer date of <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2007</phrase>. Retired Gurkhas who left service on or after <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> will also be given the opportunity to access AFPS benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.4/5">This is good news, both for serving or recently retired Gurkhas and their families and for the British Army. The move to new and fairer terms and conditions of service will hopefully provide the basis for the foreseeable future of Gurkha service in the British Army, which is only made possible by the long-standing and friendly relations between the Governments and peoples of the United Kingdom and Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.4/6">The review did not include consideration of the situation of Gurkha veterans who retired before <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>, for the reasons which my predecessor made clear to the House last summer. We will continue to respond to veterans grievances with a view to resolving any misunderstandings which may have arisen.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.4/7">A copy of the report of the review of Gurkha terms and conditions of service, which has been redacted so as not to disclose privileged legal advice, will be made available in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.142WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-22">22 November 2005</phrase>,1 announced in the House of Commons that a review of the arrangements currently in place for the seasonal influenza programme in England would be carried out. This review has now been completed and published today. A copy of the review has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/2">The review details the current seasonal influenza vaccine supply system in England and provides a range of recommendations to strengthen the management of the programme. I welcome the report and commend the reviewers for such a thorough piece of work. The Department will be considering the detailed recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/3">I would also like to provide details of this year's seasonal influenza vaccination uptake. Despite reported delays to the distribution of influenza vaccine at the start of the programme, by the middle of December 14.6 million doses of vaccine had been distributed in the UK. This is about 900,000 doses more than in the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/4">Final vaccine uptake data collected by the Health Protection Agency on behalf of the Department at the end of January 2007 show that vaccine uptake in those aged 65 and over was 74 per cent. comparable to the level of 75 per cent. achieved at the same time last year. This compares with the World Health Organisation target of 75 per cent. by 2010. Vaccine uptake in those under 65 in an at-risk group was 42 per cent. compared to 48 per cent. at the same time last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/5">These levels of vaccination represent an excellent achievement by the general practitioners, nurses, health service providers and primary care organisations that deliver this service, especially when taking into consideration the fact that vaccine deliveries were delayed by several weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.146WS.2/1">For many years the drafting of primary legislation has relied on section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1978, under which words referring to the masculine gender include the feminine. In practice this means that male pronouns are used on their own in contexts where a reference to women and men is intended, and also that words such as chairman are used for offices capable of being held by either gender. Many believe that this practice tends to reinforce historic gender stereotypes and presents an obstacle to clearer understanding for those unfamiliar with the convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.146WS.2/2">I have worked with colleagues in Government to secure agreement, that it would be right, where practicable, to avoid this practice in future and, accordingly, Parliamentary Counsel has been asked to adopt gender-neutral drafting.</p>
	<p pid="a.146WS.2/3">From the beginning of next Session, Government Bills will take a form which achieves gender-neutral drafting so far as it is practicable, at no more than a reasonable cost to brevity or intelligibility. This policy already applies to tax law rewrite Bills and is consistent with the practice in many other jurisdictions in the English-speaking world.</p>
	<p pid="a.146WS.2/4">The Government recognise that, in practice, Parliamentary Counsel will need to adopt a flexible approach to this change (for example, in at least some of the cases where existing legislation originally drafted in the former style is being amended).</p>
	<p pid="a.146WS.2/5">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Meg Munn MP) for raising this matter with me.</p>
