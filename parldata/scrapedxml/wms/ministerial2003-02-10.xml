	<p>The Chairman of the FSA is a critical appointment. The Treasury will be looking for an exceptional individual to lead the FSA in delivering its statutory objectives and a strong, fair and effective regulatory system in the UK.</p>
	<p>As the single financial services regulator in the UK, the scope and responsibilities of the FSA are considerable. The work of the FSA will increase significantly when it takes on responsibility for mortgages and general insurance conduct of business regulation in 2004&ndash;05.

	<p>I am publishing a document today that sets out the Government's agenda for secondary education and responds to the discussions that Education Ministers had with over 2000 secondary school headteachers who attended a series of conferences before Christmas. Copies of the document will be placed in the Library later today.</p>
	<p>Our strategy is built around the collaborative system of specialist schools which I extended as an offer to all schools when speaking in the House on 28 November last year. Increasingly groups of specialist schools will be able to provide co-ordinated partnerships across their local areas, sharing the resources and expertise of their various specialisms.</p>
	<p>I am designating today a further 217 schools in the specialist schools programme, the highest ever number, and within the policy document on secondary education I am including information on a number of developments that respond to the autumn conferences:</p>
	<p class="indent">There will be two new specialisms in the specialist school programme: music and humanities. The latter will enable schools to select three subjects for their specialist focus built around one of English, history or geography.</p>
	<p class="indent">We will also introduce the option of a rural focus within appropriate specialisms.</p>
	<p class="indent">Special schools will be given a new opportunity to use their expertise in helping mainstream schools to tackle special needs issues.</p>
	<p class="indent">Headteachers at the conferences liked the collaborative messages in the criteria and specification for the 'Advanced' schools programme but did not like the suggestion in the title that there would be a new hierarchy of schools. We have decided that schools successful in their applications to join this programme will not be called 'Advanced' schools. The programme will be renamed the Leading Edge Programme and to emphasise its collaborative nature, the schools themselves will not acquire a new title.</p>
	<p>Our strategy document stresses the central importance of a clear focus on teaching and learning. This is indeed central to the specialist schools programme. We want our policies to energise all of the profession and we want to see better opportunities for teachers to build on their natural enthusiasm for their chosen curriculum subjects. Building on schools' impressive achievements in recent years, we will be seeking to increase the autonomy of school leaders as we trust the professionalism of the workforce to deliver on our ambitious programme for a step change in the standards achieved by secondary education.</p>

	<p>I am pleased to announce that the Government's new strategic framework for the public library service&mdash;<i>&quot;Framework for the Future&quot;&mdash;</i>has been published today and copies of the document have been placed in the Libraries of both houses.</p>
	<p>The starting point for the strategy is how best to meet the needs of library users and encourage new users. &quot;<i>Framework for the Future</i>&quot; outlines a range of initiatives designed to promote reading and learning for everyone&mdash;giving special attention to those who have literacy problems. It aims to bring access to the digital communications revolution to all and to help communities work together more effectively through better sharing of community information and by creating opportunities for different groups to work together. The new strategy will encourage libraries to build on existing strengths and ensure they position themselves at the heart of the communities they serve.</p>
	<p>Public libraries are a valuable infrastructure, which have the potential to help local authorities deliver across a range of local services. The best libraries are doing so already. By clarifying key priorities and highlighting best practice, &quot;<i>Framework for the Future</i>&quot; provides a focus for future work across the sector. It provides a basis for authorities to prioritise and plan services to meet the needs of citizens&mdash;while being flexible enough to respond to local differences.</p>
	<p>The launch of the policy document marks the beginning of the next stage in developing the strategy. We will be working closely with the Advisory Council on Libraries, Resource: The Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries and leaders in local government, libraries and education to deliver the strategy.</p>
	<p>The document will also be available on the DCMS website at <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/heritage/pl-framework.html">http://www.culture.gov.uk/heritage/pl-framework.html</a></p>

	<p>on 21 February 2000, the Government announced its conclusions on the recommendations of the independent review panel on the future funding of the BBC. In addition to a range of measures designed to improve BBC efficiency and accountability, the Government introduced a new funding formula providing for changes in the licence fee of RPI plus 1.5 per cent. for each year from 2000&ndash;01 to 2006&ndash;07. This formula will enable the BBC to provide a strong and distinctive schedule of high quality programmes and remain at the forefront of broadcasting technology.</p>
	<p>Application of the RPI figure of 1.7 per cent. for the year to September 2003, plus 1.5 per cent., to the current unrounded licence fees produces new rounded totals of &pound;116.00 for a colour licence and &pound;38.50 for a black and white licence. The necessary regulations to bring these fees into force will be laid before the House in due course. These changes will come into effect from 1 April 2003.</p>

	Planning Delivery Grant

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-02-10.35WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1082" speakername="Tony McNulty" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister" colnum="35WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030210/wmstext/30210m01.htm#30210m01.html_spmin5">
	<p>In July the Deputy Prime Minister announced that we would be making an additional &pound;350m available to local authorities over the period 2003&ndash;06 to improve the delivery of planning services. We have now decided the basis on which we will distribute this new Planning Delivery Grant in 2003&ndash;04 and will be informing recipients of their allocations.</p>
	<p>The grant is being paid out of additional resources from Spending Review 2002. The aim of the grant is to improve the planning system to ensure the effective delivery of our objectives for sustainable communities which we set out in the document &quot;Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future&quot;. It is specifically targeted towards meeting the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Public Service Agreements 5 and 6. PSA 5 aims to achieve a better balance between housing availability and demand. PSA 6 requires all authorities to have local development frameworks in place (in accordance with agreed Local Development Schemes) and to meet the Best Value development control targets by the end of 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p>The amount of grant distributed in 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;50 million. It will be paid to local planning authorities, regional planning bodies and the Greater London Authority. The grant is a performance reward grant, and rewards local authorities both for improvement towards and achievement of Best Value development control targets in the period June 2001 to June 2002. Those meeting the development control handling targets both at the start and the end of the year are rewarded separately for consistently high performance. No authority will receive an allocation of less than &pound;75,000 in 2003&ndash;04 so that every authority has additional resources to help drive improvement in performance towards the targets. The grant allocations are enhanced for those local authorities within the high housing demand and growth areas identified in the document &quot;Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future&quot;.</p>
	<p>Regional Planning Bodies were notified in December of their share of the &pound;6 million of existing funding which will, from 2003&ndash;04, be paid directly to them. They will also receive a share of the new Planning Delivery Grant for their work on new regional spatial strategies (due to replace regional planning guidance under the Bill) and their review of existing regional planning guidance to take account of the growth area proposals. The Greater London Authority receives grant to assist their related review of elements of the London Plan.</p>
	<p>County Councils will not receive direct resources from the grant. The counties' planning functions are being changed under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill currently before Parliament. Subject to Royal Assent, County Councils will cease to have a duty to prepare structure plans but their resources will not be reduced accordingly. Therefore, while in some cases counties may need to continue with structure plan preparation over the next year and possibly beyond, given the transitional period set out in the Bill, as this function winds down they will be able to take advantage of freed up resources. It will be important that these freed up resources, and the expertise available in county councils, are retained and used to deliver other county planning responsibilities and to undertake their function as statutory consultees in the preparation of regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks. Counties can be engaged to conduct work related to regional spatial strategies on an agency basis.</p>
	<p>The criteria for grant allocations have been designed to drive up performance in the delivery of planning functions, both in respect of development control and plan making. Authorities should be aware that they will need to continue to secure improvements in performance in order to receive money in further years. Grant allocations are not ring-fenced and authorities have complete discretion in the way they spend this money. Areas that authorities may consider concentrating on include: contributing to the preparation of regional planning guidance and the future regional spatial strategies; completing current reviews of existing development plans and preparing for the new system of local development frameworks; better resourcing of IT systems; assistance from consultants; outsourcing of certain planning services; increasing staffing levels; training for staff and councillors; supporting mediation services; encouraging a more diverse planning workforce; bursaries for employees to gain planning qualifications and more use of technical staff.</p>
	<p>The amounts payable are shown in the tables.</p>
	<p>Letters to all Leaders of local and county planning authorities; Chief Executives of the regional planning bodies; and the Mayor of London have been laid in the libries of the House. They set out the details of each recipient's grant.</p>
	<p>We will lay a Special Grant Report shortly.</p>

	<p>We are publishing today the new Armed Forces Overarching Personnel Strategy (AFOPS) main document.</p>
	<p>The AFOPS provides a clear sense of direction for Armed Forces personnel policies. It does so by providing a framework of five strategic themes and some 28 personnel strategic guidelines. These cover the full spectrum of the Service personnel policy agenda. The main document also highlights the challenges we will face in attracting and retaining our people for the future.</p>
	<p>AFOPS is intended to deliver real and tangible effect. The new main document looks at the achievements of the past two or so years relating to Service personnel, and further lays out the actions which will be taken forward in the most critical areas during the next two years.</p>
	<p>I have placed copies of the Document in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p>I announced on 17 October 2002 that I had commissioned an appraisal of the initial training of recruits across the Armed Services, and I undertook to publish findings. This appraisal was conducted by two senior officers from outside the personnel area and reported to Ministers. The leader of the study was given a wide ranging remit and freedom to pursue the study.</p>
	<p>Overall, the appraisal concluded that the Department can have considerable confidence in the initial training system. It is administered and staffed by professional men and women with a strong sense of duty and purpose, who have proved consistently successful in providing highly effective training for 23,000 recruits a year. Two areas were judged to need addressing. First, the Department as a responsible employer needs to continue to ensure that its young people are managed proficiently, treated fairly and given appropriate levels of professional and personal support. Second, the Department requires more rigorous assurance mechanisms, to provide regular monitoring, to expose risk and to promote best practice. The appraisal concluded that an assurance authority should be established outside the single-service chains of command. Some of these proposals will require extra investment.</p>
	<p>I am today placing in the Library of the House a copy of the appraisal, together with a departmental action plan responding to all of the recommendations and, where action is not already in hand or planned, assigning responsibility for examining the recommendation and taking it forward. The report is also available on the website: <a href="http://www.MOD.UK">www.MOD.UK</a>.</p>
