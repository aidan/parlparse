	<p pid="e.89WS.2/1">As part of the announcement of normalisation made by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" name="Peter Hain">the Member for Neath, (Mr. Hain)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August 2005</phrase>, the Government undertook to reduce the number of military bases in Northern Ireland to the 14 core sites named in the updated Security Annex to the Joint Declaration. We have since reported that only eight of those 14 core sites would be required in the future.</p>
	<p pid="e.89WS.2/2">However, a review of the requirement to retain a military hospital to provide secondary healthcare for service personnel in Northern Ireland has concluded that a commercial contract for Commissioned Care with an Independent Service Provider (ISP) for routine elective secondary healthcare represented the most effective and efficient means of providing quality secondary healthcare for regular military personnel. Therefore, I am announcing today our intention to close the Duke of Connaught Unit (DCU), the military hospital facility based at Musgrave Park Hospital, South Belfast, by <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.89WS.2/3">There will now be a period of consultation with the trade unions. We recognise the impact this decision will have on the civilian staff currently employed at the DCU, and we will make every effort to support them through this period of change.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-26e.90WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="90WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091126/wmstext/91126m0001.htm#09112624000432">
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/1">The meeting in Copenhagen next month is our chance to make a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and avoid dangerous climate change. But even if we secure a new global deal, some change is inescapable because of historic and projected emissions, and we need to take action to adapt to it or the consequences could be severe. The earlier we start adapting, the better equipped we will be to cope with the risks to our society, our environment and our economy. Homes and buildings, transport infrastructure and hospitals all need to be resilient to the impacts we face.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/2">The UK climate projections that I launched earlier this year showed many of the likely impacts of climate change for the UK which include warmer, wetter winters, hotter, drier summers, sea level rise and more severe weather including storms, floods heat waves and droughts. Climate change will affect almost every aspect of our lives and means that we will need some new infrastructure to cope. Action now will reduce costs for individuals, businesses and the public purse later.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/3">The Government are taking the lead. Government Departments will be producing adaptation plans by spring 2010, setting out how they are assessing and managing the risks from climate change across their programmes and estates. The Government are also identifying, assessing, and where possible calculating the cost of climate change risks and opportunities at UK, national and regional level through the UK climate change risk assessment which will be produced by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/4">In addition to this, the Climate Change Act 2008 gave the Government the power to require certain public bodies and statutory undertakers to assess and report on current risks from climate change and their plans for dealing with these risks.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/5">The Act requires me to lay before Parliament a report on how the Government propose to exercise this power within one year of Royal Assent (by <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-26">26 November 2009</phrase>), setting out the circumstances in which directions are likely to be given (the strategy for using the power) and the kinds of organisation which I consider should be directed as a matter of priority.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/6">Following public consultation on our proposals over the summer, and in accordance with the requirements of the Act, I am today laying this report before Parliament. It focuses on those organisations that are responsible for key public services; energy, water, transport and health. It also ensures that adapting to climate change is embedded into the work of organisations such as the NHS, local authorities, police and fire services by factoring climate change into relevant public sector regulation. Other organisations with functions to protect our natural environment, or which we consider to be of critical importance but do not fit the statutory criteria for direction are being invited to report.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/7">These organisations will have to report to me from summer until the end of 2011 outlining their assessment of the risks climate change poses and the steps they are going to take in response. This information will be used to inform the national adaptation programme which must be laid before Parliament in response to the risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/8">Copies of this report will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. A copy of the report is also on the DEFRA website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/adaptation">http://www.defra.gov.uk/adaptation</a>.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.2/9">The Government have also published their response to the consultation on the draft strategy for using the reporting power, and have today produced the statutory guidance to reporting organisations. Copies of these documents are also available.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-26e.91WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" speakeroffice="The Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism" colnum="91WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091126/wmstext/91126m0002.htm#09112624000433">
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/1">I have today placed in the Library our proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales for 2010-11. I intend to implement the proposals on police grant subject to consideration of any representations and the approval of the House. Copies are also available in the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/2">In summary, this settlement intends to make available &#163;259 million more than in 2009-10 in funding to the police service in 2010-11. Policing and reducing crime remain top priorities for this Government. We have continued to work hard to maintain the police grant at the best possible level as well as to provide secure and stable funding across policing, crime and drugs. We are committed to investing in the police so they have the tools and powers to fight crime and make communities safer.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/3">The Government previously announced provisional funding totals for the three-year period 2008-09 to 2010-11 in December 2007 and November 2008. This three-year settlement was received positively by police authorities and forces, as a means of providing greater certainty and improving medium-term planning. The Government face more challenging financial circumstances than expected at the time the three-year settlement was announced. The Home Secretary has however decided to prioritise funding for the police. I will therefore be implementing the substantial increases in police revenue funding set out in the three-year settlement in line with our statement in November 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/4">The funding settlement for 2010-11 continues to build on unprecedented levels of investment in the police service in England and Wales since 1997-98. On a like for like basis Government grant for the police will have increased by over 60 per cent. or over &#163;3.7 billion between 1997-98 and 2010-11. This is almost a 20 per cent. increase in real terms. This investment has helped to expand local policing significantly. There has been considerable achievement over the last 10 years investing in an improved mix of more officers and more police staff. The police workforce has increased by 30.9 per cent. (56,590) since 1997 to 239,607 in March 2009; a record number. This includes substantial growth in police staff (41.8 per cent.) that has freed police officers from back-office and support roles for the frontline.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/5">Neighbourhood policing forms the bedrock of local policing in the 21st century. Through effective engagement with their local community, other community safety service providers, representatives from the private sector and community organisations, neighbourhood policing teams ensure that local concerns are dealt with efficiently. Neighbourhood policing teams play a prominent part in delivering the commitments made in the Policing Pledge and in achieving the single top-down target of public confidence in police and councils to deal with crime and antisocial behaviour issues that matter locally, both of which require effective partnership working at the neighbourhood level. It is for individual police forces and authorities to ensure the effectiveness of neighbourhood policing in their area. The Government will hold forces to account for progress through the public confidence target, which has increased from 45 per cent. in March 2008 to 50 per cent. in July 2009. The Government are working with ACPO and APA colleagues to ensure forces deliver on the Policing Pledge, drawing on the recent inspection work by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC).</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/6">The police reform programme continues apace. The Policing White Paper, which will be published shortly, represents the next stage of the current police reform programme and an opportunity to highlight and review the progress that has been made in the 18 months since the publication of the Green Paper: &quot;From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing our Communities Together&quot;. Focusing on delivery of the Policing Pledge, the confidence target and protective services; and addressing our wider approach to tackling crime and antisocial behaviour in the context of the current financial climate, the Policing White Paper will give fresh impetus to the Government's vision for the future of accountable, professional and citizen focused policing, working effectively with partners nationally and locally.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/7">We continue to make good progress on reforming police and Criminal Justice Service processes to free up officer time by making greater use of technology and investment in mobile data devices. Jan Berry in her capacity as the independent Reducing Bureaucracy Advocate is challenging the police service, its partners and the Home Office to think about wider reductions in unnecessary bureaucracy. Her report includes recommendations for a range of Government agencies, a study on the custody process, and a review of the implementation of the recommendations made in the Flanagan review. The White Paper will respond to these.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/8">In 2009-10 some &#163;4.8 million was made available to the 16 tackling knives action programme police forces to enable them and their partners to undertake additional activity to tackle serious youth violence, including knife crime and gang-related violence, with a further &#163;500 thousand for supporting activities such as the Be Safe programme with schools. Figures published last month for England and Wales for the April to June 2009 period showed a fall in police recorded knife and sharp instrument related violence compared to 2008, including a provisional 35 per cent. drop in knife related homicides from 71 to 46, and a fall in firearms offences of 5 per cent. We want to build on the progress achieved so far and in the new year we will announce our plans for 2010-11 to enable the police and their partners to continue bringing about a step change in the levels of serious youth violence in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/9">The Home Office also contributes &#163;76 million to the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund and the Young Persons Substance Misuse Partnership Grant delivered by local government. In addition, there is a capital element of the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund that is under review. This funding will help local areas to deliver national and local improvement priorities such as those set out in local area agreements.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/10" class="italic">The police grant settlement 2010-11</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/11">Total provision for policing revenue grants in 2010-11 will be &#163;9,741 million, an overall increase of 2.7 per cent. The Government propose to distribute the settlement as set out below.</p>

	<p pid="e.91WS.2/27">Police funding proposals within the local government finance system for England are being announced by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1837" name="Barbara Follett">the Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett)</phrase> today, and those for Wales by the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/28">Provisional general policing grants (that is, Home Office Police Grant, Revenue Support Grant and National Non-domestic Rates) for English and Welsh police authorities in 2010-11 compared with 2009-10 are set out in table 2.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/29" class="italic">General grant</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/30">Within the general grant provision of a 2.7 per cent. increase, the funding floor was set at 2.5 per cent. increase for each of the CSR years. Each police authority in England and Wales is guaranteed an increase of at least this level. The grant floor provides for stability but at the same time a degree of grant scaling has enabled us to target resources to areas with greater relative need. Our promised review of the funding formula before the next CSR is already under way with active participation from the policing community.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/31">The Government have made it clear that there is no excuse for excessive increases in precepts on council tax next year. We will not hesitate to use capping powers to deal with excessive council tax increases in 2010-11, including requiring authorities to re-bill if necessary. We took capping action against two police authorities in 2009-10 and seven police authorities in 2008-09. This included, in 2008-09, the designation of Cheshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire police authorities for capping in advance of both 2009-10 and 2010-11. My right hon. Friend, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, who is the Minister responsible for local government, is announcing today that action is being taken forward to limit these authorities' precept increases to around 3 per cent. in 2010-11. The three authorities have 21 days in which to challenge our decision. Any challenges will be carefully considered before final decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/32" class="italic">Welsh police authorities</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/33">In line with previous years, I have again ensured that Welsh police authorities are treated on a par with English police authorities in respect to the floor damping mechanism. I have provided additional support of &#163;15.7 million in 2010-11 to ensure Dyfed-Powys, Gwent and North Wales police authorities receive at least a minimum grant increase of 2.5 per cent. equivalent to the level of the funding floor in England. Floor funding is also partly funded through the scaling of police grant to South Wales police authority, so as to maintain consistency with the treatment of English authorities and provide the level of grant it would receive if it were in England.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/34" class="italic">Specific grants for police authorities</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/35">Police authorities will continue to receive specific grants for particular schemes. Details are set out in table 3.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/36"><i>Counter</i><i>-t</i><i>errorism funding</i>-We will continue to invest in counter-terrorism policing. Funding for police counter-terrorism will be increased from &#163;552 million in 2009-10 to &#163;579 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/37">This announcement reinforces our CSR plans for continued growth in counter-terrorism policing.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/38"><i>Crime Fighting Fund</i><i>-</i>&#163;211 million will again be made available to forces in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/39"><i>Neighbourhood Policing</i><i>-</i>We will maintain the ring fence on this funding during 2010-11 to ensure that neighbourhood policing is properly embedded. Funding for each authority has increased by 2.7 per cent. A total of &#163;341 million will be made available in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/40" class="italic">Funding additional to the settlement</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/41"><i>Mobile Information Programme</i><i>-</i> In view of the enthusiastic response from frontline officers, and the success of the programme, a further &#163;30 million capital was made available in 2009-10 as part of our campaign to free up time for officers and reduce bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/42"><i>The Safer and Stronger Communities Fund</i><i>-</i>The resource element of &#163;61million and the Young Peoples Substance Misuse Grant of &#163;15 million will continue to be paid into the Area Based Grant for 2010-11. The Safer and Stronger Communities Fund Capital which is paid direct to local authorities by the Home Office is currently under review, and allocations will be announced at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/43">For the devolved Administration in Wales, where local area agreements are not applicable, the Crime Reduction and Anti-social Behaviour Grant is made available. The resource element of this grant will remain at &#163;3 million for 2010-11, but the capital element is currently under review, and allocations will be announced at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/44" class="italic">Capital</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/45">Police funding remains a priority for this Government. Even in very difficult financial times, we have prioritised the police. We have decided to continue to increase funding for the police by providing the &#163;259 million increase in revenue funding set out in the three year funding settlement. However, we have more difficult decisions to make on capital. We will therefore review and announce capital allocations in January 2010. The police will get the best possible settlement within our means.</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/46" class="italic">Efficiency</p>
	<p pid="e.91WS.2/47">The police share the public service duty to maximise value for money, especially in the current economic climate. Locally, it is the responsibility of police authorities to set ambitious targets for the efficiency and productivity gains to be achieved by their forces and to hold chief officers to account for delivery. It is also for authorities and forces to decide locally how to recycle the benefits of increased efficiency and productivity. Senior policing leaders must help drive the organisational change required to make significant improvements in value for money, both in their forces and authorities and working with others. Value for money must be central to the strategic vision for improving policing, and chief officers and senior leaders must be visibly associated with this organisational priority within the service.</p>

	<p pid="e.97WS.3/1">The Justice and Home Affairs Council is due to be held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-30">30 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase> in Brussels. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice,my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Lord Bach, and the Scottish Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, intend to attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands, the following items will be discussed:</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/2">The Council, beginning in Mixed Committee with non-EU Schengen states, will receive an update from the presidency on the current state of play on the implementation of the regulation establishing the Visa Information system (VIS). The UK does not participate in that regulation.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/3">The presidency will update Ministers on arrangements for the first milestone test for the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II). The UK welcomes the update and will seek to ensure that the test is well-planned and managed, ideally taking place before the end of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/4">The Council will have an orientation debate on the Commission's proposal for establishing an EU agency for the management of large-scale IT systems. The Commission carried out an impact assessment which endorsed the need to create an agency. The UK supports the need for an agency and wishes to take part in the adoption and application of this proposal.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/5">Finally, the Mixed Committee will be asked to adopt legislation giving Schengen visa liberalisation to Serbia, the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro. While the UK does not participate in the EU visa regime, we maintain an interest in all visa issues.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/6">Following Mixed Committee, the Council will be asked to adopt a decision authorising the presidency to sign, on behalf of the EU, an agreement between EU and Japan on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters (MLA). The presidency has recently concluded negotiations on this agreement and UK objectives in relation to this were met. The UK is therefore content for such a decision to be adopted, subject to the views of the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/7">The presidency will present the draft future JHA work programme (the Stockholm Programme) and there will be a general debate with interior items on day one and justice on day two. Ministers will be expected to agree the draft programme which will be adopted at the December European Council.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/8">Measures contained in the programme aim to ensure that every citizen can have confidence that, wherever they are in the EU, judicial decisions made in a civil court in their favour can be enforced, criminals will face justice and all defendants are guaranteed a fair trial.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/9">The programme will result in an EU where children are safer, where data is shared sensibly, where we facilitate legal travel but clamp down on illegal immigration, where mutual recognition is the cornerstone of judicial co-operation, where member states co-operate on counter-terrorism and combat organised crime, and where we work closely with external countries on JHA and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/10">There will be a state of play discussion on the Common European Asylum System, which is likely to focus on the recently published asylum procedures and qualification directives. Since December 2008 the European Commission has been proposing measures to deliver the second phase of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The proposals on the procedures (which sets out minimum standards for deciding asylum claims, including rules on such things as interviews and appeal rights) and qualification (which sets out the circumstances in which applicants will qualify for international protection) directives were published by the Commission on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-23">23 October 2009</phrase>. The presidency will want to gauge member states' initial reactions to the new proposals. The UK believes these directives are not necessary at this time as they undermine the migration pact and will be seeking to ensure that language in these directives aligns with the conclusions in the migration pact.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/11">Over lunch, Interior Ministers will hold a discussion on the location of the European asylum support office.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/12">The presidency will present the outcomes and action points of the EU-US ministerial troika and of the EU-Western Balkans ministerial forum. There will also be a presentation on the preparation of the EU-Russia ministerial Permanent Partnership Council (PPC), due to be held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-02">2 December</phrase> in Stockholm. The UK supports the presidency's efforts in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/13">There will be a presentation on the six-monthly report by the counter-terrorism co-ordinator (CTC). The CTC has recently revised the counter-terrorism action plan and after receiving comments from member states will present the action plan to the Council. The UK supports efforts made by the CTC to continue to drive forward EU co-operation on CT, and is particularly appreciative of his efforts with priority third countries, such as Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/14">The presidency is seeking to adopt the Council decision on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme. The US Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) currently uses payment information carried through the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) system to identify and trace terrorist finance and facilitators. This agreement is needed because of a restructuring of SWIFT. The UK supports the Council decision subject to the views of the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/15">The presidency is seeking to approve the proposal for an information management strategy for EU internal security. The strategy should allow enhanced project management and improved data security. The UK supports the latest draft which for a strategic approach across the areas of law enforcement, judicial co-operation and border management and is content for its approval at Council.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/16">On day two of the Council, as previously stated, Justice Ministers will be asked to discuss and agree to the justice aspects of the draft future JHA work programme (the Stockholm Programme).</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/17">The presidency will provide Justice Ministers with information on the current state of play of working group negotiations on the proposed framework decision on combating the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and child pornography. The Government support this measure, but due to the changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty, this proposal will no longer be taken forward as a framework decision. The Commission are likely to retable this proposal as a directive after the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect. The Government will update the Scrutiny Committees about this.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/18">Justice Ministers will also have an orientation debate about the negotiations that have been taking place at official level about a proposed framework decision on transfer of proceedings in criminal cases. This proposal, too, will no longer be taken forward as a framework decision after the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect. It would need to be represented as a directive, but it is unclear in what timescale this will happen.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/19">The Council will then have an orientation debate to clarify the way forward on the draft framework decision on combating trafficking of human beings following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The presidency will also seek to adopt the action orientated paper (AOP) on human trafficking. The UK welcomes the approach adopted in the AOP, which creates a more coherent and proactive approach to combating trafficking by EU member states in partnership with third countries.</p>
	<p pid="e.97WS.3/20">Finally on the justice agenda, the presidency are expected to inform the Council on the state of play on e-justice.</p>

	<p pid="e.101WS.5/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-30">30 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase> in Brussels. I shall represent the United Kingdom on all items on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-30">30 November</phrase>, except for the intervention on &quot;gender equality: strengthening growth and employment&quot;, where the United Kingdom will be represented by my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House of Commons, Lord Privy Seal and Minister for Women and Equality. Health business will be taken on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.5/2">The first and main item of the agenda will be a policy debate on recovering from the financial crisis and preparing for the post-2010 Lisbon strategy. The presidency wants a contribution to the debate on a successor to the strategy after 2010, in the context of demographic change and economic recovery. There will also be a policy debate on gender equality, strengthening growth and employment. The United Kingdom wants to ensure that the post-2010 Lisbon strategy reflects the realities of the changing requirements of the European labour market by focusing on the need for fairness.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.5/3">The presidency will seek political agreement on a revised parental leave directive. Social partners signed a new framework agreement in June 2009 and the European Commission published a proposal for a directive to implement the new agreement. The United Kingdom welcomes that agreement. The presidency will also seek political agreement on work in fishing convention which applies to all fishers and all fishing vessels engaged in commercial fishing operations. The United Kingdom supported the development and adoption of the convention, and is committed to working towards ratification. The other item for political agreement is a directive on equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self-employed capacity. This aims to promote equal treatment between self-employed workers and their &quot;assisting spouses&quot;. The United Kingdom welcomes the progress the Swedish presidency has made with the text and is working with the presidency to achieve a reasonable outcome at Council.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.5/4">The presidency will seek adoption of Council conclusions on healthy and dignified ageing. The United Kingdom supports the text which acknowledges the importance of active ageing in light of the demographic challenge. The Council will also seek adoption of Council conclusions on follow-up of the implementation by the member states and the European Union institutions of the Beijing platform of action to strengthen institutional mechanisms for promoting gender equality. The United Kingdom fully supports this and has submitted a report on progress in implementing the platform.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.5/5">There will be a progress report on the anti-discrimination directive. The United Kingdom has taken a positive approach to the directive but emphasises the need for the directive to be clear and that any action has to be proportionate to the issue being tackled.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.5/6">Under any other business, there will be information on conferences held under the Swedish presidency. The incoming Spanish presidency will also give an outline of their work programme.</p>
