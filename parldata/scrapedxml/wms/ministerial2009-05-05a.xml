<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-05-05a.4WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe" colnum="4WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/wmstext/90505m0001.htm#0905053000129">
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/2">The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/3">General Affairs</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/4">Full details of A points adopted at the General Affairs Council can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/5"><a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsdata/docs/pressdata/en/gena/107418.pdf">http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/107418.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/6" class="italic">Croatia<i>-</i>Enlargement</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/7">The Council took stock of the progress of accession negotiations with Croatia, focusing on the bilateral territorial dispute between Croatia and Slovenia, with the latter blocking the nine chapters ready for opening or closing. Commissioner Rehn briefed on his efforts to find a solution and set out a compromise proposal, which received widespread support.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/8">The presidency called on both sides in the border dispute to show political will and a constructive approach in finding a compromise. They stressed the urgency of the issue and hoped that both sides would be able to respond to the Commission's latest proposal by early May. The Government endorse the presidency's approach and support the efforts of Commissioner Rehn to facilitate a mutually acceptable solution to the territorial dispute so that accession negotiations can move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/9" class="italic">Employment and Energy Summits</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/10">The presidency briefed on the preparations for the <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-07">7 May</phrase> Employment summit and the Southern Corridor summit on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-08">8 May</phrase>. The aim of the former summit, which the Government support, is to equip the EU's labour markets for future economic recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/11">The Southern Corridor summit will follow up the spring European Council's call for diversification of sources and routes of energy supplies demonstrating the EU's strong political support for the development of the Southern Corridor through concrete actions. It will give a strong message that the EU and Southern Corridor partner countries are prepared to enhance their relations, particularly in the energy and transport fields. The Government strongly welcome the summit and the draft joint declaration.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/12">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/13">The full text of Council conclusions (including A points) can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsdata/docs/pressdata/en/gena/107419.pdf">http://www.consilium. europa.eu/uedocs/cmsdata/docs/pressdata/en/gena/107419.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/14" class="italic">Eastern Partnership Summit</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/15">The presidency requested high-level representation at the summit, arguing that recent political difficulties in Moldova, Ukraine and elsewhere showed that these countries needed greater EU attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/16" class="italic">European Neighbourhood Policy</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/17">Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner presented the <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-23">23 April</phrase> Commission Communication on the implementation of ENP in 2008, and the accompanying set of ENP country progress reports. There was no discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/18" class="italic">Burma</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/19">The presidency announced the adoption of the EU's common position renewing restrictive measures for a further 12 months, which the Government strongly support.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/20">EU Foreign Ministers also adopted conclusions, which the Government also welcome, expressing concern about the human rights situation; underlining the EU's commitment to promoting political, social and economic reform in Burma-Myanmar; and urging the Government of Burma-Myanmar to engage meaningfully with the UN Secretary General's good offices mission.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/21" class="italic">Sri Lanka</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/22">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary thanked Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for her positive and active engagement. He announced that he would visit Sri Lanka on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-29">29 April</phrase> to call for urgent action by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to avoid further civilian casualties and avert a humanitarian disaster; inside the conflict zone, civilians remained trapped by the fighting; the reported intimidation and killings by the LTTE were completely unacceptable; outside, internally displaced persons desperately needed full access to humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/23">The Council adopted conclusions, based on a UK text, which: noted the LTTE's announcement of a unilateral cease-fire; called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to allow safe evacuation of civilians trapped in the conflict zone; welcomed the reported announcement by GoSL of an end to heavy military operations; welcomed the visit of Sir John Holmes, UN Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs; and repeated calls on GoSL to proceed urgently towards an inclusive and peaceful political process.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/24" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/25">Discussion focussed on the EU's key messages to the parties. Ministers agreed on the importance of supporting a two-state solution and the integration of the Arab peace initiative, encouraging adherence to road map commitments, in particular on settlements, and urging Israel to open the crossings into Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/26">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary stressed the importance of pursuing our existing policy with more vigour and clarity; our focus should be on action not words.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/27">The presidency concluded that there was a consensus behind the EU's overriding message of support for a two-state solution. There were no conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/28" class="italic">Migration in the Mediterranean</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/29">This item was added to the agenda at the request of Malta and Italy, following a dispute between the two member states concerning the fate of 140 migrants rescued in nearby waters on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-16">16 April</phrase>. They expressed concerns about the issue of illegal migration across the Mediterranean, pointing out that it was a problem for the EU as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/30">The UK is equally concerned about the increasing flows of illegal migrants through the Mediterranean region, many of whom transit through Libya before reaching Europe. In the last 12 months there have been approximately 34,000 illegal migrants entering Europe by sea on this route. We are working closely with our European partners, in particular Italy and Malta, to develop an effective framework for co-operation on border control with Libya.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/31" class="italic">Somalia-Piracy</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/32">This was added at Belgium's request following an attack upon a Belgian-flagged merchant vessel by pirates off the Somali coast on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-18">18 April</phrase>. Ministers discussed the recent surge in pirate activity off the coast of Somalia, and welcomed the positive action being taken by the EU counter-piracy operation ATALANTA in response.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/33" class="italic">EU<i>-</i><i>US </i><i>s</i>ummit follow-up</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/34">Ministers discussed the main issues arising from the recent EU-US summit, in particular Iran and Afghanistan-Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/35">High Representative Solana updated on his contacts with the Iranians following the E3+3's invitation to meet them. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary underlined the need for the EU to adopt a robust approach in support of the US Administration's decision to engage with Iran. Solana agreed that the EU should be ready to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/36">Ministers also adopted conclusions on Iran, which the Government welcome, supporting the new direction of US policy; and calling upon Iran to engage seriously with the international community in order to find a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue which will address its national interests, while noting that the evolution of the EU's relations with Iran will also depend on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/37">On Afghanistan-Pakistan, High Representative Solana said there was a need for the EU to be more creative on Pakistan. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary underlined the importance of a successful EU-Pakistan Summit in June. The Commission noted its contribution of &euro;40 million (&pound;36 million) to the Afghanistan elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/38" class="italic">Ukraine</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/39">The presidency introduced a discussion of the unstable political situation. There were no conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/40" class="italic">Moldova</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/41">High Representative Solana reported on his visit to Chisinau in the previous week. He said it was important the EU kept engaging with Moldova, through the Eastern Partnership and by negotiating a &quot;New Agreement&quot;. Ministers welcomed the efforts of the High Representative, presidency and EU Special Representative in bringing about agreement that the Moldovan Government would enter into a political dialogue with the Opposition, and conduct an inquiry into the human rights abuses that followed the post-election protests. There were no conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/42">AOB</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/43" class="italic">Durban Review Conference</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/44">Some member states expressed concerns about the lack of a co-ordinated EU approach to the Durban review conference. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary encouraged EU engagement in similar for a along with the Africans and others who had supported some of our positions in the negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/45" class="italic">Human Rights and Public Diplomacy</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/46">The Swedish Foreign Minister put forward proposals for publicising the EU's work on human rights. The presidency agreed to refer the issue to officials for further work.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/47" class="italic">Swine Influenza</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/48">The Commission debriefed Ministers on actions taken in response to the outbreak of swine influenza in Mexico. An extraordinary meeting of Health Ministers would be held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-30">30 April</phrase> in Luxembourg.</p>
