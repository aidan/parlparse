	<p pid="a.1WS.4/3">The European Commission forecasts to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-04">4 May</phrase> will form the basis of an exchange of views between Ministers about the economic situation.

The Government strongly support the principle of increased financial assistance from the EU for member states facing balance of payments difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/6" class="italic">Quality and sustainability of public finances</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/7">ECOFIN will be asked to adopt conclusions on the implementation of structural reforms to enhance the sustainability and quality of public finances, and endorse a report on age-related economic and budgetary projections for EU member states.

	<p pid="a.1WS.4/10" class="italic">Dialogue with third countries</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/11">The Commission will update the Council on recent progress made on regulatory dialogues with third countries, in particular the United States, China, Japan and Russia.

	<p pid="a.2WS.2/1">The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to set and meet a timetable for the majority of planning cases which are to be decided by her (as opposed to being decided by a planning inspector) and to make a report to Parliament each year on performance. This is intended both to ensure that such cases are dealt with expeditiously and to enable the parties to any particular case to know when they can expect to receive a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.2/2">The Secretary of State has accordingly today laid before Parliament an Act Paper reporting on performance on all decisions made between <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase> to which statutory timetables apply. Such timetables apply to decisions on called-in planning applications; planning appeals recovered for the Secretary of State's decision; other cases &quot;linked&quot; to such decisions (including listed building consent and conservation area consent); and appeals against refusals of consent for works to trees covered by tree preservation orders. They do not apply to cases decided by inspectors (which includes all tree preservation order appeals lodged on or after <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>) or to cases decided by the Secretary of State jointly with a Minister of another Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.2/3">During the period from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, 73 (95 per cent.) of the 77 cases decided by the Secretary of State other than tree preservation order appeals were made within their statutory timetables, as were 415 out of 416 decisions (99.75 per cent.) of tree preservation order appeals.</p>

	<p pid="a.3WS.1/1">I am today publishing a consultation on proposals for a new Planning Policy Statement 4: &quot;Planning for Prosperous Economies&quot; (PPS4). Copies of the consultation are being placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/2">The planning system is a key lever the Government have to contribute towards improving economic performance. The current uncertain economic times have highlighted the need for planning policies at the national, regional and local level to be flexible and responsive so that they support the economic aspirations of our communities, whether in cities, market towns or rural villages.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/3">In light of this and in keeping with our commitment in our 2007 Planning White Paper and the recommendations of the Killian Pretty review, this comprehensive new draft statement brings together in one place all of the Government's key planning policies relating to the economy and streamlines and simplifies policy to focus on what is important to allow the economy to grow in a sustainable manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/4">The new PPS will, in its final form, replace Planning Policy Guidance Note 4: &quot;Industrial, commercial development and small firms&quot; (PPG4, 1992), Planning Policy Guidance Note 5: &quot;Simplified Planning Zones&quot; (PPG5, 1992), Planning Policy Statement 6: &quot;Planning for town centres&quot; (PPS6, 2005), Planning Policy Statement 7: &quot;Sustainable development in rural areas&quot; (PPS7) (in so far as it relates to economic development) and paragraphs 53, 54 and Annex D of Planning Policy Guidance Note 13: &quot;Transport&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/5">At the heart of our policy is the requirement that development plans need to have clear, proactive, proportionate and flexible policies aimed at supporting the start up and growth of businesses, attracting inward investment and increasing employment, particularly in deprived areas. It emphasises that we need also to protect existing investment in our cities and towns by safeguarding the town centres which are the bedrock of our economic future. Our urban centres are not only the engine of the country's economy&mdash;and through their urban renaissance policy this Government have strengthened the future of many such centres after years of decline&mdash;but are also the hub of community life, helping to stitch together communities through cultural, leisure, social and educational facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/6">The policy statement continues to put town centres first by ensuring that development continues to take place in town centres and promotes their vitality, viability and character. As previously consulted on in draft PPS6, we have removed the &quot;need test&quot; for proposals outside town centres but retained the &quot;sequential test&quot; which requires developers to justify why they cannot build in the centre before they seek to build out of town and strengthened the &quot;impact test&quot; to focus on the potential economic, social and environmental effects of development.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/7">The revised policy also implements a number of recommendations arising from the review by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St.Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> of rural housing and economic development. The Government agree with his key finding that we need a more subtle appreciation of what makes rural communities sustainable, and that rural communities, as much as urban areas, need to plan for change in the face of new economic, environmental and demographic pressures. In bringing together our policies on economic development in town and country into one policy statement we are emphasising in the rural context what is taken for granted in urban contexts: that economic sustainability is a prerequisite for social and environmental sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/8">Similarly, we are responding to the thrust of the recommendations made in the advice provided to the Prime Minister by Stuart Burgess, the Rural Advocate. We see both the Rural Advocate's report and the Taylor review as important elements of a growing consensus which recognises the economic opportunities offered by rural areas and the contribution they make to the economy at large.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/9">The draft statement does not include any specific proposals for a 'competition test' that was recommended by the Competition Commission. In June 2008, Tesco PLC challenged the Commission's recommendation in the Competition Appeal Tribunal. In March 2009, the application by Tesco was allowed and the recommendation quashed. The Tribunal unanimously concluded that the Commission, in its report, had failed properly to consider certain matters which were relevant to its recommendation that the competition test be imposed as part of a package of remedies to address the adverse effect on competition identified by the Commission. The Government will await the Competition Commission's reconsideration of the issue before deciding how to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/10">The proposed changes I am setting out today will play a part in facilitating sustainable economic growth in urban and rural areas and ensuring our town centres thrive for years to come. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-28">28 July 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.4WS.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/2">The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/3">General Affairs</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/4">Full details of A points adopted at the General Affairs Council can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/5"><a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsdata/docs/pressdata/en/gena/107418.pdf">http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/107418.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/6" class="italic">Croatia<i>-</i>Enlargement</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/7">The Council took stock of the progress of accession negotiations with Croatia, focusing on the bilateral territorial dispute between Croatia and Slovenia, with the latter blocking the nine chapters ready for opening or closing. Commissioner Rehn briefed on his efforts to find a solution and set out a compromise proposal, which received widespread support.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/8">The presidency called on both sides in the border dispute to show political will and a constructive approach in finding a compromise. They stressed the urgency of the issue and hoped that both sides would be able to respond to the Commission's latest proposal by early May. The Government endorse the presidency's approach and support the efforts of Commissioner Rehn to facilitate a mutually acceptable solution to the territorial dispute so that accession negotiations can move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/9" class="italic">Employment and Energy Summits</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/10">The presidency briefed on the preparations for the <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-07">7 May</phrase> Employment summit and the Southern Corridor summit on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-08">8 May</phrase>. The aim of the former summit, which the Government support, is to equip the EU's labour markets for future economic recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/11">The Southern Corridor summit will follow up the spring European Council's call for diversification of sources and routes of energy supplies demonstrating the EU's strong political support for the development of the Southern Corridor through concrete actions. It will give a strong message that the EU and Southern Corridor partner countries are prepared to enhance their relations, particularly in the energy and transport fields. The Government strongly welcome the summit and the draft joint declaration.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/12">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/13">The full text of Council conclusions (including A points) can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsdata/docs/pressdata/en/gena/107419.pdf">http://www.consilium. europa.eu/uedocs/cmsdata/docs/pressdata/en/gena/107419.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/14" class="italic">Eastern Partnership Summit</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/15">The presidency requested high-level representation at the summit, arguing that recent political difficulties in Moldova, Ukraine and elsewhere showed that these countries needed greater EU attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/16" class="italic">European Neighbourhood Policy</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/17">Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner presented the <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-23">23 April</phrase> Commission Communication on the implementation of ENP in 2008, and the accompanying set of ENP country progress reports. There was no discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/18" class="italic">Burma</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/19">The presidency announced the adoption of the EU's common position renewing restrictive measures for a further 12 months, which the Government strongly support.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/20">EU Foreign Ministers also adopted conclusions, which the Government also welcome, expressing concern about the human rights situation; underlining the EU's commitment to promoting political, social and economic reform in Burma-Myanmar; and urging the Government of Burma-Myanmar to engage meaningfully with the UN Secretary General's good offices mission.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/21" class="italic">Sri Lanka</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/22">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary thanked Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for her positive and active engagement. He announced that he would visit Sri Lanka on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-29">29 April</phrase> to call for urgent action by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to avoid further civilian casualties and avert a humanitarian disaster; inside the conflict zone, civilians remained trapped by the fighting; the reported intimidation and killings by the LTTE were completely unacceptable; outside, internally displaced persons desperately needed full access to humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/23">The Council adopted conclusions, based on a UK text, which: noted the LTTE's announcement of a unilateral cease-fire; called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to allow safe evacuation of civilians trapped in the conflict zone; welcomed the reported announcement by GoSL of an end to heavy military operations; welcomed the visit of Sir John Holmes, UN Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs; and repeated calls on GoSL to proceed urgently towards an inclusive and peaceful political process.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/24" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/25">Discussion focussed on the EU's key messages to the parties. Ministers agreed on the importance of supporting a two-state solution and the integration of the Arab peace initiative, encouraging adherence to road map commitments, in particular on settlements, and urging Israel to open the crossings into Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/26">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary stressed the importance of pursuing our existing policy with more vigour and clarity; our focus should be on action not words.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/27">The presidency concluded that there was a consensus behind the EU's overriding message of support for a two-state solution. There were no conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/28" class="italic">Migration in the Mediterranean</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/29">This item was added to the agenda at the request of Malta and Italy, following a dispute between the two member states concerning the fate of 140 migrants rescued in nearby waters on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-16">16 April</phrase>. They expressed concerns about the issue of illegal migration across the Mediterranean, pointing out that it was a problem for the EU as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/30">The UK is equally concerned about the increasing flows of illegal migrants through the Mediterranean region, many of whom transit through Libya before reaching Europe. In the last 12 months there have been approximately 34,000 illegal migrants entering Europe by sea on this route. We are working closely with our European partners, in particular Italy and Malta, to develop an effective framework for co-operation on border control with Libya.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/31" class="italic">Somalia-Piracy</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/32">This was added at Belgium's request following an attack upon a Belgian-flagged merchant vessel by pirates off the Somali coast on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-18">18 April</phrase>. Ministers discussed the recent surge in pirate activity off the coast of Somalia, and welcomed the positive action being taken by the EU counter-piracy operation ATALANTA in response.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/33" class="italic">EU<i>-</i><i>US </i><i>s</i>ummit follow-up</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/34">Ministers discussed the main issues arising from the recent EU-US summit, in particular Iran and Afghanistan-Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/35">High Representative Solana updated on his contacts with the Iranians following the E3+3's invitation to meet them. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary underlined the need for the EU to adopt a robust approach in support of the US Administration's decision to engage with Iran. Solana agreed that the EU should be ready to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/36">Ministers also adopted conclusions on Iran, which the Government welcome, supporting the new direction of US policy; and calling upon Iran to engage seriously with the international community in order to find a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue which will address its national interests, while noting that the evolution of the EU's relations with Iran will also depend on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/37">On Afghanistan-Pakistan, High Representative Solana said there was a need for the EU to be more creative on Pakistan. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary underlined the importance of a successful EU-Pakistan Summit in June.

	<p pid="a.7WS.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I wish to make the following statement to the House about the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas. Our sincere condolences go to the families of the 13 service personnel who have lost their lives in service of their country since the last statement, and our thoughts and prayers remain with all the families whose loved ones have died on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/2">Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-02">2 February 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2009-02-02.37"><i>Official Report</i>, column 37WS</phrase>, with information about the conduct of inquests by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This statement gives the position at <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">27 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/3">The tables which accompany this statement again include information about those cases which involve a board of inquiry or a service inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/4">Progress with inquests</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/5">At the time of the last statement, we reported that 220 inquests had been held since June 2006: 206 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/6">Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-27">27 January</phrase> a further 10 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This makes a total of 230 inquests held since June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/7">Since operations commenced in 2001 there have been a total of 254 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including four service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/8">We remain very grateful for the efforts of all the coroners involved in conducting these inquests and unswerving in our support of the independent coronial system.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/9">Our Departments continue to work closely together, and with the coroners, to review the way in which the system is working and to look for opportunities, prior to the implementation of the coroners' legislation which is currently before Parliament in the Coroners and Justice Bill, to make improvements for the benefit of the bereaved families.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-17">17 March</phrase> the Government tabled amendments to the Coroners and Justice Bill, which will have the effect of enabling fatal accident inquiries to take place in Scotland into the deaths of service personnel killed on operations overseas. This reflects our commitment to support bereaved service families and will mean that families in Scotland will no longer, in most cases, have to travel to England for inquests.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/11">Open inquests</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/12" class="italic">i<i>.</i> Pre-<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> Fatalities</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/13">The statement in February reported that there was one remaining inquest to be held into a death where the body was repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>&mdash;that into the death of Marine Wigley. That remains the position and the inquest will be heard for five days starting on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-11">11 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/14" class="italic">ii<i>.</i> Post-<phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> Fatalities</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/15">Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests will not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon jurisdiction (since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> fatalities are repatriated via RAF Lyneham). The coroner transfers inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible. David Masters retired as the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March</phrase> but his successor, David Ridley, has appointed him as an assistant deputy coroner to ensure that his experience and expertise is retained.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/16">There are 71 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> (33 involving deaths in the last six months). Of these, Mr Ridley has retained 38 inquests, while 33 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next-of-kin. Inquest hearing dates have been set in 11 of these cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/17" class="italic">iii. Inquests into the deaths of service personnel who returned home injured</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/18">There remain three inquests to be held of service personnel who returned home injured and subsequently died of their injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/19">We shall continue to keep the House informed about progress with the remaining inquests. I have placed tables in the Library of the House which outline the status of all cases and date of death of each case. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.9WS.2/1">We are today beginning a UK consultation on the European Commission proposal for an equal treatment directive. The consultation will end on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-28">28 July 2009</phrase>. The consultation document seeks views to inform the UK Government's further consideration of a proposed European Commission (EC) directive to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation outside the areas of employment and vocational training.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/2">The UK Government wish to consult in particular on the impact of the draft directive in those areas where their proposals are, or might be, at variance with the current and proposed law, and on the impact of the proposals on individuals, business and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/3">The written consultation is being supplemented by a range of discussions with key stakeholders bilaterally and members of the public through public consultation events.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/4">The consultation document is being sent to around 300 organisations and will be available on the website of the Government Equalities Office at: <a href="http://www.equalities.gov.uk/international/eu_directive.asp">www.equalities. gov.uk/international/eu_directive.asp</a>x</p>
