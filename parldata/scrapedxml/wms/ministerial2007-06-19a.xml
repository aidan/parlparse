	<p pid="a.80WS.4/1">Following the annual review, on <phrase class="date" code="">26 June</phrase> the Secretary of State will lay regulations to update the home loss payment thresholds in section 30 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (as amended). Home loss payments are paid at a rate of 10 per cent. of the market value to owner-occupiers who are displaced from their homes as a result of compulsory purchase or certain housing orders. These are subject to maximum and minimum payments. Tenants receive a flat rate equal to the minimum payment to owner-occupiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.4/2">With effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2007</phrase> the maximum payment to owner-occupiers displaced from their home will be increased from &pound;40,000 to &pound;44,000 and the minimum payment will be increased from &pound;4,000 to &pound;4,400. The flat-rate will be increased from &pound;4,000 to &pound;4,400.</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.4/3">The period of two months between laying the regulations and commencement will give acquiring authorities reasonable notice to revise their budgets for compensation. This is similar to the notice period given in previous years for revisions to the home loss payments thresholds.</p>

	<p pid="a.81WS.1/1">I am today publishing two consultation documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/2">The document &quot;Delivering Housing and Regeneration: Communities England and the Future of Social Housing Regulation&quot; outlines proposals to create a new housing and regeneration agency, Communities England, and also responds to Professor Cave's review of social housing regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/3">At the end of last year I asked Professor Martin Cave, Director of the Centre for Management under Regulation at Warwick Business School to carry out a review of social housing regulation, the first for 30 years. Professor Cave's report, &quot;Every Tenant Matters&quot;, is published today. The Government's initial response to Professor Cave's report is also published today, and forms part of &quot;Delivering Housing and Regeneration: Communities England and the Future of Social Housing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/4">The consultation document outlines:</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/5" class="indent">The delivery functions that are proposed to transfer to Communities England from central Government, and also the proposed roles that central Government will retain.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/6" class="indent">The portfolio of investment tools that are proposed for Communities England;</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/7" class="indent">The new agency's place making role; explaining how Communities England will tailor its interventions to the needs of communities and seeking views on how it should work with local partners, including the private sector, to create vibrant and economically sustainable places;</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/8" class="indent">Proposals for the future regulation of social housing in response to Professor Cave; ensuring that the system better protects and empowers tenants, works better with central and local government and reduces unnecessary burdens.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/9" class="indent">The proposed accountability of the new organisation to Ministers and local communities, and how it will report its outcomes;</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/10" class="indent">Work that is already being undertaken to prepare the way for the establishment of Communities England; and</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/11" class="indent">Next steps required to make Communities England a reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/12">I am also today publishing a consultation paper, &quot;Tenant Empowerment&quot;, outlining proposals to increase empowerment of social housing tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/13">It includes the following for delivering a strengthened role for tenant voice:</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/14" class="indent">A draft Statutory Instrument to simplify the Housing (Right to Manage) Regulations 1994 for local authority tenants to make it easier for those who wish to trigger the process of developing tenant management with their local authority. This follows a commitment in the local government White Paper: &quot;Strong and Prosperous Communities&quot; to review these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/15" class="indent">A proposal to promote a voluntary tenant management process for all social housing tenants and landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/16" class="indent">Opportunity to comment on how tenant management organisations may extend their role to wider neighbourhood services.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/17" class="indent">A proposal to form a national tenant organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/18" class="indent">Consultation on options for tenant led/tenant owned ALMOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.1/19">Both documents are available in the Libraries of both Houses can be accessed via the Communities and Local Government website:</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-06-19a.82WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="82WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070619/wmstext/70619m0001.htm#07061942000272">
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-27">27 March</phrase> my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government announced that 16 proposals for unitary local government were proceeding to stakeholder consultation, <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-27">27 March 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-03-27.71WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 71WS</phrase>. That consultation runs until <phrase class="date" code="">22 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/2">Eight of those proposals relate to local authorities which lie within, or partly within, a national park, and may thus have implications for the appointments which local authorities make to national park authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/3">At present, local authority appointees make up a majority of the members on each national park authority but those appointments are shared between a number of different local authorities. In the event that all or most of those local authorities were replaced by a single unitary, there would be a significant concentration of appointments&mdash;under some permutations a single unitary authority would be able to appoint 12 out of the 22 members on a national park authority (at present no single local authority appoints more than six members).</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/4">The Government think that such a concentration of appointments is undesirable. National park authorities have been independent bodies since 1997 and I believe their independent status has helped them to deliver the national park purposes and to meet both local and national needs. That independence might be threatened&mdash;or might seem to be threatened&mdash;if a single local authority appointed too high a proportion of their members.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/5">Practically I am also conscious that a new unitary local authority, given its total number of members and the many responsibilities upon it, may have difficulty in finding sufficient members who were able to devote the necessary time to serving on a national park authority .</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/6">For those reasons I have decided that where unitary local government might lead to a single local authority appointing eight or more members on to a national park authority, I shall want to take action in advance to ensure the independence of that authority. If such circumstances arise, I intend to review the membership of each affected national park authority with a view to reducing the number of its local authority appointees.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/7">Where I conclude that it is indeed appropriate to reduce the number of principal local authority seats on any national park authority, I shall also want to reflect on whether that should be allowed to feed through into a smaller overall size of authority or whether the number of 'other' seats&mdash;for example, those appointed by DEFRA&mdash;should be expanded so as to maintain the same overall size.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/8">If I do conclude that it would be appropriate to add some extra seats within the 'other' category&mdash;for example, those appointed by DEFRA&mdash;I would envisage using those new seats to recruit particular qualities that are either under-represented at present or might become so following a reduction in local authority members.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/9">By this mechanism one might aim to ensure, for example, that there was always a minimum number of members with strong local links, or with knowledge of youth issues, or with knowledge of the regional layer of government.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/10">The potential changes I have described could all be achieved through secondary legislation, following the amendments to the 1995 Environment Act which were introduced by section 61 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.4/11">If, having reviewed the membership of individual national park authorities, I do in fact conclude that changes in membership are desirable, I shall of course undertake a full public consultation on my precise proposals before laying the necessary statutory instrument before Parliament : I am in any case required by the Environment Act 1995 (schedule 7 paragraph 2 (3)) to consult the local authority (ies) with land in a national park before making any changes to the local authority membership of that national park authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.83WS.2/1">I have today placed in the library a copy of the report by Mrs. Linda Costelloe Baker, the Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance Refusals with Limited Rights of Appeal, covering the period <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>. A copy is also available on the UKvisas website at: <a href="http://www.ukvisas.co.uk">www.ukvisas.co.uk</a> together with UKvisas' response to the monitor's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/2">I welcome Mrs. Costelloe Baker's constructive and positive report, which is based on her detailed review of 1,117 cases out of the 2.1 million handled by UKvisas during the period <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September 2006</phrase>. Mrs. Costelloe Baker notes a significant improvement in the quality of UKvisas' work as it began to focus more firmly on balance and customer service.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/3">Mrs. Costelloe Baker is satisfied that 90 per cent. of refusal decisions in her sample were reasonable. This is a rise of 3.7 per cent. over the 2005 sample. The report contains a number of practical recommendations to UKvisas in regard to the quality of its decision making, customer service and complaint handling. UKvisas intends to make use of these recommendations to make further improvements to its business performance and customer service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/4">I wish to express my thanks to Mrs. Costelloe Baker for her hard work in completing this, her second report as Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance Refusals with Limited Rights of Appeal. Her next report will cover the period from October 2006 to March 2007 and will be published in autumn 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.86WS.1/1">I am pleased to announce that the fifth annual report of the appointed person under the Proceeds of CrimeAct 2002 has been laid before Parliament today. The appointed person is an independent person who scrutinises the use of the search power introduced to support the measures in the Act to seize and forfeit criminal cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/2">The report gives the appointed person's opinion as to the circumstances and manner in which the search powers conferred by the Act are being exercised. I am pleased that the appointed person, Andrew Clarke, has expressed satisfaction with the operation of the search power and has found that there is nothing to suggest that the procedures are not being followed in accordance with the Act.</p>

These sums are subject to forfeiture in the magistrates court. These powers are a valuable tool in the fight against crime and the report shows that the way they are used has been, and will continue to be, closely monitored.</p>
