	&quot;Safer Children in a Digital World&quot; (Byron Review)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-03-27b.13WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families" colnum="13WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080327/wmstext/80327m0001.htm#08032765000171">
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/1">The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and I today welcome the publication of the report of the Byron review of the risks to children of potentially harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games. A copy of the report, &quot;Safer Children in a Digital World&quot;, will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/2">In September 2007 the Prime Minister asked Dr. Tanya Byron to lead an independent review to help parents and their children get the best from new technologies while protecting children from inappropriate or harmful material. This review has been jointly sponsored by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/3">The objectives of the Byron review were: to undertake a review of the evidence on risks to children's safety and wellbeing of exposure to potentially harmful or inappropriate material on the internet and in video games; and to assess the effectiveness and adequacy of existing measures to help prevent children from being exposed to such material and help parents understand and manage the risks of access to inappropriate material, and to make recommendations for improvements or additional action.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/4">Dr. Byron's final report published today sets out a detailed analysis of the evidence on the risks and benefits of new technologies and evaluates the work already being done to protect children online and ensure appropriate access to age-rated video games. In doing so, Dr. Byron recognises the need to develop a shared culture of responsibility with families, industry and Government all playing their part to reduce the availability of potentially harmful material, restrict access to it by children and to increase children's resilience and ability to understand and manage risk. We welcome and support this approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/5">To achieve this, Dr. Byron recommends reforming how Government and stakeholders work to improve our children's safety when using the internet through the following measures:</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/6">The creation of a new UK Council for Child Internet Safety, established by and reporting to the Prime Minister, including representation from across Government, industry, children's charities and other key stakeholders. The Council is to be chaired jointly by the Home Office and DCSF. DCMS will play a key role given its important policy responsibilities and expertise in this area of media and content regulation. A range of other Departments will also be closely involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/7">The development by the Council of a three-pronged national strategy for improving child internet safety:</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/8" class="indent">Challenging industry to take greater responsibility in supporting families through: clearer advice; establishing independently monitored codes of practice on areas such as user generated content; improving access to high quality parental control software and safe search; and better regulation of online promotions.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/9" class="indent">Developing a comprehensive public information and awareness campaign on child internet safety, including an authoritative &quot;one stop shop&quot; on child internet safety. This is to be led by Government but using the support and expertise of all Council members.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/10" class="indent">Putting in place sustainable education and children's service initiatives to improve the skills of children and their parents around e-safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/11">On video games, Dr. Byron recommends a range of high profile and targeted efforts to help inform parents and children of the appropriateness of different video games and to restrict inappropriate access such as:</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/12" class="indent">Lowering the statutory requirement to classify video games to 12+, that is consistent with film classification and easier for parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/13" class="indent">Putting in place a hybrid classification system, using both PEGI and BBFC mechanisms with one set of symbols, from BBFC, for parents to understand.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/14" class="indent">Having clear and consistent guidance for industry on how games should be advertised.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/15" class="indent">Challenging industry to provide sustained and high profile efforts to increase parents understanding of age ratings and improved parental controls.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/16">We accept Dr. Byron's recommendations in full and commend Dr. Byron for delivering a groundbreaking report that will make a real difference to children and young people's lives. In particular, we would like to congratulate Dr. Byron for conducting such a thorough and open process, giving all those with an interest an opportunity to engage with the review on this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.13WS.2/17">Government will develop a comprehensive action plan in response to Dr. Byron's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="b.15WS.2/1">I represented the United Kingdom at this month's Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels. The Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Environment, Richard Lochhead, also attended.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.2/2">The Council unanimously adopted conclusions on the Commission's Communication on the &quot;health check&quot; of the common agriculture policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.2/3">The Council also adopted by qualified majority, with the UK voting in favour, a proposal to increase national milk quotas by 2 per cent. in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.2/4">Under any other business, the Agriculture Commissioner also updated Council on the latest state of play in the WTO-DDA negotiations. Along with a number of member states, I expressed our support for the Commission's efforts to reach a balanced conclusion to the current WTO negotiations. France presented a memorandum for debate on competition policy in agriculture to address the organisation of the agri-food sectors. The memorandum calls for greater powers for producer groups to strengthen farmers' interests and ability to regulate supply in the food chain. Along with a number of member states, I underlined our concerns about the possible impact of the proposal on EC competition law.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.2/5">Ireland expressed concerns about the future development of the sheep sector. Poland called for further relief measures in the form of export refunds to alleviate the difficulties currently being experienced in the pigmeat sector. I strongly opposed the use of such measures as there was no evidence on their efficiency in addressing the short and longer term EU pig sector problems, but favoured the use of market-based solutions to address difficulties faced in both the sheep and pig sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.2/6">Cyprus called on the Commission to address the effect of the recent increased feed prices on the production of agricultural products.</p>

	<p pid="b.15WS.4/1">In June last year, the Government launched a fifteen-week consultation on proposals for the CRC, inviting views on how the UK Government and devolved Administrations should implement the UK CRC. The overall response of stakeholders to the consultation document is positive. Stakeholders support the adoption of CRC as a UK-wide scheme and tended to agree with most elements of the Government's proposed approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.4/2">The CRC, scheduled to begin operation in 2010, is a mandatory emissions trading scheme that will cover around 5,000 public and private organisations, including Government Departments, retailers, banks, water companies, hotel chains and local authorities. Combined, these organisations account for around 10 per cent. of the UK economy's CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.4/3">There will be an introductory three-year phase in which the Government is minded that allowances will be sold at a fixed price of &pound;12/tCO2. In the second phase, starting in 2013, allowances will be auctioned. The revenue from both sales will be recycled to participants related to their performance in reducing emissions compared to others in the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.4/4">The UK is committed to meeting carbon reduction targets and to policies that will deliver emissions savings. This new scheme, announced in the energy White Paper, together with the provisions of the energy performance of buildings directive, will have a significant impact on reducing UK CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.4/5">The Climate Change Bill, currently going through Parliament, will provide the legal basis for the scheme. A further consultation on detailed regulations will take place in the summer of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.15WS.4/6">Copies of the report will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.17WS.2/1">The Government's plans to reform the coroner system were set out in the draft Coroners Bill, which was published in June 2006. Extensive consultation since then has helped to refine several policy areas. Today I am publishing a briefing note that explains the policy changes, and compares the revised policy with that set out in the draft Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.17WS.2/2">Some of the changes have been announced already, such as the addition of provisions to strengthen the public protection role of coroners, and a return to the current position on the reporting of inquests. Other changes, such as the scope of the appeals system and inspection arrangements for the coroners' service, will be announced for the first time in the briefing note.</p>
	<p pid="b.17WS.2/3">The briefing note refers to the removal from the Bill of a provision on restricting the reporting of some inquests. Instead, I have been working with the Press Complaints Commission to produce a short discussion paper on how its press code can be improved to protect bereaved families. The discussion paper also considers how the code, and the role of the Commission, can be better brought to the attention of families. This paper is also being published today.</p>

	Financial Assistance Scheme
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-03-27b.18WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" speakeroffice="The Minister for Pensions Reform" colnum="18WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080327/wmstext/80327m0001.htm#08032765000180">
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/1">This statement is an update for the House on the progress made in implementing the changes to the financial assistance scheme (FAS) following the Government announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-17">17 December 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/2" class="italic">Progress made</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/3">The consultation for the first package of draft regulations finished on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-20">20 March</phrase>. Subject to parliamentary passage, those regulations will increase FAS payments to 90 per cent. of accrued pension, and will also enable us to pay people from their normal retirement age, subject to a lower limit of age 60. We are now considering the responses we have had to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/4">We have also consulted on changes we are proposing to annuity factors used in certain circumstances to convert cash sums into rates of notional pension to facilitate the calculation of assistance. This consultation is open until <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-18">18 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/5" class="italic">Next steps</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/6">We are now beginning the next stage of implementing the changes from the December announcement. Tomorrow we will be publishing a second set of draft regulations for consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/7">The second set of regulations contain provision for early reduced payment for certain qualifying members who are unable to work due to ill health; extending the FAS to members of certain schemes which wound up underfunded with a solvent employer; speeding up initial payments; enabling the board of the Pension Protection Fund to advise in the development of the new FAS arrangements; and removing the option to apply for reinstatement into the state additional pension for those eligible for FAS.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/8">To reflect the particular nature of the content the written consultation period for these draft regulations will be a period of six weeks. Although less than the customary 12 weeks, we consider that a six-week period for written consultation provides an appropriate time for stakeholders to consider and respond fully, and will allow us to make the changes as quickly as we reasonably can. We have been in regular contact with stakeholders including the pensions action group, and will be sending the consultation document directly to relevant pension scheme trustees.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/9">Good progress continues to be made and we will maintain the effort required to ensure these changes, and therefore the assistance to scheme members, are in place with the minimum of delay.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/10">The consultation documents are available on the Department's website at</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/11"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2008/FinancialAssistanceScheme(MiscellaneousAmendments)2Regulations2008.pdf">www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2008/Financial AssistanceScheme(MiscellaneousAmendments)2 Regulations2008.pdf</a>, or alternatively via the FAS website.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/12">In the first two packages of draft regulations we have focused on introducing the key parts of the reforms to FAS announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-17">17 December 2007</phrase>: payment at 90 per cent. from normal retirement age; allowing early reduced payment for those scheme members unable to work due to ill health; and allowing certain pension schemes with solvent employers to qualify for FAS.</p>
	<p pid="b.18WS.5/13">There will be a third package of regulations published for consultation later in the year aimed at delivering all the remaining parts of the extension, which will move FAS to a position where financial assistance payments are calculated on a basis which is broadly comparable to that of the PPF.</p>

	Employment and Support Allowance Regulations
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-03-27b.19WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform" colnum="19WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080327/wmstext/80327m0002.htm#08032765000181">
	<p pid="b.19WS.1/1">On behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, I have signed regulations made under Part 1 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007, which are laid before the House today. This is an important set of regulations which provides the benefit structure and rules for the new employment and support allowance (ESA) which will be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.19WS.1/2">This is a further significant step in the Government's welfare reform strategy and addresses a key area for simplification by providing a single income replacement benefit for people who are not working and have a health condition or disability.</p>
	<p pid="b.19WS.1/3">The Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 prescribe the conditions of entitlement and benefit regulations for those who claim on the basis that their capability for work is limited by their physical or mental condition. ESA will be payable in respect of new claims arising from <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October</phrase> and will replace incapacity benefit and income support paid on the grounds of incapacity or disability. Incapacity benefit and income support will continue in payment to existing customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.19WS.1/4">For ESA, new medical and capability assessments, collectively to be known as the work capability assessment, will focus on what a person can do and identify what steps they might take towards taking up work. We intend to apply the new medical test to existing claimants, as their benefit entitlement comes up for reassessment, starting in 2010. We expect all existing claimants to have been assessed using the new test by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="b.19WS.1/5">For the majority of new claimants, ESA will provide, through a series of six mandatory work-focused interviews, the necessary personal adviser and other support to enable them to realise their potential and gain independence by moving into the job market. This will be delivered through the successful pathways to work initiative, which will be extended and available nationally from next month and which has already helped over 64,000 people into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.19WS.1/6">ESA will be payable to those with the most severe health conditions or disabilities without them having to undertake any mandatory work-focused interviews&mdash;they will be part of the support group. However, no one in the support group will be written off. They will be able to volunteer to receive the same support as the majority of claimants, who will be in the work-related activity group.</p>
	<p pid="b.19WS.1/7">The regulations set out the rates of new benefit and ensure that a single person in the support group claiming income-related ESA will be guaranteed an income of at least &pound;102.10 a week&mdash;&pound;17.60 a week more than the long-term rate of incapacity benefit. This will be done by automatically passporting them to the enhanced disability premium, as part of our commitment to fairness for the most severely disabled.</p>

	<p pid="b.22WS.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and I wish to make the following statement to the House. It concerns the Government's response to recommendations made by the coroners following the inquests into the tragic deaths of Gareth Myatt at Rainsbrook secure training centre in April 2004 and Adam Rickwood at Hassockfield secure training centre in August 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.22WS.2/2">In reply to a letter from His Honour Judge Richard Pollard, who presided at the inquest into Gareth's death, we promised a full response to his recommendations. To that end, we have drawn up an action plan which sets out the measures the Government and the Youth Justice Board have taken, and are taking, in response to Judge Pollard's recommendations and to those of Mr. Andrew Tweddle, who presided at the inquest into Adam's death.</p>
	<p pid="b.22WS.2/3">We are placing copies of the action plan in the Library of the House. Copies have also been made available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. It can also be accessed on the publications section of the Ministry of Justice website at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/publications.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/publications.htm</a>, or the publications section of the Department for Children, Schools and Families website at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/publications">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/publications</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.22WS.2/4">The action plan demonstrates the volume and variety of work that is being done to enhance safeguarding and child protection in the under-18 secure estate. One important strand of that work is the independent joint review of the use of restraint, which is due to report to Ministers of State for Justice and for Children, Young People and Families by <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-20">20 June</phrase>.</p>
