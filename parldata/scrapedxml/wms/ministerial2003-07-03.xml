	<p pid=".23WS.2/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions I am announcing the publication of the 2002&ndash;03 fourth quarter's performance statistics for local authority administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (HB and CTB). A copy of the quarterly statistics for all local authorities in Great Britain has been placed in the Library and has been published on the Department for Work and Pensions website at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/other-stats.html">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/other-stats.html</a></p>
	<p pid=".23WS.2/2">Publishing these statistics is part of our strategy for reforming housing benefit. It is right and proper that the public see how well or how badly their council is doing. We are using these statistics to challenge poor performance and to celebrate improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".23WS.2/3">Statistics for the fourth quarter of 2002&ndash;03 show that across the country performance has improved with processing of new claims dropping from an average of eight and a half weeks between April and June to seven weeks between January and March.</p>
	<p pid=".23WS.2/4">Improvements have also been seen in the number of local authorities performing at and exceeding the performance standard for the processing of new claims and changes in circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".23WS.2/5">The statistics are un-audited and are provided quarterly by local authorities to my Department.</p>
	<p pid=".23WS.2/6">The latest annual audited best value performance information for English local authorities is for 2001&ndash;02 and was published by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-12">12 December 2002</phrase> on the Best Value Performance Indicators website at: <a href="http://www.bvpi.gov.uk/home.asp">http://www.bvpi.gov.uk/home.asp</a>. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".23WS.2/7">The most recent corresponding data for local authorities in Wales are for 2001&ndash;02. These are published on the Audit Commission website at <a href="http://ww2.audit-commission.gov.uk/pis/pi-data-01.shtml">http://ww2.audit-commission.gov.uk/pis/pi-data-01.shtml</a>. A paper copy of the relevant extract from this site has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".23WS.2/8">The most recent corresponding data for local authorities in Scotland are for 2001&ndash;02 and are in the Accounts Commission publication &quot;Performance Indicators 2001&ndash;02: &quot;Benefits, Finance and Corporate Issues&quot;, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.</p>

	Housing Transfer Programme 2003
</minor-heading>

	<p pid=".24WS.4/1">I am announcing today the names of 17 authorities in England which, on a voluntary basis and subject to the approval of their tenants, should be able to proceed with proposals to carry out 26 transfers of all or part of their stock to registered social landlords. I have today placed 19 proposals on the transfer programme whilst holding a place open for a further seven transfers. Together the programme could involve over 125,000 dwellings in large-scale voluntary transfers over two years.</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/2">Authorities on the 2003 programme have decided, with their tenants, to pursue housing stock transfer as their vehicle for reaching by 2010 the Government's decent homes target. They will have made this decision after considering the various options for reaching the target. Housing transfer enables the new landlords to obtain increased investment from private sources to reach and, invariably, exceed the decent home target for the transferred dwellings more quickly than if the properties had remained in local authority ownership. Housing transfer can also bring about higher levels of tenant involvement, ensuring housing services meet tenants' needs and preferences. It can also provide a significant boost to the wide-scale regeneration of the surrounding area. Over time, tenants' rents will be similar to what they would pay to their local authority, due to the Government's policy of bringing greater fairness and coherence to the structure of social rents.</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/3">Housing transfers are voluntary and may only take place if tenants are in favour. The consent of the First Secretary of State is also required before a transfer can proceed and that will only be granted if a majority of tenants who vote in the secret ballot do so in favour of transfer.</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/4">Proposals submitted for the 2003 programme have been of high quality. However some are not as advanced as we would wish to secure a place immediately. Therefore Lambeth (for their Clapham Park Estate transfer), North East Lincolnshire and Tower Hamlets (for their Ocean Estate, Mile End East, Crossways Estate and Leopold Estate transfers) have been asked to develop their transfer proposals further. I am also holding open a place on the programme for Hackney (for their West Haggerston and Kingsland transfer) pending the agreement of a minimum valuation with them.</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/5">As the Lambeth (Clapham Park) proposal involves dwellings located within my constituency, it was assessed independently by Yvette Cooper.</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/6">The authorities that have successfully gained places on the programme, together with the intended recipient RSL, are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/7" class="indent">a disposal by Forest Heath District Council of not more than 2,705 dwelling houses to a registered social landlord;</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/8" class="indent">a disposal by Hartlepool Borough Council of not more than 7,963 dwelling houses to Housing Hartlepool;</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/9" class="indent">a disposal by London Borough of Barking &amp; Dagenham of not more than 111 dwelling houses to Stort Valley Housing Association;</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/10" class="indent">three disposals by London Borough of Islington of not more than 1,314 dwelling-houses on the Tollington Estate to North British Homes, not more than 341 dwelling houses on the Surr Street Estate to Hyde Housing Association and not more than 121 dwelling houses on the Grove Estate to Hyde Housing Association;</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/11" class="indent">two disposals by London Borough of Lambeth of not more than 1,164 dwelling houses on the Stockwell Park estate to The Trust and not more than 683 dwelling houses on the Kennington Park estate to Hyde Southbank Homes;</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/12" class="indent">three disposals by Manchester City Council of not more than 1,013 dwelling houses on the Haughton estate to a registered social landlord, not more than 2,543 dwelling houses on the Woodhouse Park estate and not more than 1,548 dwelling-houses on the Hattersley estate to Peak Valley Housing;</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/13" class="indent">a disposal by Middlesbrough Council of not more than 13,209 dwelling houses to a registered social landlord;</p>
	<p pid=".24WS.4/14" class="indent">a disposal by Peterborough County Council of not more than 10,195 dwelling houses to a registered social landlord;</p>

	Domestic Counter-Terrorism, Security and Resilience
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-07-03.25WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/739" speakername="David Blunkett" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="25WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030703/wmstext/30703m01.htm#30703m01.html_spmin3">
	<p pid=".25WS.2/1">I wish to take the opportunity of the debate on the Intelligence and Security Committee's (ISC) annual report today to provide the House with an update on the progress that we are making in combating terrorism and creating security in the UK. We have had a year of significant progress in developing effective counter-terrorism and resilience measures, focusing on a range of fronts such as threat assessment, infrastructure, exercises and joint working.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/2">I discuss the assessment of threats frequently with the Director General of the Security Service and, as she recently said publicly, we must accept the realistic possibility of some form of unconventional terrorist attack in the western world. This is why we have invested significantly in prevention.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/3">Creating security means investing in good government, effective services and international co-operation in a way that generates trust. This means:</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/4" class="indent">having the right organisational arrangements and involvement of ministers;</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/5" class="indent">being vigilant and well prepared at home (working on border security, having the right equipment and using exercises to train for a range of risks);</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/6" class="indent">tackling terrorism at home and abroad (by seizing and stopping terrorist finance, arrests and detentions where necessary but also working to develop good community relations at home);</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/7" class="indent">ensuring that all States are taking measures to combat terrorism and that terrorist groups can find no safe haven (around the world key terrorist suspects have been detained, many as a result of international co-operation involving the UK agencies); and</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/8" class="indent">strengthening the international structures that we need to maintain this unprecedented level of activity (the UN, EU and G8).</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/9">Our organisational arrangements remain strong. I continue as overall security co-ordinator, with all relevant Ministers working together through cabinet committees. Beverley Hughes is now my deputy across the board on domestic counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/10">We have changed structures when needed in order to strengthen joint working. The creation last month of the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), which brought together those assessing and reporting threat intelligence, is a case in point. But I am determined not to make major structural changes where it would just hinder efficient working and add bureaucracy simply for the sake of a change of name.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/11">I endorse the ISC's high regard for the valuable work of our security Agencies and their numerous successes in counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/12">As I suggested to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-02">2 April</phrase>, the agreement that I signed with the US Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge is leading to unprecedented co-operation between the UK and US Governments.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/13">A joint contact group of US and UK officials led by the Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator met in June and agreed to undertake joint crisis management through a series of table top exercises, leading to a major US/UK exercise in 2005. Work is also taking place on bilateral technology development, such as the opportunities created by biometrics.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/14">At home we have taken major steps to secure our borders. For example through setting up an Iris recognition project, immigration fingerprinting with links to the Eurodac system, forgery detection equipment at ports and extensive use of CCTV and ANPR&mdash;all designed to smooth the flow of legitimate travellers while catching illegal entrants and terrorists suspects. We are also running a trial using passenger information gathered at time of check-in which is checked electronically against our database. Preliminary results are very positive. Such a concept provides a mechanism for routinely pre-screening passengers in advance of arrival. In parallel we are considering all the options for gathering information to carry out a full pre-screening programme for incoming passengers.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/15">Another major step forward is the introduction of routine screening of port traffic for the illicit movement of radiological materials to reduce the threat from nuclear or radiological attack. This is a significant part of the &pound;330 million additional counter terrorism money announced in the Budget, which also funds counter-terrorism projects for the Cabinet Office and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/16">While the most important priority is to prevent attacks, particularly through intelligence work, we are also prepared to deal with any attacks because no amount of preventative action can ever be 100 per cent. sure. A capabilities programme has been set up, following a review by the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit, consisting of 16 workstreams each the responsibility of a lead Department with the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the Cabinet Office having overall management. The capabilities concerned cover personnel, equipment and training, as well as plans and concepts of operations. The aim of the programme is to ensure that the response is in place to deal rapidly, effectively and flexibly with the results of conventional or non-conventional destructive action.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/17">An ongoing programme is equipping and training fire, police, health and other public service personnel for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) resilience. We have already trained 3,700 police officers and by next year will have trained over 6,000 officers to ensure that police forces nationally are able to deal with a CBRN incident. This is the level that the Association of Chief Police Officers has requested to deal with CBRN incidents. Decontamination arrangements have been agreed between fire fighters and health services. Personal protective equipment and training has been provided for ambulance workers and A&amp;E departments. Strategic guidance on decontamination has been in place since February.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/18">But we must not focus on CBRN to the exclusion of 'conventional' terrorism. Many of the recent terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world have been suicide bombs, not CBRN.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/19">Our exercise programme is key to building this resilience to deal with a range of threats. We have one of the world's best counter-terrorism exercise programmes and I am determined to ensure no loss of momentum. The Home Office has sponsored and supported a series of exercises over many years to ensure the UK's response to terrorism is kept to a high standard. A series of live counter-terrorist exercises takes place each year in addition to seminars and workshops in police force areas.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/20">By their nature, these exercises reveal areas for improvement. The lessons learnt are circulated to the agencies and tested in further exercises. Moreover, these exercises are a vital training tool&mdash;they are not just for learning lessons or highlighting areas for improvement. Recent exercises have validated our response to a hi-jacked aircraft, terrorist occupation of buildings and ships, released or threatened release of chemical and biological agents and to a nuclear device.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/21">A programme of local and pan London training exercises and day-to-day procedures testing is underway. One element of this programme is the London Underground exercise. Planning on this, which my right hon. Friend The Secretary of State for Transport will take the operational lead on, is underway for the exercise to take place by the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/22">Physical security has also been improved where needed, such as around major landmarks.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/23">A key weapon in the fight against terrorism is tackling its financing, much of which is through organised crime. Anti-terrorism investigations have benefited from the integration of a terrorist finance strategy from the outset.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/24">Legislation that we have brought in is now paying off. In the last 6 months, two precedents have been set in the fight against terrorist financing&mdash;convictions have been obtained under Section 17 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and cash forfeitures made under the Anti-terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCS). There have been 8 cash seizures under ATCS Act so far this year.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/25">An example of this is an extremist support cell convicted of terrorist finance offences, with two men sentenced to 11 years each and a network disrupted that is thought to have raised in excess of &pound;350,000 through cheque and credit card fraud. In another case, in March, four men were arrested attempting to leave country with over &pound;25,000 which was seized.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/26">Internationally we continue to develop new standards and best practices to counter terrorist financing. We have made significant progress in tracking down and freezing the funds of international terrorist groups. Much of the US$115 million frozen in the UK both before and after <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-11">11 September</phrase> has been unfrozen and made available to the legitimate government of Afghanistan for the reconstruction of that country.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/27">Small projects are also important. For example the Metropolitan police campaign to make small retailers aware that low level credit card fraud can be used to fund terrorism. The free CD and booklet produced by London First in partnership with the National Counter Terrorism Security Office and the Business Continuity Institute, with our endorsement, also advises businesses to contingency plan to survive a range of disaster risks.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/28">The Government are continuing to take firm action to prevent terrorists using this country as a base or recruiting ground. For example there have been a number of arrests here in connection with the suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on 30th April. Detention pending eventual deportation is used where necessary&mdash;15 individuals have been detained under powers in part 4 of ATCS, two of whom have since left the country voluntarily. Detainees have a full right of appeal and the first batch of appeals to be heard by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) started in May and will continue through to the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/29">I will keep powers in legislation under review and make changes if necessary. For example, in the Criminal Justice Bill we are proposing an amendment to schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to increase the maximum period that a terrorism suspect can be held without charge from seven to 14 days, when agreed by a court. A second amendment seeks to align the penalties for passport and driving licence fraud&mdash;an avenue of exploitation for terrorists&mdash;and make both arrestable offences.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/30">We have streamlined the assessment of threats and their communication to the public. Today we are publishing an update of our website, <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/terrorism">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/terrorism</a> including new information on exercises and on warnings and informing the public about terrorist threats. Since its launch the website has received around 320,000 page viewings. Recognising that not everyone has access to or feels comfortable with using a website, we are informing public libraries of the new content and advising them to make print copies available.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/31">I want to re-emphasise the message of balance and of not letting terrorism disrupt daily life. We have lived with threats for over three decades and they will be with us for years, we need to find a way of carrying on normally while taking sensible measures.</p>
	<p pid=".25WS.2/32">We need to remember also that our security can only be assured through a sustained long term effort that includes work to address the political and social conditions that terrorists exploit and to ensure that CBRN materials and know-how do not fall into their hands. This is just as important as building resilience at home. The ISC in their report which we are debating today expressed concerns about collection gaps due to the focus on current crises. The focus needs to be on both current threats and longer term concerns, they are invariably interrelated. I am confident that we have the balance right.</p>

	<p pid=".29WS.4/1">Following General Elections in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-24">24 April</phrase>, which saw the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDM) returned for a third term, the opposition Progressive National Party (PNP) filed election petitions against the results in two of the thirteen constituencies. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-19">19 June</phrase>, the Chief Justice declared the results in both districts void with the result that a fresh election was required in each one. This put the governing PDM in a minority in the Legislative Council. The Chief Minister, the Hon Derek Taylor, asked the Governor to dissolve the Legislative Council and to call a new General Election.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.4/2">The Governor, acting in accordance with the Constitution of the Turks and Caicos Islands, told the leaders of both parties on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-23">23 June</phrase> that he was denying both the PDM's request for a new General Election and the PNP's request for the immediate appointment of their Leader as Chief Minister, and that he would issue writs for by-elections in the two constituencies affected to be held on <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-07">7 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.4/3">This was a difficult decision to take. The Governor weighed the arguments carefully. We support the Governor's decision.</p>

	<p pid=".30WS.8/1">As indicated in my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-24">24 March</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-03-24.1"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1WS</phrase>, it is the Government's intention to implement the four EC Communications Directives by the required deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July 2003</phrase> through the legislation contained in the Communications Bill (particularly Part 2 of the Bill) and the orders and regulations to be made under that legislation. Subject to the remaining parliamentary processes being completed satisfactorily the Government believe that it is still possible for the Bill to receive Royal Assent before Parliament rises for the summer recess and for the necessary orders and regulations to be made in time to ensure that the Directives are implemented by the required date.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/2">The time between Royal Assent and <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase> will however mean that the normal 21-day delay between the making of certain orders and regulations and their coming into effect cannot be observed. The Government regret this, but consider inevitable in order to ensure that there is a smooth transition to the new regulatory regime (which is founded on the EC Directives which have to be implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase>). To alleviate problems which might arise from the short interval between the making of the orders and regulations and <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase>, the Government are today publishing the draft of the Electronic Communications (Universal Service) Order that will need to be made as soon as the Bill has been passed. This draft takes account of comments received during consultations earlier this year, and in parallel with the revised drafts, my Department is publishing a response document summarising the way in which the issues raised in the consultations have been dealt with. As soon as the Order has been made following the passing of the Communications Bill, my Department will inform all those thought to be interested in the matter and will draw attention to any significant changes from the texts being published today.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/3">My Department is also publishing today revised drafts of the Numbering Exclusion Order and the Electronic Communications (Networks and Services) (Penalties) (Rules for Calculation of Turnover) Order together with response documents describing how the responses to the consultations on those documents have been dealt with. As these orders require affirmative resolution of both Houses, the formal drafts will be laid once the Bill has been passed, and affirmative resolutions sought as soon as Parliamentary time permits.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/4">My Department will also publish within the next week a response to the consultation on the draft Electronic Communications Code (Conditions and Restrictions) Regulations, on which consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-19">19 June</phrase>, together with a revised draft of the regulations. Like the Universal Service Order, these regulations will need to be made between Royal Assent to the Bill and the commencement of the relevant provisions, and my Department will therefore also inform interested parties as soon as these regulations have been made.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/5">At least two other orders will also need to be made in the interval between Royal Assent and <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase>&mdash;the First Commencement Order, and the Wireless Telegraphy (Limitation of Number of Licences) Order. The Radiocommunications Agency is currently consulting on the latter draft Order, and the text is available on the Radiocommunications Agency website.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/6">The timetable to achieve Royal Assent before <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase> does however remain very tight and, as previously announced, since it would not be an option to fail to implement the directives by <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase>, if the Bill has not been passed in time the Government would need to bring forward regulations under the European Communities Act 1972 to ensure that our obligations were met. My Department consulted on drafts of these regulations in March, and within the next few days will republish the revised texts of the draft regulations together with a response document summarising how issues raised in that consultation have been dealt with. If the Bill does not receive Royal Assent before the summer recess, the regulations will be made so as to be effective by <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July</phrase>. The interval between the making of the Regulations and their coming into force would also be very short, and accordingly my Department would contact all those thought to be interested in the issue to inform them of the making of the regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/7">Copies of all the documents published today have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and made available on the internet: <a href="http://www.communicationsbill.gov.uk/">http://www.communicationsbill.gov.uk/</a>. Copies of the further documents will be published in a similar manner as soon as they are available. My Department is also informing all those thought to be interested in these issues of the publication of the documents. Anyone who has not received personal notification of the publication of the drafts and who wishes to be informed of the further action should contact the Department (at mailto:communications.billconsultation@dti.gsi.gove.uk to ensure they are added to the list of interested parties.</p>

	<p pid=".32WS.1/1">I very much welcome BNFL's announcement today of the appointment of Michael Parker as their new Chief Executive. He has a broad range of experience in challenging and senior posts in Dow Chemical. I would also like to pay tribute to Norman Askew, whose contribution to BNFL's progress over the last few years has been immense. He passes on excellent work on which to build a successful future.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.1/2">I am announcing today that the Government and the BNFL Board have agreed to conduct a joint review of BNFL's future strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.1/3">There have been significant developments in BNFL's key businesses, the nuclear industry and in the Government's efforts to encourage a competitive clean up market in the UK since 2001. On this basis, the Government has decided that a flotation of the company after the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has been formed should no longer be an option. The review will evaluate options for alternative strategies. It will be conducted against the framework of the Government's policy objectives set out in the White Paper &quot;Managing the Nuclear Legacy&mdash;a Strategy for Action&quot; and in particular the need to develop a competitive market for nuclear site management which is fair and open.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.1/4">One of Michael Parker's key early challenges will be to lead the BNFL team working on the review with the Government. The review's output will be recommendations to Ministers on alternative strategies, with the aim of building on the company's progress towards improved performance across its businesses. In the meantime BNFL will continue to give top priority to improving the performance of its clean up and related operations.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.1/5">I have asked the review team to report to the BNFL Board and to me in the Autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".33WS.5/1">I am today publishing a document which sets out the changes that the Government propose to make to the distribution of National Lottery Funds.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.5/2">The lottery has been a huge success. Over &pound;14 billion has been raised for good causes since 1994. However, nine years on from when the lottery started there is a need to revitalise the way lottery money is distributed. That is why last year I published a consultation document to consider how lottery distribution can be made more strategic and streamlined, and importantly how it can remain responsive to public need.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.5/3">Ultimately our proposals are driven by the need to reconnect people with the Lottery. To ensure that people are aware of, and can have greater influence over, how their money is spent And to make it much easier for everyone to apply for and to use Lottery money.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.5/4">The document sets out proposals for involving the public more and responding to people's priorities. It also describes in more detail how we will create a new Lottery distributor, merging the Community Fund and New Opportunities Fund. This new distributor will also take on some of the powers of the Millennium Commission, including the ability to fund big transformational projects of national significance. We also propose ways to improve the management of issues and projects which cut across Lottery distributors, including proposals for a new Lottery forum with a formal mandate to take forward more joined up working. We will create a more unified promotional approach to make clear the link between the Lottery game and the money going to good causes, and more streamlining of the application process for grants.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.5/5">I believe that these changes will enable us to build on the success already achieved and secure the Lottery's position for the future. These changes will require legislation and we will bring forward proposals as soon as Parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.5/6">I have placed copies of the National Lottery funding decision document in the Libraries of both Houses and the text is also available on the DCMS Departmental website at <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">http://www.culture.gov.uk</a>./</p>

	<p pid=".34WS.1/1">I am today publishing a document, which sets out the changes that the Government proposes to make to the licensing and regulation of the National Lottery.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.1/2">Our National Lottery is one of the most successful in the world. After ten years and two licensing rounds, however, we cannot assume that current arrangements will continue to give the best outcome for good causes. That is why last year I published a consultation document to consider whether there might be scope to reinvigorate competition to run the Lottery. The licensing proposals set out in the document are intended to take effect after the end of the current Lottery operating licence in January 2009. The Government recognises the importance of stability and continuity to the operation of the Lottery. These proposals therefore allow time for legislative changes to be brought forward and for the National Lottery Commission to begin early preparations for the new competitive arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.1/3">The document proposes a radical new approach to licensing the National Lottery. It will move away from a requirement for a single major licence competition every seven years.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.1/4">We will strengthen the National Lottery Commission as regulator, and it will have the ability to offer for competition a range of licences to run different parts of the Lottery. We would also allow for licences of different lengths. The Commission will decide the scope of the competitions and the length of the licences before the end of Camelot's current licence. The Commission will exercise its independent judgement in making these decisions, taking account of developments in technology and market conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.1/5">I believe that these changes will enable us to build on the success already achieved and secure the Lottery's position for the future. They should not be taken as criticism either of Camelot or the Commission, both of whom have worked hard for the benefit of good causes within the constraints of the current statutory framework. The Government will bring forward legislative proposals as soon as Parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.1/6">I have placed copies of the decision document in the Libraries of both Houses and the text is also available on the DCMS Departmental website at <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">http://www.culture.gov.uk</a>./</p>
