	<p pid="b.127WS.2/1">My right hon. and noble Friend, the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, has made the following written ministerial statement in the other place today, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.127WS.2/2" class="indent">&quot;I am pleased to announce the launch of the dedicated drug court pilot. Under this model the same magistrate or district judge who gave a drug treatment order will be responsible for management of the offender during their reviews and to the point of completion. In the event of a breach of the order the same sentencing panel will consider the options available for re-sentence for the original offence committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.127WS.2/3" class="indent">By increasing continuity in the process, from the court and also from local partner agencies, offenders will be encouraged to complete the orders and become rehabilitated members of society.</p>
	<p pid="b.127WS.2/4" class="indent">The project will run for 18 months and will collect data from West London and Leeds Magistrates' Courts. It is hoped that by the end of the trial period there will be sufficient evidence that proves that this model is effective in reducing re-offending. If this model is successful my Department will recommend rollout to appropriate areas.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.131WS.4/1">Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires me to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on my exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>
	<p pid="b.131WS.4/2">The 2005 Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. During the 3rd period (<phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-10">10 December</phrase>) I made four orders on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November 2005</phrase> and one order on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase>, all five were made with the permission of the court under section 3(1)<i>(a)</i> of the 2005 Act.</p>

A right of appeal exists in section 10 of the 2005 Act against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an obligation contained in a control order. This has not been exercised in respect of these refusals.</p>

	<p pid="b.132WS.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that the pledges on Africa and development made at the G8 summit at Gleneagles in July are implemented, and progress has already been made. At the international level, implementation will be monitored by the Africa Partnership Forum, as well as by the G8 group of countries and the EU. The Gleneagles Implementation Plan for Africa&mdash;a copy of which I am placing in both Libraries&mdash;sets out the Government's views on the key milestone which need to be achieved on Africa and development in the twelve months following the Gleneagles summit. I am pleased that some of these have already been achieved, and the Government are working with their partners in developed and developing countries to ensure that the remainder are achieved as quickly as possible. This Plan will be updated monthly as further progress is made.</p>
