	<p>I have today placed the independent review of the BBC's digital radio services by Tim Gardam in the Libraries of both Houses. This is the sister document to the independent review of the BBC's digital television services by Professor Patrick Barwise, which I placed in the Libraries on 13 October. Ofcom's assessment of the market impact of the BBC's new digital TV and radio services, which supports both reviews, is available electronically on the Department's website <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p>In response to the review, I have asked the BBC to give me its initial response to the report by the end of November. I will then consider whether further action is needed in the context of charter review.</p>

	<p>We are publishing today the Government response to the ODPM: Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions Committee report on the supporting people programme. We welcome the Committee's report and its reference to the progress that the Government have made in implementing many of the independent review recommendations and the work undertaken to support the 2004 spending review.</p>
	<p>This progress will help to bring stability to the supporting people programme, providing better opportunities for vulnerable people to live as independently as possible in their own home and community. Our work will continue to focus on ensuring that good quality, value for money housing related support services are delivered to vulnerable people, and that supporting people makes a positive difference to their quality of life.</p>

	<p>&quot;The Future of Rail&quot; White Paper (Command Paper 6233), published in July, announced our intention to consider how rail passenger franchises could be best aligned with Network Rail's regional and route structure.</p>
	<p>I am today announcing the first of a reduction in the current number of franchises to 19 in the first instance. This will be a managed process and changes will be introduced as soon as possible after the expiry of existing franchise contracts. Further streamlining will be necessary to further align franchises with Network Rail's operations to facilitate closer working between train and track. These changes would be done in a managed way.</p>
	<p>The changes I am announcing today consist of the following:</p>
	<p class="indent">The formation of a new Greater Western franchise from the existing First Great Western, First Great Western Link (Thames) and Wessex Services, following expiry of current arrangements. The invitation to tender for these services will be issued in summer 2005.</p>
	<p class="indent">Merging the Greater Northern services (left over when West Anglia services of the original WAGN&mdash;West Anglia Great Northern&mdash;franchise were merged into one) with Thameslink. We aim to issue an invitation to tender for these services in Summer 2005.</p>
	<p class="indent">Following the expiry of the current central franchise in 2006, services will be distributed into the Silverlink, Chiltern, Virgin Cross Country, Midland mainline and Northern franchises. We will ensure that, where appropriate, these are put out to competitive tender as soon as possible. The exact nature and timing of these competitions is being finalised to ensure it reflects the needs of passengers and industry.</p>
	<p class="indent">A new franchise incorporating South West Trains and the Island Line, unless it is decided that the needs of the Island Line are not better served by a form of community management as set out in the White Paper.</p>
	<p>Changing the franchise map is part of the commitment to improve the efficiency of our railways. These changes will help ensure:</p>
	<p class="indent">Franchises are aligned as far as possible with Network Rail regions and routes in order to encourage joint working between track and train to deliver an improved service to customers.</p>
	<p class="indent">Efficiency savings through economies of scale are maximised.</p>
	<p>I am also able to announce today that, as stated in &quot;The Future of Rail&quot;, Network Rail will be taking over responsibility for drawing up route utilisation strategies in order to make best use of the network's capacity.</p>
	<p>Currently the Strategic Rail Authority manage this process. The SRA will publish the strategies for the Brighton main line, the east coast main line, the Great Western main line and for the west midlands over the next few months. For all future RUSs the responsibility will be moved to Network Rail.</p>
	<p>These are important steps in implementing &quot;The Future of Rail&quot; White Paper. Ahead of the invitations to tender due to be issued in summer next year the following will have happened&mdash;the industry will have introduced integrated control centres for every route/franchise and will have reformed the network code to improve local decision-making. An RUS will have been completed for each of the tendered franchises.</p>
	<p>These actions will help deliver a streamlined rail industry, that is fit to deliver the improvements the public expect.</p>
	<p>I shall keep the House informed of further developments as we implement the proposals set out in the White Paper.</p>

	<p>I have today placed in the Library copies of the UK's 2004 national action plan for employment.</p>
	<p>The EU treaty requires member states to submit an annual report to the commission that sets out the principal measures being taking at a national level to implement employment policies in the context of the agreed EU employment guidelines. The national action plan responds to this requirement.</p>
	<p>In preparing this plan, the Government have worked closely with representatives from local government and the voluntary sector, as well as the CBI and TUC. This has enabled us to include a broad range of examples showing how the objectives of creating more and better jobs and greater social cohesion are being pursued in the UK.</p>
