	<p pid="a.141WS.8/1">The Minister for Food, Farming and Environment, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, and the Minister for Marine and Natural Environment, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase>, represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-29">29 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/2">The presidency tabled presidency conclusions on the food supply chain in Europe, acknowledging that the distance between member states on issues related to the CAP and competition rules, and the treatment of producer organisations, was unbridgeable. The four dissenting member states-UK, Sweden, Denmark and Czech Republic-all confirmed their opposition to Council conclusions, but noted that there was much common ground on wider aspects of the text.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/3">France recorded a number of observations underpinning the presidency text, while other member states took the floor to support the presidency and to press issues. Commissioner Ciolos, endorsing the presidency text, noted the need for proposals to deal with medium and long-term issues related to the food supply chain, including competition policy. The presidency recorded that while much of the text had been agreed unanimously, unamended presidency conclusions would be adopted with the support of a majority of member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/4">Following discussion on the reform of market management measures for the post-2013 CAP at the February Council, the presidency adopted presidency conclusions, branded informally &quot;trio conclusions&quot; on behalf of the present and incoming Belgian and Hungarian presidencies. The conclusions recorded the prevailing view among Ministers that the current CAP market orientation of was sufficient, and that the existing market management regime should be retained as a safety net.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/5">Commissioner Ciolos observed that the conclusions were merely the beginning of a debate on the future of market management, which would inform the wider debate on CAP reform post-2013. The presidency stated that its conclusions were supported by the majority, and that there would be an opportunity for further discussion of CAP reform at the informal Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-01">1 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/6">Commissioner Ciolos then presented the latest iteration of its quarterly dairy market report, and noted the recovery in the sector since 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/7">Next, the presidency facilitated a discussion on the relationship between Europe 2020 and the CAP, providing Ministers with a questionnaire which solicited their views on the CAP's contribution to Europe 2020 objectives. They also noted that the European Council had adopted a specific conclusion in respect of the relationship between Europe 2020 and the CAP, observing that the CAP &quot;will need&quot; to support Europe 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/8">The Commission noted that Europe 2020 was not intended to undermine existing EU policies. The CAP would continue, subject to reform, and in conformity with the provisions of the Lisbon treaty. The CAP should also meet the three objectives set out in Europe 2020: smart, inclusive, and green economic growth. It also suggested that Agriculture Council should feed the European Council ideas on how CAP reform could feed into Europe 2020 with a view to consideration at the June European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/9">A full table round developed with a predictable split between those member states who believed that Europe 2020 was inexcusably silent on the contribution of the CAP to the growth of the European economy; and those that believed that the CAP would need to prove its worth through reform in support of Europe 2020 objectives. Each camp interpreted the European Council conclusion on the CAP and Europe 2020 as support for its own particular. The presidency concluded that it would be important to consider the Agriculture Council's contribution to the June European Council, where Europe 2020 would be adopted. It would outline its plans in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/10">Under any other business, Italy raised concerns about implementing the 2006 Regulation On Mediterranean Fisheries Management, which was causing serious difficulties for operators and there should be some reconsideration of how this should be done. Commissioner Damanaki was robust in saying that many Mediterranean stocks were not being sustainably fished and that member states had had more than three years to implement this regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/11">Malta, with some support, raised concerns about some member states voting differently to the agreed EU position on bluefin tuna at CITES and the difficult position this had left them in with their fishing industry. Commissioner Potocnik drew some general conclusions, including the need for the EU to up its game on external representation and reserved the right to take all necessary measures in relation to this specific case. The UK registered disappointment that CITES was unable to agree to protect bluefin tuna.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/12">France brought to Ministers' attention the forthcoming agriculture ministerial meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean in Cairo, 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-16">16 June</phrase>, and encouraged Ministers to attend.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/13">Austria presented its paper recording the outcome of the recent OECD agricultural ministerial, highlighting Ministers' acknowledgment of the climate security challenges facing agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.141WS.8/14">Commissioner Ciolos noted that there were no significantly new elements to discuss regarding the WTO/DDA. However, as a new Commissioner, and as agricultural negotiator, Ciolos wanted to reaffirm his own commitment to a balanced conclusion to the round.</p>

	<p pid="a.143WS.1/1">I represented the United Kingdom at the Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-15">15 March</phrase> in Brussels together with the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" name="Joan Ruddock">the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.143WS.1/2">The presidency presented a progress report on the soil framework directive, noting that negotiations remain stalled because a group of member states that includes the UK remains strongly opposed to it. In the discussion that followed, I reiterated the reasons for the United Kingdom's position and highlighted that the fundamental differences of view between member states mean there is a need for a fresh approach to the dossier. Other member states spoke in line with their well-established positions.</p>
	<p pid="a.143WS.1/3">The Council adopted conclusions setting out an EU vision for biodiversity through to 2050, and setting a 2020 target to halt the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems services and to restore these as far as possible. I spoke in support of the conclusions and welcomed the work of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services (IPBES) and the study on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB). I also highlighted the importance of forestry and access and benefit sharing in ensuring an ambitious outcome at the conference of the parties to the convention on biodiversity in Nagoya later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.143WS.1/4">Environment Ministers also exchanged views on the Commission's recently-published communication on the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth, in advance of debate in the European Council later this month. I welcomed the communication's focus on resource efficiency and emphasised that the transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient and climate-resilient economy, which preserves our natural resources for future generations, represents an important opportunity to promote jobs and growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.143WS.1/5">Lunchtime discussion focused on the follow-up to the Copenhagen climate change conference. Following lunch, Ministers agreed Council conclusions on this subject in which EU positions were broadly maintained. My hon. Friend the Minister of State emphasised the importance of working towards a legally binding outcome and in particular making concrete progress towards this in Canc&#250;n. She highlighted the importance of the positive outcomes from Copenhagen and encouraged swift progress on implementing the Copenhagen accord, particularly around REDD+ (the framework for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) and fast-start finance. Ministers continued to show commitment to a global legal framework for reducing emissions, with openness on proposals for achieving it. Mexican Environment Minister Juan Elvira Quesada attended to update Ministers on Mexican preparations for Canc&#250;n, and my hon. Friend the Minister of State intervened in recognition of the Mexican team's dedication and efforts to renew the negotiation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.143WS.1/6">The Environment Council concluded with a policy debate on the proposed regulation on reducing CO2 emissions from light vehicles (for example, vans), during which my hon. Friend the Minister of State emphasised that this proposal is key to reducing carbon emissions from transport. She stated that the regulation must include an achievable long-term target for 2020 and also proposed a short-term target date for 2016, supported by effective penalties and incentives for investment in ultra-low-carbon vehicles. She also highlighted the importance of maintaining competitiveness in the automotive sector through the flexibilities proposed in the regulation.</p>
