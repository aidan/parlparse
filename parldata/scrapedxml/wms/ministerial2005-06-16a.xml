The report gives details of all the provisions examined during the course of the review and sets out the Government's intention in relation to each of them. Of the 183 provisions which were reviewed and found to be within the scope of the power, 13 have already been amended using that power, and a further 59 will be repealed, amended or time-limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.5/4" class="indent">The Government will continue to assess the scope for further amendments or repeals to the remaining prohibitions on disclosure.

	RAF Command Headquarters
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-16a.21WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence" colnum="21WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050616/wmstext/50616m01.htm#50616m01.html_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.21WS.1/1">In the 2004 Defence White Paper, &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot;, we referred to plans to collocate strike and personnel and training command headquarters. This is part of a programme to create a modern, effective and efficient headquarters structure for the Royal Air Force.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.1/2">A study has been conducted into the potential for increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the two headquarters (currently based at RAF High Wycombe and RAF Innsworth) by rationalising and collocating them on a single site. This work was undertaken against the background of the reduction in size of the RAF from approximately 49,000 to 41,000 by 2008 announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-07-21.348"><i>Official Report</i>, column 348</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.1/3">A number of sites were evaluated, including RAF High Wycombe and RAF Innsworth, to determine their relative operational and financial benefits. The study concluded that RAF High Wycombe offers the best value for money and is operationally more effective. I have therefore decided that, subject to trades union consultation, High Wycombe should be the site of the collocated RAF headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.1/4">The study also showed that, as a result of collocation, the headquarters will require some 1,000 fewer posts (500 service, 500 civilian) than the two current organisations. These reductions will contribute to the previously announced wider MOD manpower drawdown. Some 1,350 headquarters posts (600 service and 750 civilian) will be lost from RAF Innsworth. Personnel numbers at RAF High Wycombe will increase from some 2,050 posts now (1,540 service and 510 civilian) to around 2,150 (1,400 service and 750 civilian) by 2008. A number of posts currently based at High Wycombe will move to other RAF units.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.1/5">The target date for standing up the collocated headquarters is October 2006. However, in view of its role in managing the overall draw down in RAF numbers, the personnel management agency will not relocate to High Wycombe until April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.1/6">Part of the RAF Innsworth site is occupied by elements of the armed forces personnel administration agency (AFPAA) currently employing some 540 staff, including contractors. I expect the agency's presence at Innsworth to continue until mid 2008, during which time internal rationalisation unconnected with this announcement will have reduced the number of posts concerned to around 260 (including 170 MOD civilians and 70 contractor staff). The future location of this part of AFPAA is being examined. Unless another defence use is found for the Innsworth site, it will be disposed of once AFPAA relocates.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.1/7">The 200 support staff posts (110 service, 90 civilian) on the site will reduce in line with the overall drawdown.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.1/8">I recognise that this announcement will cause disappointment in the Innsworth area. However, I have to make the best decision for defence as a whole. We are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact on the staff concerned. Our current plans envisage that the civilian reductions, most of which will take place in the Gloucester area, will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early release. If we are obliged to resort to compulsory redundancies, we will endeavour to keep them to a minimum. Staff and the trades unions are being kept fully informed of developments through meetings, briefings and a formal consultation exercise.</p>

	<p pid="a.22WS.2/1">In a statement issued on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-18">18 March</phrase>, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he was establishing a tripartite committee with key stakeholders, to discuss the future of the local government pension scheme. The first meeting of the tripartite committee, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, subsequently met on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-24">24 May</phrase> and was attended by representatives of the local authority employers and the trade unions.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/2">The Committee will focus on the development and modernisation of the scheme and will consider the measures which need to be put in place to ensure the scheme's affordability and sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/3">The Government believe that local authority employees should have a stable, strong pension scheme in which they can have confidence. It is important, however, that the balance is right between, on one hand, the cost of the scheme to the taxpayer, and, on the other hand, the value of the benefits which the scheme offers to current and future pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.22WS.7/1">The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced the terms of reference for the review of the UK climate change programme (CCP) on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-15">15 September 2004</phrase>. These stated that the Government would aim to publish a revised programme in the first half of 2005. I have today announced, through a press notice, that Ministers have agreed to postpone the publication of the revised programme to allow more time for the completion of the appraisal of new policy options. The programme will now be published before the end of the year. This will enable us to produce a programme to put us back on track to achieving the domestic goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. by 2010 and ensure that we can achieve real progress by 2020 towards the long-term goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.7/2">In addition, I am pleased to say that the extended timetable will allow us to take full account of the outcome of a number of other pieces of ongoing work including the energy efficiency innovation review&mdash;important as energy efficiency, both in the domestic and business sectors, may be expected to contribute significantly to future emission reductions. It will also give us more time to take forward the commitments in the 2005 Budget, including how we might support the development of carbon capture and storage, and the commitment in the manifesto to explore the scope for the further use of economic instruments and other measures to promote lower vehicle emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.7/3">The revised timetable will also fit more closely with the timetable for developing phase II of the EU emissions trading scheme. It will enable us to take into greater consideration the level of the cap for the second phase of the EU ETS which is occurring in parallel to the CCP review.</p>

	<p pid="a.23WS.5/2">The 2005 Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. During the first three months of the operation of the Act, I made 11 non-derogating control orders. Ten control orders were made on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase> under section 3(1)(b) and (c) of the 2005 Act in respect of individuals who were at that time certified under section 21(1) of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (the 2001 Act). A further order was made with the permission of the court under section 3(1)(a) of the 2005 Act on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-26">26 April 2005</phrase>&mdash;again in respect of an individual who was formerly certified under section 21(1) of the 2001 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.5/3">I have modified these orders to authorise a change of address in three instances; to give effect to the court's ruling following an appeal&mdash;see below; to give access to further family members in one case; and to clarify the wording of certain obligations in the control orders on two further occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.5/4">A right of appeal exists in section 10 of the 2005 Act against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an obligation contained in a control order. One of those subject to a control order has exercised his right of appeal under this section and has had his appeal upheld. His order has since been varied to substitute different obligations on him.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.5/5">Section 14(2) of the 2005 Act requires the Secretary of State to appoint a person to review the operation of that Act. Lord Carlile of Berriew QC was appointed as the independent reviewer of the 2005 Act on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.24WS.2/1">I have placed copies of the Criminal Justice System Northern Ireland's annual report for 2004&ndash;05 in the Libraries of both Houses, on behalf of the criminal justice ministerial trilateral.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.2/2">This year the report has adopted a thematic approach, detailing progress against six themes: working in partnership; reaching out to the community; responsiveness; reducing delay; confidence in the criminal justice system; and promoting diversity.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.2/3">The report demonstrates how each agency contributes to and supports its partner organisations in the achievement of cross-cutting objectives. Key areas of success include the development of the new causeway information sharing system, progress on the development of the new public prosecution service, the establishment of 26 community safety partnerships, the joint NIPS and PBNI resettlement strategy, and the appointment of lay magistrates.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.2/4">The report demonstrates that all of us, from ministerial level through to frontline staff, are committed to ensuring that the criminal justice system serves the community effectively, in partnership and with integrity.</p>

	<p pid="a.24WS.4/1">I am pleased to announce today the appointment of Professor Monica McWilliams as the new Chief Commissioner of the NIHRC. I am also appointing seven new Commissioners&mdash;Jonathan Bell, Thomas Duncan, Professor Colin Harvey, Alan Henry, Ann Hope, Eamonn O'Neill and Geraldine Rice.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.4/2">These new appointments will join the existing two Commissioners, Lady Christine Eames and Kevin McLoughlin, who were reappointed last autumn to serve until December 2007. The appointments follow an open recruitment process based on merit. The new Chief Commissioner and seven new Commissioners will take up their posts in the early autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.4/3">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is a key part of the architecture of human rights protections in Northern Ireland, and an important feature of the Belfast Agreement. The Government have consistently been clear that it is in all our interests to have a strong, independent and self-confident Commission which draws support from all parts of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.4/4">I am confident that these new appointments will ensure that the Commission will make a significant contribution to the advancement and protection of human rights in Northern Ireland in the coming months and years. I look forward to working with the new Commission.</p>
