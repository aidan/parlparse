<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-09a.153WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence" colnum="153WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070309/wmstext/70309m0001.htm#07030957000051">
	<p pid="a.153WS.5/1">Following the review of the attack helicopter (AH) fielding plan, which sets out how the aircraft and its aircrew are organised and made ready for operations, to determine how best to deliver the Apache attack helicopter capability to the front line, within existing resources, I can today confirm our plans to locate all front-line Apache attack helicopter at Wattisham.</p>
	<p pid="a.153WS.5/2">Currently, the front-line Apache Regiments are based at Dishforth in Yorkshire and Wattisham in Suffolk, where the depth maintenance for all Apaches is undertaken. It has been identified that instead ofthe front-line Apache squadrons being based at two different locations, it would be more effective and efficient to collocate all front-line Apaches at Wattisham. This will be achieved by swapping two Apache Squadrons from Dishforth (656 Squadron and 664 Squadron Army Air Corps) with two Lynx helicopter squadrons from Wattisham (659 Squadron and 669 Squadron Army Air Corps). The move is expected to occur between June and September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.153WS.5/3">Collocation of all front-line AH at Wattisham will enable the technical expertise, logistic supply and maintenance of the aircraft to be managed more effectively, thereby improving aircraft availability. This, in turn, will lead to improvements in delivering AH capability to the front line. Collocation of three Lynx squadrons at Dishforth will yield similar benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.153WS.5/4">Dishforth will revert to a similar dispositionof aircraft that it possessed prior to the introductionof Apache. It is not thought that the exchange of squadrons will materially change the environmental impact of training at Wattisham or Dishforth. It will also have no impact on civilian jobs. The existing infrastructure support arrangements at both sites will remain as they are now.</p>
	<p pid="a.153WS.5/5">The move will affect military personnel to the extent that those posts currently located within the affected squadrons will be relocated. This means that some personnel will transfer between the two sites, although there will be no material impact on overall service personnel numbers at either site. The interest of our military personnel and their families are very important to us and as such, the moves will be managed to ensure minimal impact on them. Most of the relocation process will take place within the normal cycle of postings. All affected personnel are being kept fully informed of the move.</p>
	<p pid="a.153WS.5/6">I have written to the MPs in whose constituency the move will impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.153WS.5/7">Finally, we are reviewing, under Programme Belvedere, our long-term requirements for military helicopter bases in the UK. No decisions have yet been made on this. Further announcements will be made to the House once the programme concludes, to inform on its findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.156WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-13">13 December 2006</phrase> the Government appointed Chris Lewin and Ed Sweeney as external reviewersto the Deregulatory Review of private pensions legislation. The purpose of the review&mdash;initially announced in the May 2006 Pensions White Paper&mdash;is to simplify the private pensions regulatory framework and to reduce regulatory burdens, bearing in mind the need to strike a balance between protecting members' benefits and encouraging employer provision of pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.156WS.2/2">I am pleased to advise the House that Chris Lewin and Ed Sweeney today published a consultation paper with an invitation for contributions by <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.156WS.2/3">A copy is in the House Library. The document sets out the emerging issues and evidence presented so far, with the aim of encouraging further discussion and building consensus on the way forward. I encourage stakeholders to contribute: it is vital that any changes which emerge from the Deregulatory Review strike a balance between member protection and encouraging employer provision of pensions. The consultation paper will be available on the Department's pensions reform internet site later today. Chris Lewin and Ed Sweeney will report to Ministers with recommendations by spring 2007.</p>
