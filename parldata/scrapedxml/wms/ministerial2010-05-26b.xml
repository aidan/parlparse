</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-05-26b.1WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40256" speakername="Mark Hoban" speakeroffice="The Financial Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="1WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100526/wmstext/100526m0001.htm#10052611000209">
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/1">For almost a decade Equitable Life policyholders have fought for a just resolution in relation to losses suffered as a result of regulatory failure. Since 2000 there have been extensive investigations and reviews into what went wrong at Equitable Life. It has been established that maladministration on the part of the Government of the day occurred, and agreement that payment should be made in relation to losses suffered as a result, but the process has taken far too long.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/2">Today, I am confirming this Government's pledge to making fair and transparent payment to Equitable Life policyholders, through an independently designed payment scheme, for their relative loss as a result of regulatory failure. We will set up an independent commission to determine the design of the scheme. While we appreciate the need to implement a payment scheme quickly, the impact and implications of events in relation to Equitable Life are complex, and it is important that our approach is thorough, transparent and fair. As the ombudsman accepted, we also recognise that the impact of any scheme on the public purse must be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/3">I would therefore like to provide an update on the steps we will be taking from here.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/4">In yesterday's Queen's Speech, the Government announced that they will take an important step forward by introducing a Bill to enable payments to be made to Equitable Life policyholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/5">The previous Government asked former Lord Justice of Appeal Sir John Chadwick to provide independent advice on losses suffered by Equitable Life policyholders due to Government maladministration. Sir John was due to present his final report to the Government in May.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/6">We will allow Sir John to complete his work and submit his final report to HM Treasury. Sir John's work brings together over a year of extensive evidence gathering and detailed analysis, including input from a wide range of interests. This work will be useful in helping to inform the development of the payment scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/7">Sir John has requested, and the Government have agreed to, a short extension to this timetable in order to take fully into account two important developments. First, Sir John would like more time to respond to issues raised by the independent actuarial panel appointed to examine the assumptions and methodology used in this provisional advice to him. Secondly, because there has been a significant evolution in his work since his third interim report, Sir John would like to discuss his views with stakeholders before completing his report.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/8">Sir John's final report will be provided to the Treasury by mid July. While Sir John finalises his report the Government will consult with others on the next stage of the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/9">The Government will publish Sir John's report alongside a detailed update, giving next steps towards implementing an independently designed payment scheme. While we believe the design of the scheme should be developed by an independent commission, I can confirm that we are clear about two key points: that there should be no means testing; and that the dependants of deceased policyholders should be included in the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.2/10">I am very aware that there is, understandably, substantial concern in relation to Equitable Life. The Government are working hard to address the situation as quickly as possible, in order to ensure the establishment of an independently designed payment scheme that is transparent and fair to both taxpayers and policyholders. The steps we have announced today are a sign of our commitment to deliver on that pledge.</p>

	Savings (2010-11)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-05-26b.2WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40680" speakername="David Laws" speakeroffice="The Chief Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="2WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100526/wmstext/100526m0001.htm#10052611000210">
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/1">The coalition agreement set out that the Government would make modest cuts of &#163;6 billion to non-frontline services within the financial year 2010-11 to help tackle the UK's &#163;156 billion deficit.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/2">The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have set out this week details of &#163;6.243 billion of savings from Government spending in 2010-11 in line with the coalition agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/3">Spending on health, defence, overseas aid, schools, Sure Start and education for 16 to 19 year-olds has been protected in this exercise, with in-year efficiencies recycled back into budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/4">Outside local government and the devolved Administrations, the savings are allocated across different areas as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/5" class="indent">&#163;1.15 billion in discretionary areas like consultancy and travel costs;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/6" class="indent">&#163;95 million through savings in IT spending;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/7" class="indent">&#163;1.7 billion from delaying and stopping contracts and projects, including immediate negotiations to achieve cost reductions from the major suppliers to Government;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/8" class="indent">&#163;170 million from reductions in property costs;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/9" class="indent">At least &#163;120 million from a recruitment freeze across the civil service for the rest of 2010-11;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/10" class="indent">&#163;600 million from cutting the cost of quangos; and</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/11" class="indent">&#163;520 million by reducing other lower-value spend.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/12">In addition, &#163;1.165 billion of savings will be made in local government by reducing grants to local authorities. Alongside this, the Government will remove the ring fences for over &#163;1.7 billion of grants to local authorities in 2010-11, giving them greater flexibility to find the required savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/13">The devolved Administrations will have the option of either making savings this year or deferring their share of the savings, which totals &#163;704 million, until the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/14">As part of these savings, the Government will deliver &#163;10 million from reducing first-class travel, and will limit the ministerial entitlement to a dedicated car and driver, saving at least one third from the cost of the Government car service.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/15">The savings allocated to each department are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/16" class="indent">Department for Education-&#163;670 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/17" class="indent">Department for Transport-&#163;683 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/18" class="indent">Communities and Local Government-&#163;780 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/19" class="indent">CLG Local Government-&#163;405 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/20" class="indent">Business, Innovation and Skills-&#163;836 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/21" class="indent">Home Office-&#163;367 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/22" class="indent">Ministry of Justice-&#163;325 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/23" class="indent">Law Officers' Departments-&#163;18 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/24" class="indent">Foreign and Commonwealth Office-&#163;55 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/25" class="indent">Department for Energy and Climate Change-&#163;85 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/26" class="indent">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs-&#163;162 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/27" class="indent">Department for Culture, Media and Sport-&#163;88 million (includes responsibility for &#163;27 million of savings from the Olympic Delivery Authority);</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/28" class="indent">Department for Work and Pensions-&#163;535 million;</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/29" class="indent">Chancellor's Departments-&#163;451 million (includes &#163;320 million of savings in annually managed expenditure from reducing the Child Trust Fund);</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/30" class="indent">Cabinet Office-&#163;79 million; and</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/31" class="indent">Devolved Administrations-&#163;704 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/32">Reductions to departmental budgets will be made immediately, and reflected at both the Budget on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June</phrase>, and in Main Estimates, which will go before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/33">The great majority of the &#163;6.243 billion of savings will be used to reduce the deficit. However a total of &#163;500 million will be reinvested as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/34" class="indent">&#163;50 million of Government investment in further education colleges, which colleges will be able to leverage to create a &#163;150 million fund to provide capital investment to those colleges most in need.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/35" class="indent">&#163;150 million to fund 50,000 new apprenticeship places, focused on small and medium enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/36" class="indent">&#163;170 million to safeguard delivery of around 4,000 otherwise unfunded social rented homes to start on site this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/37" class="indent">&#163;50 million for action to tackle backdated business rates bills, including a freeze on payments for 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/38">Barnett consequentials in these areas will be paid at the same time as devolved Administrations make their contribution to the &#163;6.243 billion, making a total of &#163;500 million reinvested savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.2WS.1/39">The savings will be driven by the new efficiency and reform group, whose board will be chaired jointly by the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40322" name="Francis Maude">the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr Maude)</phrase>, and myself. The group will be formed by pulling together existing capabilities, drawing on expertise of officials from across Whitehall. As well as helping Departments to deliver savings, the group will oversee an immediate freeze on non-critical spending on consultancy, advertising, and recruitment of non-frontline civil service staff. The group will be comprised of existing civil servants, and will be located within existing premises, with no additional cost to departmental budgets.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-05-26b.3WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" speakername="Liam Fox" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="3WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100526/wmstext/100526m0001.htm#10052611000211">
	<p pid="b.3WS.2/1">The significant increase in the number of international troops in southern Afghanistan is enabling commanders to make improvements in the laydown and command arrangements of coalition forces in the region. The first of these was the handover of security responsibility for Musa Qala district in Helmand province from UK to US troops on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-27">27 March</phrase>. This transfer allowed UK troops in Musa Qala to be redeployed to the population centres of central Helmand where they have increased ISAF's capacity to protect the Afghan civilian population from the threat posed by the insurgency, and to train and partner with the Afghan national security forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.3WS.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-21">21 May</phrase>, ISAF announced that Regional Command South, the ISAF command responsible for overseeing the operational activity of international forces in southern Afghanistan, will be divided into two separate commands: Regional Command South-West, headquartered in Helmand and consisting of Helmand and Nimroz provinces; and, Regional Command South, headquartered in Kandahar and consisting of Kandahar, Daikundi, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces. The division of responsibility for ISAF troops in southern Afghanistan into two regional commands will ensure that ISAF can continue to provide the optimal level of command and control over its forces as they increase in size from around 35,000 in October last year to over 50,000 troops this summer. Furthermore, the separation of the commands along regional boundaries will align the ISAF military structure in the south with the structure of the Afghan national army, enabling a greater partnering capacity between ISAF and Afghan forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.3WS.2/3">ISAF intends for Regional Command South-West to become fully operational over the course of the summer. The first commander will be Major General Richard Mills of the US Marine Corps, and the US 1 Marine Expeditionary Force, (Forward) which is already based in Helmand, will provide the framework for Regional Command South-West's headquarters component. The UK-led taskforce Helmand will come under Major General Mills's command from <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-01">1 June</phrase>. Subject to final confirmation in due course, the UK and US have agreed in principle that command of Regional Command South-West will be shared on a rotational basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.3WS.2/4">As a further element of ISAF reorganisation in Helmand, and as announced by ISAF last week, the British battlegroup based in Sangin and Kajaki, which comprises in the order of 1,100 troops, will transfer from the UK-led taskforce Helmand to the US-led that is taking on responsibility for the north of the province. Under this arrangement, the battlegroup will not be relocated but for operational purposes it will come under the command of the US. In common with the other changes to ISAF's command structures, the transfer of command in Sangin is intended to optimise the command support available to the troops on the ground in the light of the increase in the number of ISAF troops and other operational assets. The transfer will occur on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-01">1 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.3WS.2/5">The UK has been consulted throughout ISAF's decision-making process and we welcome the changes to the command arrangements that will enable ISAF to make optimal use of the increased forces now deploying in southern Afghanistan.</p>

	Independent Monitoring Commission Report

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-05-26b.6WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40444" speakername="Owen Paterson" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland" colnum="6WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100526/wmstext/100526m0002.htm#10052611000215">
	<p pid="b.6WS.1/1">I have received the 23rd report of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). This report has been made under articles 4 and 7 of the international agreement that established the Commission and it reports on levels of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. I have considered the content of the report and I am today bringing it before Parliament. I have placed copies in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.6WS.1/2">The IMC reported on the continued and significant threat posed by dissident republicans and concluded that they remain highly active and dangerous. During the six months under review, RIRA were responsible for a ruthless and intensive campaign of violence; they committed and publicly claimed one murder and tried, but failed, to murder many others.</p>
	<p pid="b.6WS.1/3">The IMC notes the positive progress on decommissioning by both loyalist and republican paramilitaries prior to the end of the amnesty in February this year. This, combined with the ending of the remit of the IICD by the two Governments, marks an extremely important change, and is a tribute to the great work carried out by the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.6WS.1/4">The Commission also notes that the devolution of policing and justice means that the criminal justice system is accountable to the people of Northern Ireland and as such offers a potent response to paramilitaries by encouraging greater public support and confidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.7WS.7/1">I am pleased to announce that following receipt of the Boundary Commission for Scotland's &quot;Report on the First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries&quot;, and in line with my statutory obligations under paragraph 3(9)(a) of schedule 1 of the Scotland Act, I have today laid a copy of the Commission's report before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.7WS.7/2">The Boundary Commission is an independent body and Ministers have no power to direct the Commission to make changes to any of its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.7WS.7/3">The Boundary Commission's report is accompanied by two DVD-ROMs containing geographical information system data defining the constituency boundaries. This approach was necessary because a number of the recommended Scottish Parliament constituencies have boundaries which do not follow existing local government ward boundaries. Previous parliamentary, and therefore Scottish Parliament, constituencies have been made up of complete local government wards which are defined in existing legislation and can be referred to by listing the ward names. The level of detail required to define the constituency boundaries means that the boundaries could not practically be shown on traditional maps at an appropriate scale. The local government wards (and part wards) which fall within the constituencies are listed in the appendices to the Boundary Commission's report.</p>
	<p pid="b.7WS.7/4">The master copy of the DVD-ROMs has been deposited at my offices in Edinburgh. Reference copies are deposited with the Boundary Commission for Scotland. A copy of the DVD-ROMs is also available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.7WS.7/5">Maps of the boundaries will be available online from the Boundary Commission for Scotland's website or in hard copy by writing to the Commission. Hard copy A2-sized maps are also available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.7WS.7/6">Finally, I intend laying the draft of an Order in Council for giving effect to the recommendations contained in the report before Parliament, as required under paragraph 3(9)(b) of schedule 1 to the Scotland Act 1998, before the summer recess.</p>
