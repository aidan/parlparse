	<p>On 16 December 2004 I announced changes to the future structure of the infantry, including a decision on how we would achieve a reduction by one in the number of battalions in the Prince of Wales's Division. The antecedent components of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment (RGBW) were to merge with, in the case of the Gloucestershire element, the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment (which would also transfer to the Light Infantry) and, in the case of the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment element, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment.</p>
	<p>However, following my announcement, there was a widespread perception that the plan to split the RGBW along the lines of its antecedent parts amounted to the disbandment of the RGBW and the abandonment of its own heritage.</p>
	<p>In view of this, I asked the executive committee of the Army Board (ECAB) to review its original recommendation in relation to the future of the RGBW. In the process of this review, ECAB noted that in formulating its original recommendation on the RGBW it had given insufficient weight to the sense of identity that has evolved during the 10 years since the RGBW was created.</p>
	<p>ECAB concluded that although the substance of the original recommendation&mdash;that the RGBW will form the basis of the reduction by one battalion of the Prince of Wales's Division&mdash;should not change, more could be done to preserve the identity and heritage of the RGBW itself, and not just of its antecedents. ECAB now recommends that this should be achieved instead through an amalgamation of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment with the RGBW. The resulting new regiment will become 1st Battalion the Light Infantry (reflecting the original decision for the D and D to join the Light Infantry).</p>
	<p>I have accepted the need for this adjustment to the original recommendation. The details of how the amalgamation will be taken forward will be a matter for the Army to manage and will be worked out by those concerned over the coming months.</p>

	<p>The Government's public health White Paper &quot;Choosing Health: Making Healthier Choices Easier&quot;, launched in November 2004, set out commonsense steps to prevent unnecessary deaths and help people to make healthier choices.</p>
	<p>The delivery plan for &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, published today, explains how the Government will put these plans into practice. It includes 45 &quot;big wins&quot; which the evidence suggests will make the greatest impact on health. It also covers policies and programmes which will be developed and implemented, targets to improve health, partnerships between industry, the voluntary sector and professional groups, and services delivered by local authorities and the NHS.</p>
	<p>Delivering &quot;Choosing Health&quot; is backed up by two Action Plans: &quot;Choosing a Better Diet: a food and health action plan&quot; and &quot;Choosing Activity: a physical activity action plan&quot;, also published today.</p>
	<p>&quot;Choosing a Better Diet: a food and health action plan&quot; brings together, in one place, all the White Paper commitments relating to food and nutrition as well as further activity across Government. This includes action to improve information to enable healthier eating, restrict further the advertising and promotion of foods to children, increase access to healthier food, simplified food labelling, and improved school food.</p>
	<p>&quot;Choosing Activity: a physical activity action plan&quot; sets out, for the first time, coordinated cross-Government action on promoting physical activity and sport. It highlights the leadership role of the NHS and the importance of close partnership working across sectors, particularly with local authorities, to bring about positive change in activity levels across the whole population. The plan outlines a national framework to complement and support work at a regional and local level. It details an extensive range of departmental commitments such as action to promote active travel through increased walking and cycling, work to improve the physical environment of communities to encourage more active living, and programmes to increase participation in sport and leisure activities.</p>

	<p>I have announced that the &quot;Go-live&quot; date for the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA) will be 1 April 2005. BETTA will bring together Scotland's transmission networks and the network in England and Wales to create a single GB electricity market.</p>
	<p>I have also announced our intention to limit the charges renewable generators on the Scottish islands, and potentially in the far north of the Scottish mainland, will have to pay to the National Grid to transmit electricity to customers across Britain. I am doing this under a power taken in the Energy Act 2004. Exercise of this power will ensure that remote location is no bar to renewable development, which can make an important contribution to the Government's target of having 10 per cent. renewable energy by 2010. We will be consulting on the details of the scheme in the summer.</p>

	<p>The &quot;Future of Rail&quot; White Paper (Command Paper 6233), published in July 2004, announced the intention to establish Network Rail as the single point of responsibility for rail industry performance.</p>
	<p>I am today announcing that Network Rail will take on this role from 4 April 2005. It will help deliver clear accountability for performance and focus the industry's efforts on delivering a more reliable railway for customers.</p>
	<p>The management of the overall performance of the rail network is currently undertaken by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). It tracks and reports the industry's overall progress on improving performance, and collates the detailed public performance measure (PPM) for each train company.</p>
	<p>Working with train companies the SRA has developed specific performance improvement plans to reduce train companies delays. The changes I am announcing today will place that responsibility with Network Rail.</p>
	<p>Network Rail already leads the delivery of national rail industry initiatives to improve performance, such as, resilient timetabling, the establishment of integrated control centres with train companies and the preparations for seasonal operating conditions. It is responsible for day to day operations and getting services back on track following any incidents and delays.</p>
	<p>In future, Network Rail will also regularly track, report and challenge the industry's efforts to improve performance. At a local level, working in partnership with the train companies, the company will develop and put in place joint performance improvement plans, bringing together the currently separate planning arrangements of Network Rail and train companies, and in doing so secure the benefits of closer joint working.</p>
	<p>Network Rail will take on the SRA's role of collecting data on the performance of the railway. Information on performance will be published regularly by the Office of Rail Regulation and Network Rail will be accountable for the performance levels achieved.</p>
	<p>Network Rail's new role is a non-statutory function. Its accountability for overall performance will be underpinned by an amendment to its licence conditions which will set out its role in terms of whole industry performance. The details of the amendments are currently being consulted upon by the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>
	<p>The changes I have announced today are further important steps in the implementation of the &quot;Future of Rail&quot; White Paper. They put in place clear arrangements and responsibilities for the overall performance of the network. They will ensure close joint working between Network Rail and train companies to deliver improved services to the passenger. They will also build on the closer industry co-operation happening now, through the establishment of integrated control centres, that are beginning to deliver impressive results in reducing delays on the network,</p>
	<p>I shall keep the House informed of further developments as we continue to implement the proposals set out the in White Paper.</p>

	<p>On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI focused inspection report on Brentwood borough council was published on 8 March and copies of the report are available in the Library.</p>
	<p>In 2003&ndash;04, Brentwood borough council administered some &pound;11 million in housing benefits, about 19 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p>On 29 January 2004 I announced, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-01-29.18WS"><i>Official Report</i> Column 18WS</phrase>, that BFI would undertake focused inspections to provide quick improvements in performance in specific areas of benefits administration. This inspection concentrated on processing of claims for housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p>Brentwood borough council has made fundamental changes to its benefits service over the past three years, including major restructuring new information technology (IT) systems and implementation of the Department's verification framework. The council recognised that service improvement could only be achieved by developing and retaining the experience of their staff and has been successful in doing this.</p>
	<p>Customer service was clearly a priority and particular efforts have been made to ensure that all evidence to support a claim is gathered. A local initiative to interview all customers who submitted a new claim, or reported changes of circumstances, was unusual but effective.</p>
	<p>The council's close monitoring of the claims process has identified and resolved delays but this scrutiny was undermined by inadequate checks and the limited level of assurance provided by internal audit. Inconsistent working practices, a lack of audit trails and weaknesses in document imaging also detracted from the quality of work.</p>
	<p>A number of successful bids to the Performance Standards Fund and Brentwood borough council's own investment have led to significant improvement in the average time taken to process claims. Steady progress has been made in the speed of processing but quality needs to be improved.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings and recommendations.</p>

	<p>On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI focused inspection report on Copeland borough council was published on 8 March and copies of the report are available in the Library.</p>
	<p>In 2003&ndash;04, Copeland borough council administered some &pound;20 million in housing benefits, 53 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p>On 29 January 2004, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-01-29.18WS"><i>Official Report</i> Column 18WS</phrase>, I announced that the BFI would undertake focused inspections to provide quick improvements in performance in specific areas of benefits administration. This inspection concentrated on processing of claims for housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p>At the time of the inspection in November the council was processing new claims well outside the standard of 36 days and was in the bottom quartile of performance for all councils. Accuracy was poor and the reported performance was in the bottom quartile for this indicator of performance as well.</p>
	<p>Inadequate analysis of the quality of work done, inconsistent management checking and a poor management information system meant that performance could not be monitored effectively and that the council should not identify the reasons for poor performance nor the opportunities to improve.</p>
	<p>Coincidental with the BFI's inspection and in acknowledgement of its poor performance the council is now undertaking an ambitious change programme, and has introduced an interim new structure for the benefits service, implemented a document imaging processing system and moved into new premises. A new benefits IT system is planned for 2005.</p>
	<p>The council has performance standard funding to employ consultants to assist its change programme. Copeland borough council has recognised that staff development, including management training and mentoring, will be necessary to improve its services.</p>
	<p>The council addressed many of the issues identified during the course of the inspection.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings.</p>

	<p>On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Fylde borough council was published on 8 March and copies of the report are available in the Library.</p>
	<p>Following the housing Green Paper &quot;Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All&quot;, published in April 2000, the Department for Work and Pensions developed a performance framework for housing benefits. The performance standards allow local authorities to make a comprehensive self-assessment of whether they deliver benefit effectively and securely. They are the standards that the Department for Work and Pensions expects local authorities to aspire to and achieve in time.</p>
	<p>In 2003&ndash;04, Fylde borough council administered some &pound;12 million in housing benefits, about 48 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p>The BFI inspected the council against the performance standards for housing benefits and finds that the council is not at standard for any of the seven functional areas of the performance standards&mdash;strategic management, customer services, processing of claims, working with landlords, internal security, counter-fraud and overpayments. However, it has strengths in all areas and overall Fylde borough council was performing to a fair standard.</p>
	<p>To deliver strong and enduring improvement the council needs better strategic management, operational targets and performance monitoring systems. It should also seek to encourage the active involvement of senior officers and elected members in benefits matters.</p>
	<p>The council has successfully tackled a backlog of benefit claims and performance has steadily improved since 2003. In August 2004 the council reported that it had achieved the performance standards for processing new claims (36 days) and changes of circumstances (nine days).</p>
	<p>The council provides a high quality service to customers in terms of handling personal callers, telephone enquiries, correspondence and complaints. Customer surveys show a high level of customer satisfaction.</p>
	<p>The council is responsive to the risks of benefit fraud and has experienced and professionally trained staff applying a full range of sanctions and key processes. Arrangements for recovering overpayments are not fully effective, however this weakness has been identified and extra resources have been allocated to reduce the amount of overpaid benefit.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings and recommendations.</p>

	<p>On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Torridge district council was published on 8 March and copies of the report are available in the Library.</p>
	<p>Following the housing Green Paper &quot;Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All&quot;, published in April 2000, the Department for Work and Pensions developed a performance framework for housing benefits. The performance standards allow local authorities to make a comprehensive self-assessment of whether they deliver benefit effectively and securely. They are the standards that the Department for Work and Pensions expects local authorities to aspire to and achieve in time.</p>
	<p>In 2003&ndash;04, Torridge district council administered some &pound;10 million in housing benefits, 31 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p>BFI inspected Torridge district council against the performance standards for housing benefits and finds that the council is not at standard for any of the seven functional areas of the performance standards&mdash; strategic management, customer services, processing of claims, working with landlords, internal security, counter-fraud and overpayments. Torridge district council is in the bottom 15 per cent. of all local authorities for claims processing performance and is providing a poor service overall.</p>
	<p>The benefits service has been given a low priority within the council for several years and this is reflected in its consistently poor overall performance. There is a lack of effective management at strategic and operational level, and members and senior managers have failed to address weaknesses that have been apparent for at least two years.</p>
	<p>Service improvements have been hindered by the lack of a strategic service delivery plan and formal policies and procedures. Managers have been running the service with limited management information and checks.</p>
	<p>Coincidental with the inspection a reorganisation of benefits services had taken place and the case for additional resources was being addressed. There is now a commitment to improve the service provided to customers.</p>
	<p>While good progress has been made in countering fraud, little is done to recover overpayments.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings and recommendations.</p>

	<p>On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI Race Relations Act update report was published on 8 March and copies of the report are available in the Library.</p>
	<p>All inspectorates are to promote compliance with the Race Relations Act. BFI published its first Race Relations Act report in May 2003 on the extent to which 10 randomly selected local authorities' benefit services complied with the requirements of the Race Relations Act, as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Since then BFI has worked with the Commission for Racial Equality and the Department for Work and Pensions to ensure that the requirements of the Race Relations Act were incorporated in performance standards for the administration of housing benefits.</p>
	<p>This second BFI report in this important area is based on 15 BFI inspection reports published since May 2003. It shows that no local authorities were meeting all the criteria relating to the Race Relations Act as set out in performance standards. At the time of BFI's inspections, four of the 15 local authorities had assessed the impact of proposed policies, or monitored the impact of existing policies, on race equality and two local authorities that failed to meet this requirement had a large ethnic minority population.</p>
	<p>The report notes that eight local authorities had not provided training on the requirements of the Race Relations Act. However, areas of good practice were identified in the 15 local authorities and BFI is pleased to report there was widespread compliance with the requirement to produce a race equality scheme.</p>

	<p>On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI good practice review of Rotherham Metropolitan borough council was published on 8 March and copies of the report are available in the Library.</p>
	<p>In 2003&ndash;04, Rotherham metropolitan borough council administered some &pound;60 million in housing benefits, 15 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p>The BFI helps to improve the effectiveness and security of benefits administration by disseminating good practice. Good practice reviews identify practices and procedures that can help other councils. This report identifies and describes the good practices the BFI found in Rotherham metropolitan borough council's administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p>The BFI found that a partnership between the council and British Telecom (BT) provided the benefits service with a clear strategic purpose and modern IT conducive to a more effective service to customers.</p>
	<p>Rotherham is in the top quartile of all councils for the speed of processing new claims and changes of circumstances. This strong performance was maintained during the implementation of the verification framework. Proactive case management, using accurate management information, has enabled managers and team leaders to identify potential processing delays and take appropriate action. On top of this, considerable improvements have been made to prevent, deter and detect fraud by introducing comprehensive counter-fraud policies and using the full range of sanctions. Other councils may well be able to learn from Rotherham's approach.</p>
