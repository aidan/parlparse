<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-10-10a.11WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="11WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061010/wmstext/61010m0001.htm#061010148000020">
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/1">The Government are strongly committed to tackling terrorist financing. Just as there should be no hiding place for those who perpetrate terrorism, so there should be no hiding place for those who finance terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/2">This statement updates Parliament on counter-terrorist finance actions taken over the summer recess to strengthen further our framework for rooting out the financial networks underpinning terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-10">10 August 2006</phrase>, the police arrested a number of suspected terrorists in connection with an alleged plot to blow up airplanes leaving the UK in mid-flight. Acting on the advice of the police and the Security Service, the Treasury froze the assets of 19 of these individuals on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-11">11 August</phrase>. The asset freeze was imposed within 24 hours of the police arrests and was in place before banks opened in the morning. This was the quickest and most comprehensive asset freeze that the Treasury has undertaken and it has yielded valuable operational benefits. The Executive Secretary of the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has said in relation to the <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-11">11 August</phrase> freeze that:</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The measures taken (by the Treasury) were exemplary, this is a concrete application and implementation of FATF standards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/5">This latest action means that a total of 188 accounts and around half a million pounds of suspected terrorist funds have now been frozen in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/6">The measures set out here are designed to help to detect, deter and disrupt money laundering and terrorist finance, while safeguarding the UK's position as the world's most secure and dynamic financial sector. The Treasury plans to produce a detailed strategy document around the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/7" class="italic">Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/8">Today, the Treasury is asking the Privy Council to adopt a new Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order updating the existing order. This makes a number of changes to the UK's domestic asset freezing regime, allowing us to prevent funds, economic resources and financial services being made available to anyone who is designated under the order on suspicion of involvement with terrorism, while introducing a confidentiality provision to protect, where necessary, information that may be disclosed on a confidential basis</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/9" class="italic">Closed Source Evidence</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/10">The Treasury has agreed, on the advice of law enforcement agencies, to use closed source evidence in asset freezing cases where there are strong operational reasons to impose a freeze, but insufficient open source</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/11">evidence available. The use of closed source material will be subject to proper judicial safeguards. The Government intend to put in place a special advocate procedure to ensure that appeals and reviews in these cases can be heard on a fair and consistent basis. In order to ensure appropriate accountability to Parliament, we will report to Parliament quarterly on the operation of the UK's asset freezing regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/12" class="italic">Money Service Businesses</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-29">29 September</phrase>, the Treasury published a review into the regulation and performance of money service businesses in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. The vast majority of bureaux de change, cheque cashers and money remitters are honest and important partners in the fight against financial crime. But the scale of the challenge we now face demands we strengthen our current financial controls so that we can root out money laundering and terrorist financing. Our proposals to replace the registration system with a licensing system, take tougher action against non-compliance and demand firms keep better records, build on the controls we introduced five years ago and give us the powers we need. I also want to give firms in the sector better support and guidance and recognise the important contribution they make to our financial system at home and abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/14" class="italic">State Benefits</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/15">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July</phrase>, I made a statement to Parliament announcing that the Government would be restricting the payment of state benefits to the households of UN listed terror suspects. This policy has now been applied to six households. Following a legal challenge, the High Court ruled on<phrase class="date" code="2006-09-22">22 September</phrase> that the Government's approach was lawful and was consistent with its obligations under the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/16" class="italic">Charities</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/17">In February, the Government launched a review into the regulation and performance of the charitable sector in preventing terrorist financing and will make recommendations later this year for protecting the charitable sector from terrorist infiltration. It is essential that charities are protected from abuse by terrorists seeking to exploit the goodwill of donors. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-24">24 August</phrase>, the Charity Commission, having consulted Treasury and Home Office Ministers, launched an enquiry into the charity crescent relief and froze its bank accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/18" class="italic">Third Money Laundering Directive</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/19">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July</phrase>, the Treasury published a consultation document on implementing the EC Third Money Laundering Directive. This will ensure our systems for tackling money laundering and terrorist financing continue to be in line with international best practice and will implement a risk-based approach, allowing businesses to target their resources in the most effective and proportionate manner. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="">20 October</phrase> and we will report the results when we publish draft Regulations around the turn of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/20" class="italic">International Action</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/21">Because terrorist financing operates globally, so the response must be global. Last year, the UK used its presidencies of the G7 and the EU to step up international action against terrorist financing. The Chancellor will, today, write to EU finance ministers about taking this agenda forward. The UK has recently been appointed</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/22">to serve as president of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) from summer 2007. We will use our presidency to drive forward a reform agenda urging the FATF to be more outward looking and more clearly focused on tackling abuses and risks in the international financial system.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-10-10a.18WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Transport" colnum="18WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061010/wmstext/61010m0002.htm#061010148000084">
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/1">I will attend the first Transport Council of the Finnish presidency which takes place in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="">12 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/2">The main items on the agenda are: the mid-term review of the 2001 White Paper on transport policy; the Galileo satellite navigation project; the draft regulation on aviation security; and two aspects of aviation external relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/3">There will be a policy debate on the mid-term review of the Commission White Paper on European transport policy. The review, entitled &quot;Keep Europe Moving&mdash;Sustainable Mobility for our Continent&quot;, appeared in July. It reviews the EU's transport objectives between 2001 and 2010, as set out in the 2001 White Paper. Evident in the review is a change of emphasis, the aim now being to get the best from each transport mode, rather than seeing present and future policy in terms of conflict between road and rail. Key themes are better regulation, competitiveness, transparency, innovation and logistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/4">The UK's overall aim is to ensure continued emphasis on reducing regulatory burden, ensuring the proper working of the internal market and protection of the environment. This means that new Commission proposals should be based upon a rigorous impact assessment; that the rules of the internal market are monitored to see that they are working properly; that liberalisation of the domestic passenger rail market is</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/5">treated as a priority; and that measures such as aviation emissions trading are brought forward to help mitigate environmental damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/6">There will be a report from the Commission on its Communication on freight transport logistics, entitled &quot;Freight Logistics in Europe&mdash;Key to Sustainable Mobility&quot;. The Communication &quot;examines whether and where the EU could offer added value to enhancing the development of freight transport logistics in Europe and the world&quot;. The Commission plans to present an action plan for freight transport logistics in 2007. The Finnish presidency will take forward consultation on the communication and prepare for the action plan. Logistics is Finland's central presidency priority in the transport field. The UK supports this initiative from the Commission and the proposal to develop an action plan. However in future discussions on the action plan we will need to ensure that any regulatory proposals that emerge are proportional and supported by industry needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/7">The presidency will aim for a general approach on two draft regulations related to management of the Galileo programme. The first amends the statutes of the Galileo Joint Undertaking (Regulation 876/2002 EC) to allow for its closure at the end of 2006; the second amends the regulation (1321/2004 EC) which established the Galileo supervisory authority, allowing it to take over the joint undertaking's responsibilities for the current development phase. The UK supports these amendments, which aim to ensure that an appropriate management structure is in place, with an efficient transition of responsibilities for managing the Galileo programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/8">The Council will consider conclusions on the Commission communication of June 2006, taking stock of the Galileo programme. We believe these provide a useful reinforcement of our objectives for the programme. The Commission is also expected to report on progress in the PPP concession contract negotiations, and possibly on its delayed deliberations on the involvement of third countries in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/9">We will examine the emerging deal very carefully for its justification in terms of value for money, affordability, and risk to the public sector. We are also pressing the Commission to bring forward proposals for the new financial mechanisms which will be needed. A successful PPP should deliver a value for money deal and ensure that all member states are in a position to participate in the potential economic benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/10">The Council will aim to reach political agreement on the regulation on civil aviation security, replacing and improving on the 2002 regulation. The new proposal would help to clarify, simplify, and further harmonise legal requirements with the aim of enhancing overall security in civil aviation. Early agreement on the proposed new regulation is highly desirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/11">In addition, under AOB, there will be reports from the presidency and the Commission on recent developments in aviation security.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/12">The Commission will give progress reports on two aspects of aviation external relations on which it has been given mandates to negotiate agreements&mdash;with the US on a comprehensive air transport treaty, and with Russia on payments for Siberian overflights. Both issues remain the subject of on-going discussions with the respective Governments.</p>
