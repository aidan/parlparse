	<p pid="a.69WS.5/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that by 2008 no one will wait for more than 18 weeks from GP referral to hospital treatment. Reducing waiting times for diagnostics is central to delivering the 18 week pathway. The first step in eliminating diagnostic waits is to be able to measure them.</p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.5/2">The following statistics are released today by the Department of Health:</p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.5/3" class="indent">NHS diagnostic waiting times: month ending <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.5/4" class="indent">NHS diagnostic waiting times: months ending <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.5/5" class="indent">NHS diagnostic waiting times: biannual census of diagnostic tests, end February 2006</p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.5/6">This first publication of diagnostic waiting times figures will become a regular monthly release. This information can be found on the Department's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.5/7"><a href="http://www.performance.doh.gov.uk/diagnostics/index.htm">http://www.performance.doh.gov.uk/diagnostics/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.5/8">Measurement of diagnostic waiting times will enable the NHS and the Department to identify bottlenecks in the system and solutions to deliver the 18 week pathway.</p>

	<p pid="a.70WS.2/1">I am today laying before Parliament, with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the annual report and accounts for 2004-05 for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. It is being laid before the Scottish Parliament by the Scottish Ministers jointly. The annual report and accounts will be published by <phrase class="date" code="">21 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.70WS.2/2">The annual report and accounts describes the activities of the authority in paying financial compensation to victims of violent crime, under the terms of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.70WS.2/3">Publication of the annual report and accounts is later than usual because of the need to bring the accounting for the tariff scheme cases fully in line with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 12 (provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets). The accounts estimate the final settlement value of cases in progress and the predicted value of applications which have not yet been received in respect of crimes that have already occurred. As a result, the balance sheet at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> shows net liabilities of &pound;1,257 million and an operating deficit of &pound;46.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.70WS.2/4">In 2004-05 the authority received 66,290 applications for compensation and resolved 66,898. The number of cases outstanding at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> was 84,581. The proportion of cases decided within 12 months was 73.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.71WS.2/1">The Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive has the laudable aim of minimising the environmental impact of waste electrical and electronic equipment by restricting the amount of hazardous substances in any new equipment placed on the market from <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/2">The RoHS directive draws its scope or coverage from the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which was negotiated and adopted at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/3">The scope of both directives is very broad and was primarily intended to include consumer electronic and IT equipment, large and small domestic appliances and mobile phones.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/4">It was certainly never envisaged that the directives would apply to church and other pipe organs, although there was some legal uncertainty in the final text.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/5">At the UK's instigation the matter was raised at a meeting of EU member states (the Technical Adaptation Committee) that is chaired by the European Commission, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-26">26 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/6">Following this meeting, the Commission has clarified that pipe organs are outside the scope of the new rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/7">I am, therefore, very pleased to confirm that the legal uncertainties have now been resolved and pipe organs are considered to be clearly outside the scope of the RoHS and WEEE directives.</p>
