<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-10-30a.1WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" speakeroffice="The Minister for the Middle East" colnum="1WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061030/wmstext/61030m0001.htm#06103038000012">
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/1">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-14">14 October 2006</phrase> unanimously adopted UNSCR 1718 (2006) under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The Security Council's rapid and decisive action, in response to DPRK's nuclear test on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October</phrase>, sends a strong signal to the DPRK Government that the international community will not tolerate its irresponsible and provocative actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/2">The resolution is targeted at stopping the DPRK's WMD and missile programmes and changing the behaviour of the regime in Pyongyang. We now expect the DPRK to comply with the resolution and return to the six party talks without pre-conditions. If it does comply fully with the resolution's provisions and if the talks resume successfully, the UK would expect the Security Council to lift the measures imposed by the resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/3">The resolution backs these demands by imposing sanctions against the DPRK. All states have a legal obligation to comply. The individual sanctions comprise an assets freeze and travel ban on individuals and entities involved in or supporting DPRK's nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes; a ban on making funds available to those individuals and entities; a ban on the export or supply of certain substantial military items, nuclear materials, missiles and sensitive technologies; the export of luxury goods; the provision of any technical assistance, training or other advice in relation to the military or nuclear/ballistic-missile items and the procurement of any of the sensitive items so that DPRK can not export proliferation-sensitive technologies to other countries. The resolution also includes a provision calling upon states to inspect cargo going to and from DPRK subject to action being in conformity with international law and member states' own national laws, where such action is necessary to prevent illicit trafficking in prohibited goods and materials.</p>

	<p pid="a.1WS.5/1">A report was commissioned of the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Dr Stephen Ladyman, and the then Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, Department for Education and Skills, Margaret Hodge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/2">The Chief Medical Officer was asked to consider the role of medical expert witnesses in relation to family law cases and in particular to examine the experts' participation throughout the process, and the competencies needed; to examine evidence of best practice for expert witnesses; to identify a template and portfolio of medical skills by which a practitioner may be regarded as competent to offer evidence, and to advise on a sustainable supply of competent, quality-assured expert medical witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/3">Sir Liam reported to Ministers at the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills in 2005, in his independent capacity as Chief Medical Officer for England and chief medical advisor to the United Kingdom Government. I have been considering the next steps, in consultation with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills (Parmjit Dhanda) and the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs (Harriet Harman), and we are pleased to announce that we have decided Sir Liam's report should form the basis for a consultation document, and be published for a period of public consultation. The report has been placed in the Library and is available on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/Consultations/LiveConsultations/fs/en">http://www.dh.gov.uk/Consultations/LiveConsultations/fs/en</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/4">It is of paramount importance that we secure medical expertise in family law proceedings in the interests of children and families whose future lives depend upon the integrity and quality of judgments delivered in public law Children Act cases. I hope and expect that the consultation process will draw responses from the widest spectrum of interested parties and organisations who are affected by, and who work with and within the court system.</p>

	<p pid="a.2WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June</phrase> I was pleased to announce new funding of &pound;27 million spread over three years for children's hospice services. Applications for the Children's Hospice and Children's Hospice at Home Grant have now been considered by a group which included key stakeholders and I am pleased to announce that 35 hospice services successfully applied for grants and will benefit from this funding. The payments will be made as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/2">At the same time as announcing this grant I announced a review of children's hospice services and subsequently announced in a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-18">18 September</phrase> that the review had been extended to consider the long term sustainability of children's palliative care services and funding more generally. I am pleased to announce that Professor Sir Alan Craft and Ms Sue Killen have agreed to lead this important review. The consultation phase of this review commenced in October and contributions are being sought. Contact can be made with the review team at childpalliativecare@dh.gsi.gov.uk. I expect the review to be completed by spring 2007.</p>
