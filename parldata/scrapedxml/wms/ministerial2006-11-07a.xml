	<p pid="a.33WS.2/1">In line with measures I announced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October</phrase> regarding the strengthening of counter-terrorist financing frameworks, the Government will be seeking the agreement of the Privy Council on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase> for the adoption of two Orders in Council concerned with giving effect to UN financial sanctions regimes against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and North Korea. The Government strongly support international efforts to tackle abuse of financial systems and these new orders will further enhance the UK's ability to play its full part in these international actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/2" class="italic">Al-Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/3">UN financial sanctions against persons associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban are currently given effect in the UK through the al-Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2002. The new Order will update these earlier provisions, bringing them into line with the new Terrorism (United Measures) Order 2006 that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-12">12 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/4">The Al-Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 will further strengthen our powers to freeze assets, including the property of persons listed at the United Nations under the relevant UN Security Council resolutions or who we suspect are persons acting on their behalf, and to prevent funds or economic resources being made available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/5" class="italic">North Korea (United Nations Measures) Order 2006</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/6">Following North Korea's announced nuclear test, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-14">14 October 2006</phrase> to adopt resolution 1718 (2006), which calls upon all member states to impose sanctions against North Korea's nuclear, ballistic missile and other weapons of mass destruction-related programmes. The North Korea (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 will give effect to the financial sanctions measures set out in resolution 1718.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/7">Consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions and with other financial sanctions legislation, both Orders in Council include provisions to allow the Treasury to license exemptions to the restrictions to meet legitimate humanitarian needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.36WS.2/1">I am publishing today the Government's response to the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee report, of <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August</phrase>, on &quot;Reform of the Coroners' System and Death Certification&quot;. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It will also be made available on the Department for Constitutional Affairs website.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/2">The draft Coroners Bill was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June</phrase>. In the Bill we aim to do three things. First we will improve the way that the system serves the public interest and meet bereaved families' concerns. The Bill will give families involved in the inquest process a clear legal standing in the system. We will also give families new rights through a new complaints and appeals system, enabling them to challenge a coroners' decision, and the introduction of a Charter for Bereaved People which lays out the level of service families can expect. Secondly we will strengthen coroners' work. The Bill will establish a proper appointments system for coroners, who will have to be legally qualified and will have to work full time as coroners, instead of having another job and working part time as coroners. Thirdly, we will create a national structure for coroners' work. For the first time there will be a chief coroner who will provide national leadership for coroners, as the Lord Chief Justice does for judges. This will be supported by national standards, a coronial advisory council, a proper inspection system and national training for coroners and their officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/3">I would like to thank the Committee for its thorough inquiry into our proposals to reform the coroners system, as set out in the draft Coroners Bill and for the additional consideration it gave to death certification. The Government regard pre-legislative scrutiny as a vital step in the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/4">Our public consultation exercise on the Bill has almost concluded. We are considering very carefully the views put forward about our proposals before finalising the Bill for parliamentary introduction as soon as time allows.</p>

	<p pid="a.37WS.0/2">The annual number of junior/middle management officers in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) who have taken redundancy through the CER or CES schemes for the years 1997 to 2006 are shown below and include efficiency restructuring in FCO Services. Costs shown for the years 1997 to 2001 are the total for all early retirements in each of those years. We could not break these figures down further without incurring disproportionate costs. The costs from 2002 to 2006 cover redundancy packages only.</p>

	<p pid="a.37WS.0/19">Since 1995, we have given FCO senior management staff the opportunity to volunteer for early retirement on CER or CES terms if they complete a full posting before retirement age or had been unable to find a suitable appointment within the Department. To meet efficiency targets, in particular to reduce substantially the number of staff in the Senior Management Structure, we extended this offer to a wider range of senior officers in September 2004, using funding from the HM Treasury' Efficiency Challenge Fund. The numbers of officers who took early retirement on these terms since 1997 are shown below. As mentioned previously, the costs for 1997 to 2001 are totals covering all early retirements; to provide a further break down would incur disproportionate costs.</p>
