<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-11-07a.34WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government" colnum="34WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/wmstext/61107m0001.htm#06110741000036">
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/1">Today I have published the outcome of the &quot;Review of Planning Enforcement&quot; that has been carried out by the Department for Communities and Local Government. There was a high level of response to the review&mdash;around 500 of those consulted sent in replies and recommendations to our questions about enforcement&mdash;whether it was working, and what might be done to improve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/2">There was strong agreement amongst consultees that the current statutory framework for enforcement remains fit for its purpose. There was no need to introduce stronger provisions, or to make unauthorised development a criminal offence, and enforcement should remain at the discretion of local authorities,</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/3">The introduction of temporary stop notices was an early outcome of the Review of Planning Enforcement. It is now over eighteen months since we gave local planning authorities the power to issue a temporary stop notice to require the immediate cessation of a breach of planning control for a period of 28 days. This has proved a popular enforcement tool for local planning authorities. Over 300 were used in 2005-06 to stop unauthorised development, protect the environment and to speed up the process of enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/4">Temporary stop notices have proven a welcome and helpful measure in speeding up the enforcement process. They have been used successfully to stop a wide variety of unauthorised development, including: damage to listed buildings, trees, wildlife sites; unauthorised landfill, quarrying, tipping, processing and storage of waste, clay extraction; building new houses, flats, garages, barns; Gypsy sites; access roads and engineering and building works.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/5">The review has, however, highlighted that enforcement does not have a high profile in authorities and that there is a lack of resources and trained staff working in this area. In taking forward the recommendations of the review, therefore, our focus is on how we can encourage and support proactive approaches to enforcement in planning. Enforcing planning activity, whether through reaction to complaints about breaches, proactive monitoring, or taking measures that prevent the necessity of repeated interventions, helps to create a quality, fully rounded planning service which in turn delivers sustainable outcomes. I want all authorities to regard enforcement as an essential element in their service.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/6">To that end, we are looking at working with the Planning Advisory Service and the National Association of Planning Enforcement to provide opportunities and events that promote the importance of enforcement and provide workshops and training around some of the key elements. We will be encouraging authorities to share ideas at these events, with the aim of producing a benchmark of good practice, and some 'golden rules' of enforcement. And we are working, through our culture change programme, on identifying training and career structures for staff working in enforcement, and raising its profile in authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/7">We have also accepted recommendations in the review to look at some longer term changes. Over the next year we will be updating Circular 10/97 and the Enforcement Good Practice Guide.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/8">There are also some areas where we will commission further work, following helpful comments from those we consulted. In particular, we will work with the LGA to see whether there is scope for extending planning fees to cover aspects of enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/9">Publication of this review is only the first step in an ongoing process of evaluation and change that is designed to ensure that authorities have the means at their disposal to carry out effective and appropriate enforcement, and maintain the integrity of their planning functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/10">A summary of the recommendations has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.36WS.2/1">I am publishing today the Government's response to the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee report, of <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August</phrase>, on &quot;Reform of the Coroners' System and Death Certification&quot;. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It will also be made available on the Department for Constitutional Affairs website.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/2">The draft Coroners Bill was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June</phrase>. In the Bill we aim to do three things. First we will improve the way that the system serves the public interest and meet bereaved families' concerns. The Bill will give families involved in the inquest process a clear legal standing in the system. We will also give families new rights through a new complaints and appeals system, enabling them to challenge a coroners' decision, and the introduction of a Charter for Bereaved People which lays out the level of service families can expect. Secondly we will strengthen coroners' work. The Bill will establish a proper appointments system for coroners, who will have to be legally qualified and will have to work full time as coroners, instead of having another job and working part time as coroners. Thirdly, we will create a national structure for coroners' work. For the first time there will be a chief coroner who will provide national leadership for coroners, as the Lord Chief Justice does for judges. This will be supported by national standards, a coronial advisory council, a proper inspection system and national training for coroners and their officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/3">I would like to thank the Committee for its thorough inquiry into our proposals to reform the coroners system, as set out in the draft Coroners Bill and for the additional consideration it gave to death certification. The Government regard pre-legislative scrutiny as a vital step in the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/4">Our public consultation exercise on the Bill has almost concluded. We are considering very carefully the views put forward about our proposals before finalising the Bill for parliamentary introduction as soon as time allows.</p>

To meet efficiency targets, in particular to reduce substantially the number of staff in the Senior Management Structure, we extended this offer to a wider range of senior officers in September 2004, using funding from the HM Treasury' Efficiency Challenge Fund. The numbers of officers who took early retirement on these terms since 1997 are shown below.

	<p pid="a.38WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October 2006</phrase> in a written answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-10-18.1331W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1331W</phrase>, I stated that 187,086 tattoos were removed by the NHS between April 2004 and March 2005. I regret that this figure was incorrect.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/2">A variety of procedures are used to remove tattoos, which are also used in the treatment of other skin conditions. NHS information systems do not record sufficient detail to allow distinction between procedures to remove tattoos and procedures to treat other skin conditions. The answer was based on a mistaken attempt to estimate the number of tattoos from the information on the wider grouping of skin procedures. That attempt was intended to be helpful, but ended up being misleading because it is not possible from the existing data sets to say with any precision how many tattoos are removed by the NHS each year, and secondly, because clinical advice is that it is likely to be a far smaller number than the figure given.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/3">I have received a formal apology from the Information Centre, who accept full responsibility for providing an incorrect response to the parliamentary question.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/4">The Information Centre and the Department of Health place the highest importance on the integrity of information and I have been assured by the chief executive of the Information Centre and the permanent secretary at the Department of Health that appropriate steps are being taken to ensure that a similar situation does not recur.</p>

	Highly Skilled Migrant Programme
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-11-07a.39WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" speakeroffice="The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality" colnum="39WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/wmstext/61107m0002.htm#06110741000141">
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/1">I am today announcing changes which the Home Office is making to the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/2">We believe that properly managed migration is in the interests of the UK and that we should aim to attract the brightest and the best from around the globe. The Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP), which was launched in 2002, has played a crucial role in ensuring that we do this. It allows individuals with exceptional skills to come to the United Kingdom to seek work or opportunities for self-employment. Highly skilled migrants contribute to the economy and help to create opportunities for UK workers. The UK has benefited from the contribution which they make and it is important that we continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/3">That is why we are making changes to the programme today, which will build on its past success to make it more effective in attracting the most highly skilled migrants to the UK. We will do this by introducing more objective and transparent criteria which lead to the award of points under the scheme. Some of the current points scoring criteria are subjective, and so are difficult for prospective applicants to measure themselves against and for caseworkers to judge. We are replacing them with a set of more objective attributes, which will award points for previous academic and professional qualifications, previous earnings, and age, as well as bonus points for previous work (or study, in some cases) in the UK. Holders of MBA degrees from certain institutions will still be able to receive all of the points necessary to be approved, for having that qualification. We are also introducing a mandatory English language requirement, outside the points structure, for both initial and extension applications under HSMP. It is right that those who come to work in highly skilled jobs should be able to speak English, which is integral to labour market success.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/4">We are also making a change to the requirements for those who have already been granted leave under HSMP and who apply to extend it. The current extension test is that applicants should have taken all reasonable steps to become lawfully economically active in the UK. We are replacing this with a points test and a mandatory English language requirement, similar to those faced by applicants applying to the programme for the first time. These tests will make it easier to curtail abuse within the scheme and will ensure that applicants who are granted further leave under the HSMP have demonstrated their ability to make a contribution to our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/5">I am also announcing new rules relating to the verification of documents submitted in HSMP applications. This will give entry clearance officers and caseworkers three key new powers:</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/6" class="indent">We will specify the documents which applicants are required to provide as evidence of their points claims and of their English language ability. This is to ensure that we are able to verify documents independently, and will help to discourage abusive applications. It will also make the application process easier for 'bona fide' applicants, maintaining the UK's competitive advantage as a destination for high achievers.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/7" class="indent">We will now refuse applications outright when documents which are not genuine have been submitted, whether or not they are material to the application. Such applicants should not be able to qualify under the scheme and are unlikely to benefit the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/8" class="indent">We will also be able to refuse cases where we have reasonable grounds to suspect that documents are not genuine, which remain after we have applied verification checks.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/9">These policies will not disadvantage genuine applicants, but will help to ensure that the scheme is both robust against abuse and targeted towards those who will benefit the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/10">We will make sure that the amended programme is kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/11">As of tomorrow, the current HSMP rules will be deleted and the programme will then be suspended for 27 days. We are taking these steps to avoid a rush of speculative applications by people who would wish their applications to be considered under the old rules, which is what happened after the publication of the Command Paper on the points-based system. The suspension will enable us to make the transition effectively to the new rules and ensure that current levels of customer service are maintained when the new arrangements are introduced. In the interests of good customer service, we have made sure that this will not disadvantage applicants substantively. Applications made for leave to remain under HSMP during the suspension period will not be returned; they will be accepted as valid and will be considered against the new rules after the suspension period. This means that nobody's leave will expire because of the suspension, provided that they make in-time applications. Migrants in this situation will also be given the chance to submit new evidence to show that they meet the new rules. Guidance on the new arrangements will be published tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/12">We also recognise that there will be people who are currently working or self-employed in the UK, but who may not be able to meet the new test for extending their leave. Many of these people will have been of real benefit to the UK, and we do not want to lose their contribution. We are therefore introducing specific transitional arrangements for people who have been self-employed or working as an independent contractor, but who will not be able to extend their leave under the new test. For people who have been employed, but cannot extend their leave under HSMP, we will make it easier for them to switch into work permit employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/13">These changes are good for applicants, because they will make the application process easier, clearer and more objective. They are good for the UK, because they will keep us competitive in attracting skilled workers who will be successful in the labour market. And they are good for employers, who will be more able to recruit highly skilled migrants. They will therefore bring HSMP closer in line with the Government's aims for migration, including supporting an objective set by the IND Review to 'boost Britain's economy by bringing the right skills here from around the world'. These changes will ensure that the HSMP remains one of our flagship immigration schemes. And I am confident that they will help us to maintain public confidence in our immigration system, and to make the case for managed migration where it is in the interests of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/14">A Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules, and Amendments to the Immigration (Leave to Remain) (Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2006, are being laid before Parliament today to give effect to these changes.</p>
