	<p>I have today set the following key performance indicators for the Valuation Office Agency for 2005&ndash;06:</p>
	<p>1. <i>Valuation Accuracy</i></p>
	<p class="indent">a. 2000 Local Rating List</p>
	<p class="indent">Confirm that reductions in the lists are kept to a maximum of 4.7 per cent. of the total compiled list rateable value over the entire life of the lists.</p>

	<p>4. <i>Value for money <sup>1</sup> </i></p>
	<p class="indent">Improve productivity by 5 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06 and be on course to achieve improvements of at least 15 per cent. over the four years from 2004&ndash;05 to 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p class="indent"><sup>2</sup> During 2005&ndash;06 this measure will be broadened to cover all the main areas in which we have direct contact with the citizen, whether as ratepayers or council taxpayers. The indicator will be re-based following the 2005&ndash;06 results.</p>

	<p>I am announcing today the publication of the Green Paper &quot;Independence, Well-being and Choice: Our Vision for the Future of Social Care for Adults in England&quot; (Cm 6499).</p>
	<p>This is an important part of our modernisation programme for public services and will set the social care agenda for the next decade. Formal consultation will enable us to develop firm proposals which will transform the lives of people who use social care by giving them more control and more choice in helping them to decide how their needs can best be met.</p>
	<p>These ambitions are based on what people who use services told us they would like to see. Turning this shared vision into reality will mean that social care services will have to be redesigned to give people more control over their assessments and how the money is spent. But this is not just about social care services. We want to see the capacity of the whole community harnessed to make sure that people have access to the full range of universal services to secure the best possible outcomes for all adults.</p>
	<p>The key proposals in the paper include the wider use of direct payments and the piloting of individual budgets to stimulate the development of modern services delivered in a way that people want; a strong strategic and leadership role for local government; closer working between health and social care sectors and greater involvement for the community and voluntary sector; plans to stimulate care capacity and informal caring; and encouraging the use of new models of service delivery including assistive technology and extra care housing, and a greater focus on preventative services.</p>
	<p>The ideas that we have put forward are designed to encourage and stimulate discussion about the future direction for adult social care. We would expect to develop concrete proposals for implementation following the formal consultation.</p>
	<p>The consultation will run until 28 July 2005 and will apply to England only. Copies of &quot;Independence, Well-being and Choice&quot; have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are also available from my Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/socialcare">www.dh.gov.uk/socialcare</a></p>

	<p>The Government have been working with Transport for London (TfL) and the Greater London Authority (GLA) to set out projections of the impact of TfL's business plan on the Department for Transport (DfT) national priorities, in order to generate overall agreed TfL planned outcomes.</p>
	<p>These projections are in the format of 2010 outcomes which are given in the table below. The table also includes the year end position for 2005&ndash;06 which is consistent with the planned 2010 result.</p>
	<p>These have been agreed at a working level between TfL, GLA and DfT, which I have discussed with the Mayor. They will be considered by the TfL Board on the 23 March, and are being published today alongside the TfL board papers. These outcomes are based on modelling, and as such will be updated as actual data is received.</p>
