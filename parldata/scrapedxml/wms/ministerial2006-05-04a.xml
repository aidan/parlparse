<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-05-04a.64WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" speakeroffice="The Minister for Trade" colnum="64WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060504/wmstext/60504m01.htm#60504m01.html_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/1">I commend the tireless efforts of the African Union (AU) mediation in Abuja to reach a peace deal for Darfur, and welcome their tabling, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April</phrase>, of compromise proposals for a Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA). My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has been at the Abuja talks since <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-02">2 May</phrase>. He is supporting the AU in its efforts to get the parties to agree a deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/2">I welcome the fact that the Government of Sudan are willing to sign the DPA. But I was extremely disappointed to hear that the rebel movements have rejected the first draft. They must realise that no deal will meet their full requirements; but this agreement is a fair and just one. It offers them participation in government and a political platform from which they can influence Darfur's future. I agree with the AU chief mediator's assessment that any future negotiations are likely to be less favourable to the movements.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/3">The pressure is now on the rebel movements to agree the deal. The international community will not understand if they fail to take this opportunity to bring peace to Darfur and security to its people. We have already made clear that those who impede the peace process will face sanctions under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1591. The rebel movements need to understand that this is their opportunity for a just settlement and such an opportunity is unlikely to recur.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/4">Darfur now stands at a critical juncture. Its people have suffered for far too long and it rests on the parties to the Abuja talks to give them the opportunity to rebuild their lives.</p>
