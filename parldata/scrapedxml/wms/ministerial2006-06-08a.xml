<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-08a.33WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning" colnum="33WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060608/wmstext/60608m0068.htm#06060864000023">
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-09">9 February</phrase> my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy informed the Standing Committee of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill that I would undertake an urgent review of local plans to determine whether there is a problem with emerging plans that do not fully incorporate PPS22 guidance. That review has now been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/2">The review has shown that in emerging new style regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks there has been a strong take-up of the policy in PPS22 on the use of on-site renewables in new developments. For those authorities preparing new plans where an appropriate stage in plan making has been reached, 26 out of 29 surveyed have devised policies to secure on-site renewables in new developments. The majority of them have set a requirement for 10 per cent. on-site renewables, where it is viable. Many of those at an earlier stage of developing their local development frameworks have not yet included PPS 22 policies, although they still have time to do so. We strongly encourage them to do so. For those areas still completing old style plans, such as unitary development plans, policies on on-site renewables are less likely to have been included.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/3">It is essential that all planning authorities follow this example and take account fully of the positive approach to renewables set out in PPS22 at the earliest opportunity in their plan-making. In particular the Government expect all planning authorities to include policies in their development plans that require a percentage of the energy in new developments to come from on-site renewables, where it is viable. Such policies have a vital role to play in reducing emissions, through the use of carbon-neutral energy sources. Local authorities who are now updating their plans through new local development frameworks should take the opportunity to update their policies in this area. The Government's forthcoming draft planning policy statement on climate change will be an opportunity to consider further how the planning process more generally can help combat climate change by extending the contribution of renewables from both on-site and off-site sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/4">A more detailed breakdown of plans that were examined for this review of PPS22 policies has been published today on the DCLG website at: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1500549">http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1500549</a> and is available in the Libraries of both Houses. I have instructed my officials to write to all chief planning officers enclosing a copy of this ministerial statement and to draw attention to the importance that the Government attach to such measures in tackling climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.34WS.2/1">The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to objects they loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the object loaned. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects, or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/2">The limit on the contingent liabilities which may be incurred in relation to the Government Indemnity Scheme for non-national museums and galleries in England approved by the Treasury in May 2004 was &pound;1.2 billion. As a result of two major temporary exhibitions taking place in non-national museums and galleries and the high value of the objects included in those exhibitions, it has been necessary to temporarily increase the limit to &pound;1.74 billion, effective from June 2006 until July 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.35WS.2/1">I represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-22">22 May 2006</phrase>. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Ben Bradshaw, represented the UK for the fisheries item.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/2">The Council held a policy debate on a proposal on organic farming, which aims to simplify and improve the structure of current regulations. All member states welcomed the proposal but could not agree on a number of points: the proposal to include mass catering and the obligation to use the EU logo or an EU organic indication. The Presidency noted the discussion and informed Council that two further working groups would now be held and that work on a compromise text would continue under the Finnish Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/3">Sweden, formally supported by the Czech Republic and the UK, urged the Commission to relax import restrictions on olive oil to reduce recent high EU price rises caused by a drop in supply. The Commission noted that production in 2005 had been exceptionally low due to drought in Spain and would continue to monitor the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/4">The Commission noted that in several member states farmers had missed the deadline for single farm payment applications due to technical difficulties. The Commission would consider a derogation for these cases to avoid penalising farmers. A UK request is under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/5">The Council adopted conclusions on the co-existence of genetically modified, conventional and organic crops.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/6">The Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner presented a progress report on the status of the veterinary agreement between the EC and the Russian Federation. Significant progress has been made and memoranda have been signed on regionalisation and intra-Community transit and fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/7">Under any other business, the Council took note of a written update on Avian influenza H5N1 by the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/8">Over lunch, the Agriculture Commissioner urged the EU to press for a package in WTO agricultural negotiations. She said there would be no unilateral commitment by the EU but that failure to agree a package was not in the EU7s interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/9">The only fisheries item was the proposal for a European Fisheries Fund, on which the Council had hoped to reach political agreement. However, member states failed to reach agreement on a compromise and it is likely that this proposal will return to Council during the Finnish Presidency.</p>

	<p pid="a.37WS.1/1">In recognition of the increasing importance of the FCO network in delivering our climate change goals, I have looked again at our strategic international priorities, set out in the Government White Paper &quot;Active Diplomacy for a Changing World: the UK's International Priorities&quot;, published in March. Climate change was covered in the White Paper and implicit in strategic priorities five and six. I believe that we need to emphasise its central importance to our international agenda by creating a new Strategic Priority. This will be:</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Achieving climate security by promoting a faster transition to a sustainable, low carbon global economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/3">This wording is designed to draw attention to the outcome that the effort on climate change needs to achieve; and to underline the reality, which is not yet fully reflected in the priorities of foreign ministries worldwide, that climate change has become a core foreign policy challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/4">I am also announcing today the appointment of John Ashton as my Special Representative for Climate Change. His primary focus will be to build a stronger political foundation for international action on climate change, working to build consensus among key governmental and non-governmental actors in priority countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/5">DEFRA will continue to lead our internationalwork on climate change. But the new Strategic Priority and John Ashton's appointment will strengthen significantly the contribution the FCO can make.</p>

	<p pid="a.39WS.2/1">I am today announcing the publication of consultation documents for the new East Midlands, West Midlands and cross-country rail franchises. Copies of the consultation documents have been placed in the House Library and are availableon the Department for Transport website at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced that three new rail franchises would be created (East Midlands, West Midlands and a new cross-country) from four currently existing franchises (Central, Silverlink, Cross-Country and Midland mainline). The new franchises will begin operation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-11">Sunday 11 November 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/3">The publication of the three documents begins the formal consultation process on the service levels the new train operators should provide. The documents are a consultation on the franchise specifications and seek views on the minimum service level the Department for Transport (DfT) will wish to procure. This consultation and the responses received will later inform the Invitation to Tender (ITT) that bidders for each franchise will be asked to bid against this autumn. Bidders will have to provide the minimum service levels the ITT sets out and will be able to propose additional services above this minimum subject to any operational constraints and affordability.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/4">Our aim is to ensure that all three franchises build on the recent success of current operators. Passenger numbers on Britain's railway are growing, particularly on key routes served by these new franchises. We want to see those numbers continue to grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/5">These new franchises are expected to meet current and future passenger demand and deliver a 2-5 per cent. increase in the number of trains operated per day. Bidders will also be required to build on recent performance improvements, and deliver value for money for both fare and taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/6">The documents propose service levels that will address crowding, allow for future growth and will put faster services in place on key routes. Passenger capacity will increase. On the cross-country franchise, DfT is proposing a timetable structure that allows bidders to put forward a substantial increase in capacity on key crowded trains. The department expects bidders to propose additional carriages and longer trains on busy routes. Overall, the cross-country network is expanding with extra stations served. In particular, the consultation documents propose service levels that further capitalise on the &pound;7.6 billion investment on the West Coast main line.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/7">This is an important consultation that covers the provision of over 2,000 daily rail services. The consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-07">7 August 2006</phrase>. Over the coming weeks the Department will be having extensive discussions with local interested stakeholders. It is important to ensure that these new franchises deliver further improvements for current and future rail passengers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-08a.42WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" speakername="Anne McGuire" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions" colnum="42WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060608/wmstext/60608m0069.htm#06060864000124">
	<p pid="a.42WS.2/1">I havetoday laid a draft code of practice prepared by the Disability Rights Commission (DRC), before Parliament in accordance with the procedure set out in section 53A(4) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. This draft code will replace the existing code of practice on &quot;Rights of Access: Goods, Facilities, Services and Premises&quot;, published in May 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.42WS.2/2">During the passage of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 2005, the Government said that the DRC would be issuing guidance to assist in the implementation of the new duties. The Government believe that clear and accessible advice and guidance for those with rights and responsibilities under the DDA is important. The Government therefore warmly welcome the draft revised code which provides clear advice and guidance for those with obligations under part 3 of the Act on how to avoid acts of disability discrimination, and to landlords and tenants on how to deal with requests by tenants for consent to make disability-related alterations to their homes to improve access for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.42WS.2/3">The draft revised code takes account of new duties in part 3 and part 5B of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, inserted by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005; and new duties introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006. The new duties mainly come into force from<phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>. They affect public authorities in the carrying out of their functions (other than those functions which are services and already covered by the DDA); private members clubs; and landlords and managers of rented premises in relation to reasonable adjustments and disability-related alterations to let residential premises. In preparing this code the DRC has consulted extensively among disabled people, their organisations, landlords and the wider public.</p>
	<p pid="a.42WS.2/4">Subject to Parliament's approval of the draft code, the DRC proposes to issue and publish the revised code later this summer, giving those with responsibilities under the Act adequate time to read it before the new duties come into force. The Secretary of State willthen provide for the new code to come into force on<phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>, replacing the existing code fromthat date.</p>
