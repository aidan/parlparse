<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-17a.116WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" speakeroffice="The Minister for Energy" colnum="116WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060317/wmstext/60317m02.htm#60317m02.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.116WS.2/1">I represented the UK at the extraordinary Energy Council meeting in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March</phrase>. Discussion focused largely on the recent Commission Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.2/2">Commissioner Piebalgs described the Green Paper as a comprehensive and balanced response to the Hampton Court agenda. The Commission envisaged a six-month consultation period before taking a view on any additional measures, although some actions could be taken more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.2/3">For the UK, I recognised the scale of the challenge and need for prompt action. I emphasised the priority of completing the internal energy market, promoting both transparency and regulatory consistency, and supporting the DG Competition sectoral inquiry. Externally, I underlined the need for a coherent strategy to engage key providers, transit countries and consumers, but particularly Russia and neighbouring countries. I also advocated an ambitious but realistic approach to promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. I drew attention to the UK paper identifying priority actions that the spring European Council might endorse.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.2/4">Other member states indicated broad support for the Commission's analysis, agenda and level of ambition. They welcomed the focus on open and competitive markets, though one warned against further legislation now, while another questioned how competitive markets could be consistent with ensuring energy security. Other issues to attract comment were support for energy efficiency, a long-term renewables strategy, developing interconnections, and new external initiatives with Russia and EuroMed countries. Many member states emphasised national sovereignty over energy mix. One explicitly supported the UK paper while others touched on many of the actions proposed there.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.2/5">Commissioner Kroes warned that the Commission would act against mergers or acquisitions that were anti-competitive, but noted that cross-border activity in this area was often a positive sign of the operation of an open and competitive market.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.2/6">The presidency concluded that the Energy Council would return to the Green Paper in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.2/7">The Council adopted conclusions on energy Ministers' contribution to the 2006 spring European Council. Council also approved the final text of the energy efficiency directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.2/8">In two other brief items, the Energy Council is expected to adopt its own conclusions in June on the Agriculture Council conclusions on the Biomass Action Plan; and Poland made a presentation of its idea for an energy security treaty outside the EU framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.118WS.2/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March</phrase> in Brussels. There were no health or consumer affairs issues. I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/2">The main items were preparation for the spring European Council and the Tripartite Social Summit through the endorsement of a set of key messages to the European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/3">The presidency posed three questions to help focus the discussion. The first question was to the Council asking if it shared the Commission's assessment on the delays of implementing delivery in certain unemployment policy areas. The second question was on the role of the social partners in strengthening the Lisbon process and the third question was on the progress made with social protection and social inclusion. I supported the key messages paper, particularly the focus on implementation and delivery. I stated that we all need to deliver the promises made to Europe's citizens in our national reform programmes and that we must step up a gear to deliver against Lisbon and contribute to the economic well being of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/4">The Council noted the annual Work Programmes of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/5">The Council reached general agreement on proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 (Miscellaneous amendments 2005). This is a regular update of the regulation which coordinates social security within the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/6">The final agenda item was a Commission presentation on the report on transitional arrangements set out in 2003 Accession Treaty. These are the measures allowing member states to restrict, for a transitional period, free movement of workers from eight of the new member states. As the UK has opened its labour market I outlined the benefits the UK labour market has drawn from this. Portugal, Spain and Finland announced that they would be lifting their restrictions from <phrase class="date" code="">1 May 2006</phrase>.</p>
