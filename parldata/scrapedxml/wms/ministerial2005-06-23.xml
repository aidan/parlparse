<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-23.47WS.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" speakeroffice="The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality" colnum="47WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050623/wmstext/50623m03.htm#50623m03.html_spmin2">
	<p pid=".47WS.3/1">I am today announcing the findings of the review of the Sectors-Based Scheme (SBS). The scheme, which currently has the status of a pilot, was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-01">1 May 2003</phrase> and provided for the issuance of work permits for low skilled vacancies in the hospitality and the food-processing sectors. The scheme is quota based. The current quotas for 2004&ndash;05 are 6,000 permits for food processing and 9,000 permits for hospitality. The main aims of the scheme were to alleviate the recruitment difficulties in the relevant sectors by providing employers with a means of recruiting workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/2">Following the decision to grant free movement of work to nationals of the new accession states and in light of the number of accession state nationals undertaking low-skilled work, we have undertaken a review of the SBS to establish whether there exists an ongoing need for it. In addition, the review has also assessed evidence of any immigration abuse in connection with the scheme. The aims of the review are in line with the Government's five-year immigration and asylum strategy, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February 2005</phrase>. This contained a commitment to phase out the current low-skilled schemes in light of the additional labour now available from the new EU accession states and after consultation with the sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/3">The findings of the review of the SBS are based upon an extensive consultation with the sectors, which has included an employer questionnaire, as well as meetings with employers, sector representative bodies, trade unions and available management information. The review has looked at each sector separately and the main findings are:</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/4" class="italic">Food Processing:</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/5">We have found that the SBS has operated satisfactorily in this sector and that there is a continuing need for the scheme. Employers have been able to use the scheme to meet labour shortages in those areas, particularly Northern Ireland, where tight labour markets and the unattractiveness of the work in question have resulted in a difficulty in recruiting resident labour. There is little evidence of abuse of the scheme in this sector. It does appear that workers admitted under the scheme to work in this sector have returned overseas after one year, with a view to participating again in the scheme, as was originally envisaged.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/6">While employers in this sector have indicated a willingness to recruit workers from Accession states they have pointed to a difficulty in retaining workers who are free to engage in other, more attractive employment. The consistent message from employers in this sector has been that if the SBS were discontinued, they would face acute difficulties in recruiting the workforce they require without significantly increasing their costs. The likely consequence of their doing so would be that they would face closure. As such the current pilot scheme will be extended for a further 12 months before undergoing a further evaluation. Based upon current usage the annual quota for 2005&ndash;06 will be set at least 3,500 permits, but we will consult further with employers to establish the precise figure.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/7" class="italic">Hospitality sector:</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/8">By contrast, the findings of the review do not point to a compelling case for continuing to operate such a scheme for the hospitality sector. The review points to evidence of abuse of the scheme and a high level of employment of Accession nationals in this sector.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/9">There is evidence of abuse of the scheme in relation to this sector. This includes numbers of entry clearance refusals on the basis of submission of fraudulent documentation or where, on examination, it is apparent that the individual does not meet the age criteria of the scheme. There is also evidence that third party representatives have submitted applications for SBS permits in respect of fictitious jobs or without the knowledge of the employer specified on the application form. There is, therefore, a concern that the scheme in this sector is being used as a means of facilitating illegal entry.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/10">In addition, many participants in this scheme have been unable to satisfy immigration criteria designed to test their credibility as temporary entrants. It is a criterion of the scheme that entry clearance may be refused to the holder of an SBS permit if the entry clearance officer is not satisfied that the holder will return overseas upon the expiry of his permit. Many SBS participants in the hospitality sector presenting themselves to the visa issuing authorities have been unable to satisfy this test and hence many of the workers the employers have sought to recruit under the hospitality quota have not been admitted.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/11">It is also apparent that the hospitality sector in general has been able to draw upon nationals of Accession states to meet labour shortages following expansion of the EU. The latest published figures for the worker registration scheme show that between <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, 42,070 Accession nationals registered to undertake employment in the hospitality sector. This represents 25.5 per cent. of the total number of registered workers and is to be contrasted with 8,665 permits issued under the SBS scheme. Retention of these workers appears to be less of an issue in this sector due to its preferred employment practices and the seasonal variance in demand of labour.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/12">In view of the above, the consequences of discontinuing the scheme in relation to the hospitality sector in general do not appear to be acute as employers do appear to be drawing upon alternative sources of labour, such as nationals of the new accession states. Any adverse consequences on discontinuing the scheme for this part of the sector are outweighed by the risk of continuing abuse of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.3/13">Accordingly, the SBS hospitality quota will be terminated. This does not mean that employers in this sector will immediately cease to have the benefit of non-EEA workers with the specific skills that they require. As a transitional measure, we will continue to issue SBS permits under the existing quota for the hospitality sector until <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-31">31 July</phrase> or until the current quota is exhausted, whichever is sooner. In addition, many of those admitted as the holder of a SBS permit issued under the current quota have permission to remain for several more months and may remain in employment here until they are due to leave. I should also emphasise that where employers in the hospitality sector require skilled workers from overseas, they may continue to apply for permits under the main work permit scheme.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-23.49WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="49WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050623/wmstext/50623m04.htm#50623m04.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".49WS.1/1">Section 21 of the Drugs Act 2005 will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase>. Section 21 has amended the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 so that any fungi containing psilocin or an ester of psilocin&mdash;commonly known as magic mushrooms&mdash;are controlled drugs. Psilocin is already a class A drug&mdash;fresh magic mushrooms will be class A too.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.1/2">Magic mushrooms are a powerful hallucinogen and can cause real harm, especially to vulnerable people and those with mental health problems. The law has not been clear with regard to the status of fresh magic mushrooms and some have tried to exploit this apparent loophole. In the last two years there has been a sudden increase in the amount of magic mushrooms imported into the UK&mdash;HM Revenue and Customs estimate the imports for 2004 to be between 8&ndash;16,000 kilograms. The Government have acted to close the loophole by making clear that it will not allow the open sale of fresh magic mushrooms. It is now an offence to import, export, produce, supply, possess or possess with intent to supply magic mushrooms whatever form they are in, whether prepared or fresh. This is a clarification of the law not a reclassification. These measures received cross party support during the passage of the Drugs Bill through Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.1/3">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs agreed that the law on magic mushrooms would benefit from clarification. Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, Chair of the Council, wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-02">2 June</phrase> stating that &quot;Council members accepted entirely that there should not be easy access to hallucinogenic mushrooms&quot; and &quot;this was a sensible move to clarify the law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.1/4">During the Commons Committee stage of the Drugs Bill, the Government undertook to bring in regulations dealing with exceptions from the offence of possession in certain circumstances. The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2005 are being laid before Parliament today and are due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase>. The regulations amend the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 to provide exceptions from the offence of possession of magic mushrooms. For example, a person will not be committing an offence of possession of magic mushrooms if the mushrooms are growing naturally and uncultivated on their premises.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.1/5">Also to be laid at the same time is the Misuse of Drugs (Designation) (Amendment) Order 2005. The Order is due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase> and confirms legally that magic mushrooms, like psilocin, are designated as having no recognised medicinal use.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.1/6">Known suppliers and importers of magic mushrooms will be notified formally of the legal change as a precursor to commencement of the provisions on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.1/7">Copies of the Regulations and the Order will be placed in the Library. Other sections of the Drugs Act 2005 will come into force later in the year.</p>
