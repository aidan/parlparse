	<p pid="a.131WS.8/1">In December 2002, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced a review of security vetting arrangements in Northern Ireland, with the aim of ensuring that these were effective; proportionate; compliant with human rights and other statutory requirements; and in line with UK-wide best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.8/2">The review, which has involved representatives from Government Departments, the police and security agencies, and Government legal services, has now completed its detailed work. I have accepted its recommendations, which have improved security vetting procedures through the following significant changes:</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.8/3" class="indent">a range of enhancements to protective security in the areas of personnel, physical and IT security;</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.8/4" class="indent">an increased focus on risks and improved safeguards in vulnerable areas, enabling a major reduction in the number of posts requiring vetting on grounds of national security across government while improving, through better use of resources, the protective security of key areas; and</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.8/5" class="indent">the introduction, now underway, of internal appeal processes for existing employees against the refusal or withdrawal of national security vetting clearances, to provide better transparency and fairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.8/6">I believe that these are positive steps which will both promote confidence in the equality of opportunity afforded by Government employment, and improve the protections for and integrity of important Government activities and public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.8/7">The Government attach particular importance to addressing all aspects of protective security. Work to drive the changes forward will continue. It is essential that in Northern Ireland, as in the UK as a whole, sound protective security regimes are in place to protect vulnerable and critically important public functions and activities from the whole range of threats, including domestic and international terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="a.133WS.6/1">I am pleased to announce the ministerial targets for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency for 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/2">The Ministerial Targets are:</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/3" class="indent">1. In at least 96 per cent. of incidents, within five minutes of being alerted, take a decision on the appropriate search and rescue response and initiate action if necessary;</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/4" class="indent">Deliver at least 97 per cent. of planned ship inspections;</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/5" class="indent">Carry out 95 per cent. of mandatory expanded ship inspections.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/6" class="indent">2. Ensure, by working with UK shipowners, that no more than 3 per cent. per cent. of UK ships inspected under the Paris memorandum of understanding (MOU) arrangements are detained, and also ensure that the UK shipping register maintains a position on the Paris MOU white list which is comparable to registers of a similar size and reputation.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/7" class="indent">3. Reduce the proportion of people who suffer death or injury while involved in beach activities, coastal swimming and recreational diving, by increasing MCA prevention activities, working in partnership with other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/8" class="indent">4. From a baseline of 76 per cent., increase customer satisfaction with seafarer documentation services to at least 80 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/9" class="indent">5. Establish a fully operational automatic identification system (AIS) network around the UK coast, to implement real-time tracking and monitoring of shipping movements from the shore. This will ensure the UK meets its obligations under the vessel traffic monitoring directive, and will assist monitoring of SOLAS convention traffic in transit through UK coastal waters, providing real time situational awareness to all rescue co-ordination centres within their operational area for the first time. This will enhance capability for SAR co-ordination activity, Marine pollution control co-ordination, monitoring of voluntary (MAREP) reporting schemes and vessels in transit through traffic separation schemes around the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/10" class="italic">Development Targets:</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/11"><i>Prevention</i>&mdash;in addition to Target 3 above</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/12" class="indent">6. In 2006&ndash;07, reduce the proportion of machinery failures on commercial ships and leisure craft in the UK, by increasing prevention activities, working with other relevant organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.6/13" class="indent">In 2007&ndash;08 review the implementation, effectiveness and impact of the comprehensive prevention strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.134WS.2/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Gravesham borough council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.134WS.2/2">In 2003&ndash;04, Gravesham borough council administered some &pound;21 million in housing benefits, about 41 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. Between April 2001 and March 2004 the council raised only two administrative penalties and no formal cautions or prosecutions had been made. Weaknesses in counter-fraud work included a lack of up-to-date policies and procedures, limited awareness of benefit fraud as an issue and ineffective work with Jobcentre Plus and the Pension Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.134WS.2/3">However, some progress had been made since the appointment of a benefits manager and a fraud and inspections manager, including the completion of 48 investigations, with three sanctions administered and the recruitment of four staff to carry out reviews of postal claims and home visits from October 2004. There are also plans to recruit two more fraud investigators.</p>
	<p pid="a.134WS.2/4">The performance development team is now working with the council to help develop a long-term performance improvement strategy for the counter-fraud unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.134WS.2/5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFPs findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.135WS.1/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Hinckley and Bosworth borough council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.1/2">In 2003&ndash;04 Hinckley and Bosworth borough council administered some &pound;10 million in housing benefits, about 35 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. BFI's comprehensive performance assessment in April 2004 found weaknesses in the council's counter-fraud activity. The inspection found that since then the situation has improved and the counter-fraud service is now performing to a reasonable standard. It is clear that the council is now committed to improving its counter-fraud service and this was shown by the prompt and positive reaction from members, senior managers and staff to BFI's findings and recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.1/3">There is now a comprehensive set of policies and procedures to guide staff and investigators are experienced and generally well trained, although did not fully comply with legislation and guidance in some investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.1/4">Senior managers and members need to ensure that internal and external auditors support their efforts to ensure that the benefits system is safe and secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.1/5">In September 2004, the council made a successful bid for performance standards funding to provide training and support officer and was keen to explore further funding for other counter-fraud initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.1/6">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.135WS.3/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on South Buckinghamshire district council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.3/2">In 2003&ndash;04, South Buckinghamshire district council administered some &pound;9 million in housing benefits, about 38 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. BFI found that the council's counter-fraud work and audit arrangements were not at standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.3/3">The council had contracted out counter-fraud work in 1997 but little meaningful counter-fraud work was done under these arrangements. Following a best value review of the revenues and benefits service, direct responsibility for managing counter-fraud was returned to the council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-01">1 September 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.3/4">BFI found that existing strategic and policy plans contained too little detail to be fully effective and that some were still in draft. In many cases no fraud file was set up to hold details of the investigation and where a fraud file did exist it contained insufficient information. The management of the council's counter-fraud resources and quality of the investigative work was poor. No fraud sanctions had been applied in over 10 years. The performance development team is now working with the council to develop a long-term strategy to improve counter-fraud work.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.3/5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.136WS.1/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Flintshire county council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.1/2">In 2003&ndash;04, Flintshire county council administered some &pound;26.5 million in housing benefits, about 10 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. In the final quarter of 2003&ndash;04 the council was taking 89 days on average to process new claims to housing benefits against the Standard of 36 days. This performance placed it in the bottom quartile of performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.1/3">BFI found that the council had bought a new benefits IT system in November 2003 but had some difficulty implementing it and this led to backlogs of work. The council had cleared these by June 2004 but in doing so training and the development of effective management information were neglected. By October 2004 Flintshire county council was processing new claims in 70 days, a useful improvement but still almost twice the standard time. Significant problems remain with the IT system and these must be addressed urgently. While the benefits service is integral to the council's corporate aims, objectives and targets for it were not prioritised, job descriptions did not reflect staff duties and lines of responsibility for benefits staff were not clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.1/4">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFPs findings.</p>
