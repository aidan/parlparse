<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-03-18a.56WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" speakeroffice="The Solicitor-General" colnum="56WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/wmstext/90318m0001.htm#09031892000061">
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Attorney-General has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Last year the Government published two consultation papers on measures to improve the effectiveness of fraud prosecutions. The first consultation paper, in relation to a proposed framework for plea negotiation between defence and prosecution in fraud cases, was published in April. The second, concerning proposals to strengthen the powers of the Crown Court to deal with fraud, was published in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/3" class="indent">The Government are today publishing a paper summarising the responses received in both these consultation exercises, and setting out how we will take these proposals forward. The measures form part of the &quot;National Fraud Strategy&quot; which is being published in full tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/4" class="indent">In general the responses that we received to the two consultations were positive, with many respondents agreeing in principle with the measures proposed. Many helpful suggestions were received as to their practical implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/5" class="indent">In relation to the plea negotiation framework, I am now issuing Attorney-General's guidelines to prosecutors to bring this into effect shortly. The guidelines set out a clear and transparent procedure for prosecutors to engage in discussions with defence legal representatives at an early stage in a fraud case with a view to narrowing the factual issues and, where possible, agreeing what charges the defendant will plead guilty to. This procedure is designed to help complex cases progress through the criminal justice system in a quicker and more efficient fashion, while protecting the interests of the public and victims of fraud, and respecting the rights of defendants.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/6" class="indent">In relation to the extended sentencing powers for the Crown Court, the Government intend to bring forward legislation extending the range of fraud victims who will be eligible for compensation, and strengthening the enforcement measures available to the courts to see that compensation orders are paid. Legislation is also planned to allow the Crown Court to bar convicted fraudsters from practising in certain key professions, and to wind up companies that have been used as vehicles for fraud. These measures should reduce the need for duplicated criminal, civil and regulatory proceedings, and also strengthen confidence in the ability of the courts to protect the public from fraud and compensate victims. This legislation will be introduced as soon as the Parliamentary programme allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/7" class="indent">The National Fraud Strategy, being published tomorrow, meets a key recommendation of the 2006 Fraud Review. Produced and co-ordinated by the National Fraud Strategic Authority, it will be implemented with partners across the business, public and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/8" class="indent">Copies of the paper &quot;The Introduction of a Plea Negotiation Framework for Fraud Cases in England and Wales and Extending the Powers of the Crown Court to Prevent Fraud and Compensate Victims: Summary of Responses to Consultation Papers&quot; have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies of the &quot;National Fraud Strategy&quot; will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses tomorrow.&quot;</p>
