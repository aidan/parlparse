	<p pid="b.42WS.1/1">The Government have recognised the serious global risks from climate change and have set in legislation a challenging target to reduce UK carbon emissions by 80 per cent. against 1990 levels by 2050. Emissions from the way we heat, cool and power buildings are important in achieving this target: 17 per cent. of UK emissions are from non-domestic buildings and 27 per cent. from homes. The scale of the challenge means that we need to find ways of reducing emissions from all types of building as part of the UK's transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/2">I am today reaffirming the Government's commitment to the ambition for all new non-domestic buildings to be zero carbon from 2019, and publishing a consultation document that sets out policy principles and options for meeting this ambition. I am also setting out our plans for how new public sector buildings could lead the way, building on the work of a cross-departmental task force of government officials. We are seeking views on these options and their implications for viability for individual developments and sectors. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-26">26 February 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/3">This follows my statement in July, when I confirmed the Government's policy that all new homes will be zero carbon from 2016 and announced further details on the definition and standards we will legislate for. One in three of Britain's homes in 2050 will be built between now and then. So today I am also providing an update on the definition and measurement of zero carbon homes, following the report of a specialist task group.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/4" class="italic">Zero carbon non-domestic buildings</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/5">In December 2008 we published a consultation on options to meet the definition of zero carbon, which included some initial thinking about what this could mean for non-domestic buildings. I am announcing today our more detailed proposals and the next steps needed to enable new commercial buildings to be zero carbon from 2019.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/6">We will adopt the broad framework for zero carbon that has been developed for homes, but adapted appropriately to reflect the differences in the non-domestic buildings market and the variation between non-domestic buildings. This means that, as supported by responses to the 2008 consultation, we will be using the threefold hierarchy of energy efficiency, followed by onsite or linked low and zero carbon technologies (&quot;carbon compliance&quot;), followed by primarily offsite &quot;allowable solutions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/7">The policy will also reflect the important differences in non-domestic buildings, including the much wider variation in building types, locations, and uses, which can impact on both potential solutions and costs. We are therefore proposing that new non-domestic buildings should improve through an approach with differentiated targets to reflect the different potential different buildings have for energy efficiency and for onsite levels of carbon abatement. The consultation seeks views on this approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/8">Non-domestic buildings often have greater potential for onsite renewables (for example, more roof space) and to play a central role in the viability of community heat or energy networks. We need to determine the extent to which we encourage use of these opportunities, and the consultation covers these questions. Onsite heat and energy generation will also be eligible for financial assistance under Government incentive schemes for small-scale renewable generation, providing future income streams.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/9">Any carbon not mitigated onsite will be dealt with through a range of good quality 'allowable solutions'. We are proposing that we will bring in some allowable solutions from 2016, alongside the approach for homes, and thus develop a single system for delivery and assurance. This early deployment could help to increase the volume and therefore viability of the allowable solutions market in its early years, and could increase the opportunities for non-domestic developments to contribute to community energy solutions. I have said that I will make a further announcement later about the allowable solutions that will be included.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/10">For non-domestic buildings, the variation in energy uses is considerably greater than for homes-reflecting the range of different uses for individual building types as well as the range of energy-intensity of different commercial activity. As a minimum, the zero carbon standard for non-domestic buildings will include 100 per cent. of energy uses currently covered by the Building Regulations (principally space heating, cooling and internal lighting). We are considering in addition a simplified way of accounting for ongoing energy use in the building (such as machinery, refrigeration, or computers), through requiring either 10 or 20 per cent. extra improvement on top of regulated energy. The consultation seeks views on this and its potential impact on market viability.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/11">The public sector can play a significant role in supporting market development of low and zero carbon buildings. We confirm our ambition from Budget 2008 that the public sector should aim to make the move to zero carbon for new non-domestic buildings by 2018, one year ahead of commercial buildings. The consultation sets out our proposals for a work programme to deliver this.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/12">I have placed a copy of the consultation document and the detailed impact assessment that accompanies it in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/13" class="italic">Zero carbon homes</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/14">I announced in July that I would set up a specialist task group to examine the energy efficiency metrics and standards that should be part of zero carbon homes, in order to realise our ambition for the highest practical energy efficiency level realisable in all dwelling types.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/15">Following an intensive period of analysis and wider involvement of industry, commercial and environmental bodies, the task group has now reported to me. I am grateful to the task group for their excellent work and am placing a copy of their report in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/16">The recommendations are for an energy standard that is measured as the amount of energy required to provide space heating and cooling. The proposed standard is 46 kilowatt-hours per square metre per year (kWh/m<sup>(2)</sup>/year) for semi-detached and detached homes and 39 kWh/m<sup>(2)</sup>/year for all other homes. The further details of what that means are set out in the task group's report.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/17">I am satisfied that the task group's recommendations strike the right balance between a high level of ambition and a standard that can be realised in practice by 2016. I therefore intend to use this standard within the definition of zero carbon homes. I will be using our forthcoming consultation on updating the Code for Sustainable Homes to check that there are no unintended consequences from this standard and to seek views on the energy efficiency standard to be adopted in 2013. By aligning our approach to energy efficiency and zero carbon within the Code, we will smooth the transition to zero carbon homes in 2016.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/18">The task group has made a number of additional recommendations for further research and modelling to support the proposed energy standard. I shall be taking these recommendations forward, in collaboration with the Zero Carbon Hub and other relevant research and industry bodies. One of the particular recommendations is that industry will need design guidance to support the standard. I recognise that industry will need such guidance and will work with industry to produce this.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/19">I can also announce that the Government-funded Technology Strategy Board is allocating &pound;3.2 million of funding to boost long-term research into how we design and build low carbon homes. The research will use new technologies and materials to provide valuable evidence for future standards and how to drive down energy bills. This funding is part of the Technology Strategy Board's &pound;50 million Low Impact Buildings Innovation Platform, which is being allocated to projects in the period to 2011. The money will be used by a consortium-including Barratt Developments, Crest Nicholson, Stewart-Milne, H + H Celcon, Oxford Brookes University and the Building Research Establishment-to build demonstration homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.1/20">These homes will be built without the use of on-site renewables so as to test just how far it is possible to go towards zero carbon through energy efficient fabric measures alone and the implications of doing so. Having designed and built the homes, they will be monitored to find out the energy savings that occupants realise in practice and to learn more about the occupants' experience of living in highly energy efficient homes. The lessons we learn from these homes will be valuable evidence to support the way that the zero carbon homes of the future are built.</p>

	<p pid="b.58WS.4/1">I am announcing today that, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-14">14 December 2009</phrase>, employers wishing to recruit a migrant under Tier 2 of the points-based system will first need to advertise to jobseekers in the UK for four weeks. This strengthens the current requirement to advertise jobs for two weeks, or one week for jobs over &pound;40,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.4/2">Since April this year, the resident labour market test (RLMT) has included a requirement to advertise skilled jobs in Jobcentre Plus, so that resident workers have a single source-their local job centre-to access all skilled vacancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.4/3">This change was proposed by the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) in their Tier 2 report which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-19">19 August</phrase>, a copy of which can be found in the House Library. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-07">7 September</phrase> the Home Secretary announced that the Government have accepted the recommendations put forward in the report in full.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.4/4">The Prime Minister announced, in his speech on immigration on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-12">12 November</phrase>, that the strengthening of the resident labour market test would be introduced quickly, to better support resident workers looking for skilled jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.4/5">The flexibility of the points-based system allows us to support UK workers and at the same time meet the recruitment needs of businesses and to support the economy. In making this change, we are using that flexibility to support businesses in two ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.4/6" class="indent">First, we will only apply this change to advertising campaigns that start on or after <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-14">14 December</phrase>. Businesses that have already run advertisements will not need to do so again to meet the new requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.4/7" class="indent">Secondly, while we will require all jobs to be advertised for four weeks before a migrant worker can be appointed, we will not require the four weeks to be continuous. This will mean that businesses will not need to advertise all their vacancies for four weeks on the off-chance that no suitable resident workers apply and they need to recruit a migrant worker. For example, we will allow businesses to advertise skilled jobs for two weeks initially. If a suitable resident worker applies, the business can appoint them straight away. However, if no suitable resident workers apply, the resident labour market must be tested for a further two weeks before they can appoint a migrant worker.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.4/8">The other changes to Tier 2 recommended by the MAC will be implemented in spring 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.61WS.2/1">I would like to update the House on the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka. Six months ago the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka created almost 280,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). I visited Sri Lanka in early October and advocated freedom of movement for the IDP population who continue to be held in closed camps. At the time of my visit, this population numbered almost 253,000 people. I would like to reiterate that meeting the humanitarian needs of the IDPs remains the most immediate priority for the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.2/2">I welcome the recent announcement by the Government of Sri Lanka of their intention that all IDPs will have total freedom of movement from <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December</phrase> in the camps in Sri Lanka. It will be important that humanitarian agencies have access to fully meet the needs of the IDPs who choose to remain in the camps until they can return to their homes or go to host families. Approximately 130,000 IDPs still remain in these camps. Conditions remain basic but have improved since the separate visits to Sri Lanka earlier this year by the Foreign Secretary, a cross-party group of MPs led by Des Browne as well as my own previous visits in April and October. The monsoon has now started and it is raining heavily. Many of the temporary shelters are deteriorating and there is a risk that flooding will occur. With freedom of movement then it would be much more acceptable for humanitarian agencies to be able to improve conditions in the camps and support any moves to make them genuine welfare villages.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.2/3">I also join with the UN to welcome the recent progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka over the last four weeks in returning the IDPs from the closed camps in Vavuniya to their home areas. As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November</phrase>, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that over 132,000 IDPs have now either returned to their home areas or have been released to institutions or host families elsewhere. The majority of those returning to their homes have been to Jaffna. Returns are now starting to other areas in the Vanni such as Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.2/4">However, I also have concerns. The pace of returns is increasingly limited by the challenge of ensuring that areas are free from land mines and unexploded ordnance. I am pleased that we are helping to meet this challenge by funding the work of two British demining NGOs-the HALO Trust and Mine Action Group-to help make areas safe again. A further concern is that not all returnees enjoy unrestricted freedom of movement outside of their immediate home areas. Moreover, in some areas where the IDPs have been able to return home, humanitarian access for agencies to assist them is still restricted. This is making it unnecessarily hard to meet the basic needs of returning IDPs. I urge the Government of Sri Lanka to co-operate fully with all concerned humanitarian agencies so that they can undertake their usual assistance and protection activities, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.2/5">DFID continues to support the relief effort to Sri Lanka as the situation on the ground allows. Since September 2008, we have committed &pound;12.5 million. Last week I approved a further &pound;1 million from this budget to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to support the safe and dignified return of IDPs to their home areas. This grant will help provide transport, emergency shelters, temporary health clinics, immediate access to high quality water and sanitation facilities and livelihoods support for the returning IDP population. It will also allow IOM to extend their existing IDP registration programme to all IDPs. This registration programme was originally supported by DFID in April and is an essential part of enabling returning IDPs to access basic services.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.2/6">We have always made it clear that the IDP camps should not be anything other than temporary in nature. During my recent visit, I confirmed that once the critical monsoon season is over DFID will only fund-life-saving emergency interventions in the existing closed camps. The focus of our funding will shift further towards early recovery activities in the area of demining, support to the returns process and livelihood recovery. Once again, I would like to reassure the House that all DFID funding is provided directly to neutral and impartial international agencies. Some &pound;2.87 million remains to be committed as the situation on the ground allows.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.2/7">Looking forward, we recognise the progress that the Government of Sri Lanka have made towards their own original target of returning 80 per cent. of the IDPs to their areas of origin by the end of the year. After 26 years of intermittent conflict, there remains an additional 214,000 long-term displaced people to consider who may now also wish to return to their home areas. It is important that the Government of Sri Lanka addresses the needs of all IDPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.2/8">Our other priority since the end of the conflict has been to urge the Government to make a concerted effort to secure lasting peace by working for genuine reconciliation between Sri Lanka's communities. Our view remains that this can only be achieved through a fully inclusive political settlement that addresses the legitimate grievance and aspirations of all communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.2/9">The British Government continue to engage fully with the Government of Sri Lanka as well as international and multilateral partners. The Foreign Secretary discussed these issues with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister when they last spoke on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-04">4 November</phrase>. Our High Commissioner to Sri Lanka regularly raises our concerns with senior members of the Sri Lankan Government. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Sir John Holmes, visited Sri Lanka on 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-19">19 November</phrase> and concluded that returns must be both voluntary and informed. He also welcomed the Government of Sri Lanka's assurance regarding their commitment to ensuring full freedom of movement for IDPs. I spoke to Sir John Holmes yesterday about the humanitarian situation going forwards and the international response, and reiterated the UK priority of freedom of movement for the IDP population. I also welcomed the progress that has been made to date by the Government of Sri Lanka in returning the IDPs from the camps to their homes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-24b.68WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" speakername="Jack Straw" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor" colnum="68WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091124/wmstext/91124m0011.htm#09112472000520">
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/1">I wish to make the following statement to the House regarding the commencement of party funding provisions of the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009. The Act received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-21">21 July 2009</phrase> and represents a significant step towards a system of party funding which is more transparent, better regulated and, most importantly, better able to win the confidence of the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/2">The following provision will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-25">25 November 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/3" class="indent">Section 21-Limitation of pre-candidacy election expenses for certain general elections. This provision introduces a new spending limit for candidates at certain general elections, to run from the date after 55 months of a Parliament have elapsed until the date an individual formally becomes a candidate (this is, in most cases, the date of dissolution of Parliament). Commencement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-25">25 November</phrase> means that, in the case of the present Parliament, the new spending limit will apply to election expenses incurred on or after <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-25">25 November</phrase> which are used on or after <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/4">The following provisions will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/5" class="indent">Section 12-Defence to charge of failing to return donation from impermissible donor. This provision seeks to add clarity to the existing position in the 2000 Act, namely, that if a party treasurer is charged with an offence of accepting an impermissible donation, the party or party treasurer will not be guilty if they can show that they took all reasonable steps to verify that the donor was a permissible donor, and having done so, believed that was the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/6" class="indent">Section 13-&quot;Reasonable excuse&quot; in relation to certain offences under the 2000 Act. This provision recasts certain offences in the 2000 Act (mainly relating to requirements imposed by that Act to report various matters to the Electoral Commission) so that they may be committed only if something is done or not done &quot;without reasonable excuse&quot;. The provision also removes existing defences to the offences in question, in consequence of this new qualification to the acts or omissions that may constitute an offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/7" class="indent">Section 14-Control of donations to members associations: responsible persons. These provisions require that members associations in receipt of a reportable permissible donation (a transaction in excess of &pound;7,500) or an impermissible recordable donation (above &pound;500), appoint a responsible person where they do not have a treasurer.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/8" class="indent">Section 15-Control of donations to holders of elective office-compliance officers. These provisions are intended to alleviate some of the burden of complying with reporting procedures by allowing (but not requiring) holders of elective office<sup>(1)</sup> to appoint a compliance officer to assist with the duties of reporting and verifying donations and loans. The provisions do not absolve an office holder who chooses to appoint such an officer of guilt for a failure to comply.</p>

For the purposes of Schedule 7A (reporting of loans) the list of relevant elective offices is the same, with the exception of independent Members of the Scottish Parliament and independent members of Scottish local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.68WS.1/11" class="indent">Section 17-Control of loans to holders of elective office-compliance officers. This provision achieves the same effect as section 15, in relation to loans and related transactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/12" class="indent">Section 18-Person may not be &quot;responsible person&quot; for more than one recognised third party. A recognised third party is an organisation that spends more than &pound;10,000 on campaigning at an election and registers with the Electoral Commission as a result. This Section provides that persons responsible for ensuring compliance with the reporting requirements for expenditure to which recognised third parties are subject, as set out in the 2000 Act, may not discharge these responsibilities with respect to more than one recognised third party.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/13" class="indent">Section 20-Increased thresholds in relation to donations etc.. This Section increases to more than &pound;500 the threshold above which donations received and loans entered into must be recorded under the 2000 Act. Additionally the thresholds above which donations and loans must be reported to the Electoral Commission are increased to more than &pound;1,500 (for individuals and accounting units) and to more than &pound;7,500 (for registered parties, members associations, recognised third parties and permitted participants).</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/14">We are committed to implementing the Act in a timely and appropriate manner, taking account of good regulatory practice and the desirability of early commencement. We have been engaging with the political parties, the Electoral Commission and other Government Departments to ensure that the commencement programme for the Act is timely and effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/15">Subject to approval by both Houses where necessary, the following provisions will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-01">1 July</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/16" class="indent">Section 1(2)-Compliance with controls imposed by the 2000 Act etc. This provision amends Section 145 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 by clarifying that the function of the Electoral Commission is to regulate, as well as monitor, compliance with that Act. In its capacity as regulator, the Commission shall take such steps as they consider appropriate to secure compliance with those requirements. The Commission will publish guidance as to what conduct will satisfy the requirements of the 2000 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/17" class="indent">Section 2 (and Schedule 1)-Investigatory powers of the Commission. These provisions give effect to new Schedule 19B to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 which provides the Commission with powers to enable them to require access to information for certain purposes and to fulfil their function as an effective regulator.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/18" class="indent">Section 3 (and Schedule 2)-Civil Sanctions. These provisions insert new Schedule 19C to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. They give the Electoral Commission new powers to apply a range of civil sanctions to offences and contraventions under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (as amended by the Political Parties and Elections Act and the Electoral Administration Act 2006). The new flexible civil sanctions provide alternatives to referral for criminal prosecution under the 2000 Act, allowing the Electoral Commission to apply sanctions that are appropriate to the nature of each contravention. The Commission will also be able to use new approaches to secure compliance with the law where appropriate, rather than imposing a traditional penalty such as a fine, or referring a case for criminal investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/19" class="indent">Section 8-Education about systems of government and EU institutions. This provision restricts the Electoral Commission's educational role to promoting awareness of current and pending electoral systems in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/20">The following provisions will not be commenced before the summer of 2010:</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/21" class="indent">Section 9-Declaration as to source of donation;</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/22" class="indent">Section 10-Non-resident donors;</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/23" class="indent">Section 11-Non-resident lenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.68WS.1/24">Officials have begun preliminary work on the prerequisites to implementation of these provisions. However, as stated during consideration of Lords Amendments to the Bill, we are practically unable to commence Sections 10 and 11 before the summer of 2010 due to their complex nature. Section 9, which requires donors to provide declarations as to the true origins of all donations of over &pound;7,500, will be commenced alongside Sections 10 and 11 to ensure consistency in approach, which will be welcomed by those who make political donations, as well as parties and other recipients who will have to ensure that they comply with the additional declaration requirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.75WS.4/17" class="italic">Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit</p>
	<p pid="b.75WS.4/18">The change in the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit arises from a token increase to the administration forecast, where a Department's expenditure within the Estimate is wholly offset by income, so that a token amount of &pound;1,000 is voted.</p>
	<p pid="b.75WS.4/19" class="italic">Capital Departmental Expenditure Limit</p>
	<p pid="b.75WS.4/20">The decrease in the capital DEL reflects the Government Equalities Office surrender of capital funds. These were of little value to either the Government Equalities Office or the Commission for Equality and Human Rights and could be better used elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.75WS.4/21" class="italic">Administration Costs Limit</p>
	<p pid="b.75WS.4/22">This switch reflects the fact that GEO was established as a separate Department at a very late stage in CSR 07, and its budget did not reflect the costs of its stand-alone status. Successive changes have been made since then to ensure GEO has the right breakdown of money. This completes that process.</p>
