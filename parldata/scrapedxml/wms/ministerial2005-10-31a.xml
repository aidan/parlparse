<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-10-31a.22WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" speakername="Margaret Beckett" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="22WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051031/wmstext/51031m01.htm#51031m01.html_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/1">I attended and chaired the meeting of the Environment Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-17">17 October 2005</phrase>. I was accompanied by the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, Elliot Morley, in the UK seat.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/2">The agenda consisted of three substantive items: policy debates on the REACH chemicals legislation and on better regulation, and agreement of conclusions on climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/3">On the REACH chemicals dossier, Ministers were invited to comment on a compromise text prepared by the UK Presidency. There was widespread support for the balance struck in the text between achieving a high level of protection for human health and the environment, and limiting the impacts on industry, and several Ministers stressed their view that this balance should not be changed in the final compromise. Environment Ministers, and also the Commission, strongly supported the UK Presidency's aim of reaching political agreement on REACH at the November Competitiveness Council. Ministers' views were also sought on two specific issues within the dossier, in order to inform the continuing negotiation. The Council was fairly evenly split on the question of whether substances in articles should be subject to a separate, specific regime. The final question was o n the notification of substances of very high concern, where the Presidency approach was widely supported although a number of Member States thought there was scope for an exemption where exposure of humans and the environment to such substances could be excluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/4">Council adopted a set of conclusions on climate change. The conclusions underlined the EU's commitment to delivering on its Kyoto Protocol targets and its financial commitments on climate change, and agreed our approach for the forthcoming COP11-COP/MOP1 in Montreal. We looked forward to the adoption of the Marrakech accords, and expressed our wish to obtain agreement on a process for beginning negotiations at Montreal on a post-2012 framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/5">Also in relation to climate change, we heard a point from Poland under Other Business that suggested some issues for review in relation to the EU's emissions trading scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/6">At lunch we were joined by-the Chair of the European Parliament's Environment Committee, Karl-Heinz Florenz, and began our discussion of &quot;Better Regulation&quot;, which was continued in a formal Council debate after lunch. There was strong support within the Council for the view that better regulation tools, and in particular impact assessments, could help in delivering better environmental outcomes in the most effective way. It helps to provide a mechanism for the integration of environmental considerations into all Community policies, as the Treaties require. A number of delegations noted the importance of considering the costs of inaction in evaluating the options, and there was widespread agreement that impact assessment must assist in political decision-making, not replace or delay it.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/7">A relatively short list of AOB points included, in addition to the emissions trading item above, information from the Commission on its communication on tackling the climate change impacts of aviation emissions, and on progress on its proposal for a review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. Spain and Portugal reported on the 5th meeting of the Ibero-American Forum of Environment Ministers, and the Netherlands raised the issue of the need for adequate funding for environmental matters in the 7th Research Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/8">Denmark requested an urgent future discussion on the potential benefits of, and the need for further EU funded research on, genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Luxembourg submitted a paper calling for a discussion focused on the need for change to the EU's approvals regime for GMOs. The Commission suggested that a full debate would be best timed after a WTO hearing on GMOs expected early next year. The Presidency concluded that a significant number of delegations wanted a debate, and it was agreed that the Commission would produce a short paper as the basis for a short, initial discussion at the <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-02">2 December</phrase> Environment Council.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-10-31a.35WS.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform" colnum="35WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051031/wmstext/51031m04.htm#51031m04.html_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/1">The Pathways to Work model was launched in seven Jobcentre Plus Districts in October 2003 and April 2004. These Districts were:</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/2" class="indent">Derbyshire</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/3" class="indent">Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Argyll and Bute</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/4" class="indent">Bridgend, Rhondda, Cynon and Taff</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/5" class="indent">East Lancashire</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/6" class="indent">Somerset</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/7" class="indent">Gateshead and South Tyneside</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/8" class="indent">Essex</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/9">I would like to update colleagues on the very encouraging results from the pilots and announce implementation dates for the next phases of rollout.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/10">We are seeing an 8 percentage point increase in the number of people coming off incapacity benefit within six months. This remains an early tentative but extremely encouraging finding. The evidence from the Pathways to Work pilots continues to far exceed our expectations. The number of people with a health condition or disability in the seven pilots who have found work now exceeds 17,000. Over 14,000 incapacity benefit customers have voluntarily accessed some element of the choices package to help them move back towards work. This includes 6,660 people who have attended the innovative Condition Management Programme, delivered through our successful partnership with the Department of Health, NHS and Primary Care Trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/11">Overall, more than 21 per cent. of all new customers who have a Work Focused Interview go on to access choices provision. Pathways to Work is making a real difference to the lives of people on incapacity benefit. We are undertaking a rigorous evaluation of the programme and that evaluation will inform our programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/12">In the December 2UU4 Pre-Budget Report my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the expansion of Pathways to Work to an additional 14 Jobcentre Plus districts. These Districts serve Local Authority areas with the highest concentrations of incapacity benefit customers. This will allow us to focus resources on those areas where Pathways to Work will have the greatest impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/13">The expansion will be implemented in three phases from October 2005 through to October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/14">I can therefore announce that the first phase of this expansion has today been launched in the following Jobcentre Plus Districts:</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/15" class="indent">Cumbria</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/16" class="indent">Glasgow</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/17" class="indent">Lancashire West</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/18" class="indent">Tees Valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/19">The remaining Districts to follow next year are:</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/20" class="indent">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April 2006</phrase>: Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster; City of Sunderland; County Durham; Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire; Liverpool and the Wirral; Greater Manchester Central; Swansea Bay and West Wales;</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/21" class="indent">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October 2006</phrase>: Eastern Valleys; Greater Mersey; Staffordshire.</p>
