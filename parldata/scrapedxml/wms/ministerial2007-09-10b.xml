	<p pid="b.113WS.5/1">This is to announce a new procedure for dealing with suspected dishonest conduct for indirect taxes, where neither criminal investigation nor the Civil Investigation of Fraud procedure outlined in Code of Practice 9(2005) is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.113WS.5/2">Code of Practice 9(2005) covers HMRC investigations of suspected serious fraud against the Exchequer where, for policy or operational reasons, it is considered inappropriate to launch a criminal investigation. Where cases are not suitable for Code of Practice 9 (2005) or criminal investigation, for direct taxes, it is already possible for income tax self-assessment and corporation tax self-assessment inquiries to lead to penalties being imposed for either negligent or fraudulent conduct. However until the new penalty provisions in clause 96 and schedule 24 of Finance Bill 2007 take effect, there is no equivalent procedure for dealing with lower level fraud in relation to indirect taxes, with the exception of civil evasion penalties issued at the ports for customs duties and import VAT.</p>
	<p pid="b.113WS.5/3">This statement announces a new procedure which will enable HMRC to tackle cases where dishonesty is suspected in relation to indirect taxes. It also introduces a new public notice 160 outlining that procedure. This will bring current practices more closely in line across direct and indirect taxes and help enable a smoother transition to the new penalty regime put forward in clause 96 and schedule 24 of the Finance Bill 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.113WS.5/4">The procedure complements HMRC's policy of providing a level playing field for all businesses by supporting those who wish to comply but dealing more severely with those who seek an unfair advantage through non-compliance. It will be used in appropriate cases after <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.113WS.5/5">A copy of the new notice, PN160, is being placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth (John Healey)</phrase>, the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, made a statement concerning the taxation of bingo. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.114WS.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The policy of applying VAT and duty to bingo participation fees is entirely consistent with our treatment of other player-to-player games in licensed premises, such as poker played in casinos&quot;. [<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-04-30.1303"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 April 2007; Vol. 459, c. 1303</phrase>.].</p>
	<p pid="b.114WS.1/3">Similar statements have also been made in response to numerous letters and parliamentary questions from hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.114WS.1/4">I regret to inform the House that these statements were based on an incorrect understanding of the effect of the legislation relating to gaming duty as set out in the Finance Act 1997. In fact the Finance Act 1997 does not apply gaming duty to participation fees for poker played in casinos, so participation fees for poker played in casinos are liable only to VAT.</p>
	<p pid="b.114WS.1/5">I apologise to the House for this misunderstanding.</p>
	<p pid="b.114WS.1/6">I can, however, assure the House that HMRC have, nevertheless, been applying the law correctly, and casinos have not been required to account for gaming duty on participation fees for poker.</p>
	<p pid="b.114WS.1/7">In the light of the effect of the current legislation relating to gaming duty, I will be looking again at the tax treatment of participation fees for player-to-player gaming in casinos.</p>

	<p pid="b.115WS.2/4">new policies to define broad areas for regeneration and growth in the black country,</p>
	<p pid="b.115WS.2/5" class="indent">a new policy which replaces Dudley with Brierley Hill/Merry Hill as a strategic centre,</p>

	<p pid="b.115WS.2/7" class="indent">revisions to the transport priorities to reflect the current status of transport proposals in the black country.</p>
	<p pid="b.115WS.2/8">In addition, an appropriate assessment of the proposed changes has been completed and the recommendations incorporated.</p>
	<p pid="b.115WS.2/9">I have today written to the WMRA with the proposed changes and indicating areas where views are particularly sought from any interested parties. There will now be a public consultation period on the proposed changes, which will end on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-09">9 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.115WS.2/10">Copies of the relevant document is available in the Libraries of both Houses and has been provided for all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>

The franchise will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-09">9 December 2007</phrase>, and will continue until <phrase class="date" code="2015-03-31">31 March 2015</phrase> with the last 17 months conditional on set performance levels being reached.

The contract with NXEC Trains Ltd. makes provision from December 2010 for up to 25 extra train services&mdash;around 14,000 seats&mdash;each weekday and up to 40 more carriages to deliver increased capacity. Until then, the current timetable will continue to be operated in the new franchise, including Leeds half-hourly service improvements introduced in May 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.116WS.5/4">The additional capacity from 2010 would enable a new London&mdash;Lincoln service to operate at two-hourly intervals, and an additional London&mdash;York service to operate at two-hourly intervals. Faster journeys will also be possible between London and Leeds, York and Edinburgh. NXEC Trains Ltd. will reduce delays for which it is responsible by 29 per cent. by March 2015. It will work closely with Network Rail to raise the public performance measure to over 90 per cent. by January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.116WS.5/5">NXEC will invest &pound;7.4 million to upgrade station facilities. Up to 2000 more car parking spaces will be provided by the end of the franchise with half of these expected within the first two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.116WS.5/6">Environmental improvements have also been secured. Fuel consumption per passenger-kilometre will be reduced by 28 per cent. and four stations will be designated as &quot;green stations&quot;. Pre-series inter-city express trains, which will replace the current fleet of high speed trains, will be trialled on the east coast main line from summer 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.116WS.5/7">On-board improvements include CCTV on all trains and free wi-fi for all passengers. A full restaurant service on 87 weekday services will be offered. A hot food at seat service will be available to standard class passengers.</p>
	<p pid="b.116WS.5/8">The Government will continue to limit annual rises of regulated fares&mdash;which include season tickets and saver fares&mdash;in line with national policy, which is currently RPI+1%. Unregulated fares will be, as with all franchises, the responsibility of the operator.</p>
	<p pid="b.116WS.5/9">NXEC have indicated that they may wish to raise unregulated fares by an average of 2.1 per cent. above inflation each year over the course of the franchise. Overall, regulated and unregulated fares together are likely to rise by RPI+1.6% each year throughout the course of the franchise. Annual rises in regulated fares will continue to be capped at RPI+1%.</p>
	<p pid="b.116WS.5/10">An improved website will be introduced that will highlight the cheapest tickets available and the expected seat availability on each train. Smartcards will be introduced by 2010.</p>
