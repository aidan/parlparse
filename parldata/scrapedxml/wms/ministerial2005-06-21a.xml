<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-21a.31WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence" colnum="31WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050621/wmstext/50621m01.htm#50621m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.31WS.2/1">The Royal Navy will commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar and the death of Admiral Lord Nelson with a special programme of events in Portsmouth and the Solent between <phrase class="date" code="">28 June</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">3 July</phrase>, and then in London and Portsmouth over the anniversary weekend 21&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">23 October</phrase>. A wreath will be laid off Cape Trafalgar on <phrase class="date" code="">21 October</phrase>, the actual anniversary, and there will be commemorations in Gibraltar in late October.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.2/2">The Royal Navy's Trafalgar 200 programme forms part of the Trafalgar festival which is at the heart of the SeaBritain 2005 initiative sponsored by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. SeaBritain 2005 aims to raise the profile of the United Kingdom's maritime interests. The Trafalgar 200 programme of events will also strengthen the Royal Navy's maritime partnerships, help develop interoperability and build on multinational maritime cooperation. The Trafalgar 200 programme provides a major vehicle for the Ministry of Defence to promote public awareness and support for defence in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.2/3">The Trafalgar 200 programme starts with an international fleet review in the Solent on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase> in the presence of HM the Queen, members of the royal family, Ministers and Heads of foreign navies. Some 160 vessels, comprising Royal Navy, foreign warships and auxiliaries, merchant ships and tall ships, will take part in the review, which will conclude with a flypast of 50 aircraft. In total, 36 navies are expected to send ships, with 57 heads of navies in attendance. There will be a Son et Lumi&eacute;re on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase> in the approaches to Portsmouth harbour which will illustrate an early 19th century sea battle. While not a full re-enactment of Trafalgar, the show includes aspects of the battle, notably Admiral Lord Nelson's death at the height of the action; it will involve some of the world's finest tall ships. On the <phrase class="date" code="">29 June</phrase> an international drumhead ceremony will be held on Southsea common in the presence of HRH the Duke of York, accompanied by HRH Prince Michael of Kent. The ceremony will honour maritime veterans of all nations and commemorate those who have given their lives in conflict and service in the Armed Forces. Finally, and international festival of the Sea will be held from <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-03">3 July 2005</phrase> in HM naval base Portsmouth. In addition to a significant number of the warships and tall ships taking part in the fleet review, a substantial number of smaller vessels will join the festival which will be open to ticket-paying members of the public. The festival will showcase Britain's armed forces with displays by members of all three services.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.2/4">The programme of events in the autumn will commence with wreaths being laid off Cape Trafalgar and at Nelson's tomb in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase>, the 200 anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar and the death of Admiral Lord Nelson. As is customary, a service will also be held onboard HMS Victory in Portsmouth. A special VIP dinner will be held in HMS Victory on the evening <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase>. On the morning of <phrase class="date" code="">23 October</phrase> the sea cadets will conduct their annual parade in Trafalgar square and in the afternoon a national service of commemoration for all those who fought at Trafalgar will be held in St. Paul's Cathedral, in the presence of senior members of the royal family. In the evening we plan to hold a public celebration of Britain's maritime heritage (&quot;past, present and future&quot;) in the special setting of Trafalgar square.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.2/5">Although not formally part of the Trafalgar 200 programme in the United Kingdom, events are also planned to take place in Gibraltar during the weekend of 28 to <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase> to commemorate the close historic links between Gibraltar and Admiral Lord Nelson's victory. In addition to a service of remembrance at the Trafalgar cemetery, there will be a Nelson exhibition, beating retreat and a Royal Navy ceremonial guard mount at the Governor's residence. The Royal Navy has also been invited to exercise their freedom of the city privileges.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.2/6">Lying at the heart of SeaBritain 2005, the Trafalgar 200 programme represents an exciting and high profile series of events, funded through a combination of public funding and commercial sponsorship and revenue, commemorating our greatest naval hero and a major milestone in maritime history. The last fleet review by Her Majesty the Queen was held to mark the Silver Jubilee in 1977. There have been international festivals of the sea in Portsmouth in 1998 and 2001.</p>

	Armed Forces (Redundancy)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-21a.32WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="32WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050621/wmstext/50621m01.htm#50621m01.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/1">Current redundancy compensation terms for members of the regular armed forces have remained largely unchanged since the early 1970s and do not reflect changes to re-employment prospects or in wider Government policy for this area. Nor do they take account of the changes in benefit structure made under the new armed forces pension scheme. They have therefore been reviewed, working closely with the single services and I now wish to announce the outcome of that review.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/2">The new terms are designed to compensate fairly those whose careers are prematurely shortened as a result of redundancy, and are to be used as part of any planned restructuring of the armed forces as announced by the Secretary of State for Defence from time to time. The Ministry of Defence has two schemes which provide normal early-leavers' benefits for the regular armed forces&mdash;one relating to the 1975 pension scheme and one to reflect the changes made to the value of mid-career benefits with the introduction of the new 2005 scheme. Despite the differences between these two schemes, the redundancy packages for each scheme will be broadly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/3">The new terms will continue to be made up of a one-off tax-free lump sum which, for those serving until or beyond mid-career, will be supplemented with an immediate pension paid under the armed forces pension scheme 1975 (AFPS 75) or income paid under the 2005 early departure scheme. The size of the lump sum and of the annual pension or income stream will, as now, vary according to length of service and pay. The 2005 terms will apply to all new entrants from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>, but from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase> for those who were in service on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase> and who decide to transfer to the new pension scheme. The existing terms, as set out in AFPS 75, will remain unchanged until <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase> when the current drawdown in service manpower announced in July 2004 by the then Secretary of State is due to complete. They will then be replaced by new terms which, in particular, will defer the point at which the current very early immediate pension is paid. This can currently be paid from age 30 but in future only a lump sum will be paid at this very early age. To ease the transition, the replacement terms for AFPS 75 will be phased in over a five-year period from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2013</phrase>, after which the final terms will apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/4">The new arrangements will provide the armed forces with cost-effective arrangements for managing any major drawdown in the level of service manpower and are expected to meet fully the manning needs of the armed forces. Although less valuable in a number of respects than the existing terms, they remain generous by wider standards, as befits the special demands of a career in the armed forces; they reflect changes in wider Government policy for public service schemes; and they are fair with respect to the relationship between level of compensation and length of service. Additional general information on the new arrangements is available on both the MOD's intranet and internet sites, while detail about the new terms will be made public when work on drafting the new rules has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/5">I am today placing copies of the defence instructions and notices (DIN) on the new redundancy terms in the Library of the House. It is also being placed on the Ministry of Defence website at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/pensions/">www.mod.uk/issues/pensions/</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.33WS.1/1">As part of our normal process of keeping force levels under review, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) Northern Ireland, in consultation with the Chief Constable of the PSNI, has concluded that once the 1st Battalion King's Own Scottish Borders come to the end of their tour as the Omagh resident battalion in August 2006, there is no requirement for them to be replaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.1/2">This change is based on the GOC's and Chief Constable's assessment of the security situation, and reflects the increasing success of the PSNI in dealing with the threat from terrorism without routine military support. The Army remains committed to providing the support that the PSNI require to counter the threat from terrorism and to prevent potential public disorder. Consequently, we will continue to keep force levels in Northern Ireland under regular review.</p>

	<p pid="a.34WS.5/1">In March 2004, the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Northern Ireland was asked by the then Secretary of State, my right hon. friend Paul Murphy MP, to conduct a review of current systems for carrying out checks on individuals working with children in Northern Ireland. I have received the review report, which will be published by the Commissioner today. Copies of the report will be placed in the libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.5/2">The review was chaired by Ruth Lavery, a Barrister at Law, and was commenced following publication of the Bichard Inquiry report into the tragic events at Soham, which resulted in the deaths of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells. Taking into account the findings of Sir Michael Bichard, the aim of the review was to identify deficiencies in the present system and opportunities for reform, with a view to providing greater protections to children in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.5/3">It gives me great pleasure to welcome this report, which supports and endorses the huge amount of work being taken forward across Government, both in Northern Ireland and in partnership throughout the United Kingdom. There have been a number of significant developments in Northern Ireland within the last number of months, including the commencement of legislation, the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults Order in April 2005, which aims to strengthen safeguards for children and vulnerable adults. In addition, implementation of the Police Act later this year will create a statutory system of disclosing information, relevant to employment decision-making. The report makes 37 recommendations. Of the 36 that are targeted at government, 30 (more than 80 per cent.) have already been acted on, are being acted on, or are actively being considered. The remaining six will require either clarification or further consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.5/4">The Commissioner has also identified five important areas for action that he believes should guide and underpin the current reforms. In the main, they relate to establishing mechanisms or methods of ensuring that policy and legislation are translated effectively in practice. I am extremely grateful to the Commissioner for bringing forward this important work. I would like to pay tribute both to him and especially Ruth Lavery for her report. I can assure the House that these crucial issues will be taken fully into account as the Government deliver stronger safeguards to protect children.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.5/5">I have agreed with the Commissioner that I will provide him with a written report on progress by government on all recommendations within three months. I have also agreed that he will review implementation of the actions after 12 months. On a final point, it is my intention to appoint a Minister for Children from my ministerial team. The designated Minister will have responsibility for all issues affecting children in Northern Ireland, including child protection. I will ask the Minister for Children to keep me fully informed of progress on all of the vetting review recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.35WS.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Attorney General has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The Government have decided that after the summer recess it will seek affirmative resolutions from both Houses of Parliament in order to implement section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Section 43 made provision for serious and complex fraud trials to be conducted by a judge sitting without a jury. The provision can operate only where the</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/3" class="indent">judge is satisfied that the length or complexity of the trial is likely to make it so burdensome upon the jury that the interests of justice so require, and the Lord Chief Justice gives his approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/4" class="indent">This decision has been taken in the light of discussions at a seminar held in January of this year, following a commitment to further consultation that was given by the Government when the 2003 Act was passed, at which Opposition spokesmen, the judiciary, prosecuting authorities and the legal profession were amongst those represented. I am placing a record of the seminar proceedings in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/5" class="indent">A protocol for dealing with lengthy trials, which was issued by the Lord Chief Justice on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March 2005</phrase>, emphasises the need for robust and well-informed case management to enable the court to focus on the real issues, and it is hoped that this approach will contribute towards reducing the length of trials. The Government consider, however, that better case management will not of itself be sufficient to confine the duration of the most complex serious fraud trials within reasonable bounds, or prevent such trials from imposing an intolerable burden upon the jury.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.2/6" class="indent">The Government therefore propose to take the action necessary to obtain parliamentary approval for the implementation of section 43, with a view to bringing it into force in January 2006.&quot;</p>
