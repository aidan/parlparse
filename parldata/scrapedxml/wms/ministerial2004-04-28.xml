	<p pid=".41WS.2/1">From September this year, Jobcentre Plus, in partnership with the National Health Service and the Learning and Skills Council, will begin a pilot on Merseyside of &quot;Ambition: Health&quot;. This new initiative will provide local workless people with the skills for good jobs in the NHS. Those who gain employment as a result will receive further support and training to gain qualifications and a sound basis for career progression.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.2/2">&quot;Ambition: Health&quot; will be the fifth of the Ambition programmes to be developed by the National Employment Panel and delivered by Jobcentre Plus.

	<p pid=".41WS.5/1">I am today publishing &quot;Valuing People: Moving Forward Together&quot;, the Government's second annual report on learning disability services. The report describes progress made in implementing the programme of action set out in the White Paper &quot;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (Cm 5086) and responds to &quot;Rights, Independence, Choice and Inclusion&quot;, the second annual report of the learning disability taskforce, which was published in February this year.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/2">&quot;Valuing People&quot; is a cross-Government strategy. In last year's annual report, &quot;Making Change Happen&quot; (HC 5114), we acknowledged the learning disability taskforce's concern that Government as a whole was not giving enough priority to people with learning disabilities and undertook to talk to Government Departments about learning disability and the impact of their work on people with learning disabilities. &quot;Valuing People: Moving Forward Together&quot; reports on that work and describes areas where departments have worked with, or will be working with, learning disabled people to ensure that they can be more fully included in society. It records a wide range of activity covering many aspects of daily life:</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/3" class="indent">The Department of Trade and Industry plans to work with people with learning disabilities to make sure that Consumer Direct provides information in a way that they can understand.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/4" class="indent">The Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills are jointly supporting a conference later this year on parenting and people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/5" class="indent">Under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Supporting People initiative, more than &pound;400 million has been allocated to services for people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/6" class="indent">The Department of Health has awarded the Home Farm Trust &pound;194,000 over three years to set up a self sustaining national network of organisations supporting family carers who have adult relatives with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/7" class="indent">The Department for Transport has funded a project with Transport for London and a self-advocacy group to make buses and tubes in London easier for people with learning disabilities to use.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/8" class="indent">The Department for Constitutional Affairs has been consulting people with learning disabilities over the Mental Incapacity Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/9">Today's report, like last year's, is written in an accessible form, using pictures and straightforward, jargon-free language. We commissioned people with learning disabilities from the London Consultative Group to advise us on making the report accessible and I should like to acknowledge the help we received from them. It is important that people with learning disabilities can see for themselves what is being done to improve the services they use and to increase the opportunities available to them to lead the type of life the rest of us take for granted.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/10">&quot;Valuing People&quot; said that it would take a minimum of five years for its programme to be implemented. We are now over half way through that period and continue to make good progress.</p>
	<p pid=".41WS.5/11">Copies of &quot;Valuing People: Moving Forward Together&quot; have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".44WS.2/1">I would like to inform the House of developments in relation to Cyprus since my written statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase>. In that statement I described how, after talks in Cyprus and in Switzerland between the parties, and also with the leaders of Greece and Turkey, the UN Secretary-General produced a final version of his comprehensive settlement proposals. I looked forward to the referendums scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-24">24 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/2">The House will know that the referendum in the Turkish Cypriot community was carried by a large majority, but that in the Greek Cypriot community the settlement proposals were opposed by a large majority. Accordingly the Annan plan&mdash;which was designed to be self-executing in time for a reunited island to enter the EU on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>&mdash;is null and void. The United Kingdom's offer of territory from the sovereign base areas, which as an integral part of the plan is also null and void.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/3">It follows that, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>. Cyprus will join the EU, but in the absence of a settlement the EU acquis will be suspended in the north of the island.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/4">On the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-24">24 April</phrase> I made the following statement, which I should like to raw to the attention of the House:</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/5" class="indent">&quot;For thirty years, the international community has supported the efforts of Cypriots on both sides to resolve their differences and put an end to the tragic division of the island.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/6" class="indent">Over the last few years, Kofi Annan and his team have built on earlier efforts and worked tirelessly to bring about a comprehensive settlement package that meets the key interests of the two sides, and provides a solid foundation for a durable bi-communal, bi-zonal federal solution.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/7" class="indent">Britain has always given its strong support to the efforts of the UN and of those on both sides who have shown the courage to seek a realistic compromise solution.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/8" class="indent">We will respect the choice that the Greek Cypriots have expressed today. But I hope that they will continue to reflect on whether this choice is the right one for them. By this decision a majority of Greek Cypriot voters has rejected the settlement, despite the prospect it offered of reuniting the island, providing long-sought relief for the refugees of 1974 and progressively lifting the weight of militarisation&mdash;all this within the framework of political stability and economic security which European Union membership provides.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/9" class="indent">I am glad that the Turkish Cypriot community has voted so clearly for the settlement. The result shows what a fundamental change of attitude has taken place within the Turkish Cypriot community in recent years.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/10" class="indent">I understand very well their wish to end their isolation in the world, to join with Greek Cypriots in a reunified island, and to move together into the European Union that is the best guarantee for the future of their collective security and prosperity. I want them to know that this remains our goal too, and that we will continue to work for its ultimate realisation.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/11" class="indent">Meanwhile, I would like to assure all Cypriots that, if at any point in the future both communities decide in favour of a comprehensive settlement which would reunify the island in the European Union, the United Kingdom, as a guarantor power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and a leading EU member state, not to mention a long-standing friend and supporter of Cyprus, will be exerting all its efforts to ensure that the settlement is the practical and political success which Cypriots have for so long deserved&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/12">These were the policies which I advocated at the 26 April meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg. They met with wide agreement from our European partners. There was regret that the union's strong preference for accession by a reunited Cyprus had not proved possible. But there was also determination to build upon the positive aspects of the situation, including the contribution of the Governments of Greece and Turkey, and&mdash;in particular&mdash;the pro-EU, pro-settlement vote of the Turkish Cypriot community. The conclusions in respect of Cyprus issued by the council on Monday were as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/13" class="indent">&quot;The council noted the results of the referenda in Cyprus on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-24">24 April</phrase> and expressed its strong regret that the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus will not now be possible on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>. The council expressed its deep appreciation for the determined and sustained efforts of the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and his colleagues in the search for a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus problem. The council also welcomed the contribution made by Greece and Turkey. It expressed its determination to ensure that the people of Cyprus will soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/14" class="indent">The Turkish Cypriot community have expressed their clear desire for a future within the European Union. The council is determined to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community. The council invited the Commission to</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/15" class="indent">bring forward comprehensive proposals to this end, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island and on improving contact between the two communities and with the EU. The council recommended that the 259 million euros already earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement now e used for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/16" class="indent">The council asked COREPER to expedite discussion of the Regulation on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol 10 of the Act of Accession with a view to its adoption before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>, taking due account of the council's desire to send a signal of encouragement to the Turkish Cypriot community that its future rests in a united Cyprus within the European Union&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/17">By these and other means we intend to demonstrate Europe's concern for the well-being of Turkish Cypriots. In the same spirit, I have noted the announced intention of the Cyprus Government to support the economic strengthening of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate trade.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/18">As these conclusions indicate, neither the UK nor the EU as a whole is proposing any change in our long-standing and consistent policy of non-recognition of &quot;TRNC&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/19">We look forward to a report from the Secretary-General during the course of May about he future of his good offices mission.</p>
	<p pid=".44WS.2/20">We continue to believe that the Annan plan represented the best available blueprint for settlement. 1 share the UN Secretary-General's hope, expressed after the &quot;no&quot; vote on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-24">24 April</phrase>, that the Greek Cypriot electorate may arrive at a different view in the fullness of time, after a profound and sober assessment of their decision.</p>

This enables us to rank small areas according to their level of deprivation. The indices are used by Government and other agencies to identify where there are concentrations of disadvantaged people, so that resources can be targeted where there is greatest need.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/3">The new index is a significant improvement on previous indices. It uses a new base geography, which is more consistent over time and in terms of size. This allows us to overcome some of the problems with electoral wards, which were of varying sizes and which were regularly changed. The new super output areas allow us better to identify where very small pockets of deprivation exist and to track changes over time.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/4">We have also been able to include new indicators that give a more precise measurement of particular aspects of deprivation. For example, with the new pupil level annual school census, we are able to attribute educational deprivation to the area where the child lives rather than attributing it to the school, as was the case in the past. We have also overcome previous problems with crime data and have now included a crime domain for the first time. There is also a new living environment domain, which aims to identify deprivation in the indoors and outdoors living environment. Both of these new domains were strongly supported in the two periods of public consultation held to determine the best process for updating the 2000 index.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/5">The index also allows us to rank local authority districts. Districts are complex to describe as a whole and as a result, six different measures have been designed which focus on different aspects of multiple deprivation in the district. No single measure is favoured over another, as there is no single best way of describing or comparing districts. The six measures are:</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/6" class="indent">The Concentration is an important way of identifying districts' hot spots of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/7" class="indent">The Extent portrays how widespread high levels of deprivation are in a district.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/8" class="indent">The Income Scale measure gives the number of people in the district who are income deprived.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/9" class="indent">The Employment Scale measure gives the number of people in the district who are employment deprived.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/10" class="indent">The Average of SOA Ranks summarises the district as a whole, taking into account the ranks of both the deprived and least deprived SOAs.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/11" class="indent">The Average of SOA Scores also describes the district as a whole, taking into account the full range of SOA scores across a district.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.2/12">The table below summarises the districts that are amongst the 50 most deprived on each of the six district measures.</p>
