<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2011-03-31a.29WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40343" speakername="Edward Davey" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills" colnum="29WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110331/wmstext/110331m0001.htm#11033144000212">
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/1">Everyone who is affected by insolvency is entitled to have confidence that insolvency procedures are used fairly and that insolvency practitioners deliver the best possible outcome in what are often difficult and challenging circumstances. It is particularly important that suppliers, who often extend credit on unsecured terms, have confidence in the insolvency regime, as a lack of confidence is likely to restrict the availability of credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/2">I am today announcing measures to improve transparency and confidence in pre-packaged (pre-pack) sales in administration. These will help ensure that in these cases as much is fairly returned to creditors as possible. These measures are in line with the policies of this Government to drive balanced and sustainable growth and will provide real benefits to business.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/3">The merits of pre-pack sales have continued to be the subject of much debate. In response to the concerns raised, the previous Government launched a consultation exercise in March 2010. The responses make it clear that the greatest cause for concern is where the business and assets are sold back to the current management or a connected party-something that is often referred to as &quot;phoenixism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/4">I recognise that pre-pack sales offer a flexible and speedy means of rescue and can be the best way of maximising returns for creditors. I do not wish to outlaw them. But they must be done fairly and reasonably. Where such sales are at undervalue, creditors get less than they should. Competitors who pay their debts in full also suffer. I want to make sure that creditors have a fair chance to have their voice heard. I also want to enable others to scrutinise such transactions after the event to ensure that deals being struck are fair in the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/5">In order to inject greater transparency into the process I intend to require administrators to give notice to creditors where they propose to sell a significant proportion of the assets of a company or its business to a connected party, in circumstances where there has been no open marketing of the assets. This will enable creditors to express concerns, which the administrator would need to consider, or to make a higher offer for the assets, and in cases where the circumstances justify it, apply to the court for injunctive relief. These options can be exercised before the sale has taken place, and therefore reflect concerns raised by stakeholders in their responses to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/6">The new requirements will apply not just to pre-packs but to any sales back to connected parties in an administration where there has been no open marketing of the assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/7">Administrators already need to provide a detailed explanation of why a pre-pack sale was undertaken to creditors in compliance with professional standard Statement Of Insolvency Practice 16. These will in future need to be included in their administration proposals which are lodged at Companies House, making the information available to business as a whole, including, for example, credit reference agencies. This information may be of particular interest to suppliers and others considering doing business with the purchasing company. Administrators will also need to confirm that the sale price represents, in their view, best value for the creditors.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/8">We are today also publishing a report on compliance with the Statement Of Insolvency Practice 16 (a professional standard setting out what information must be disclosed to creditors in pre-packs) during 2010. Overall levels of compliance have increased, showing that in the great majority of cases necessary statements are now being given (after the event) to creditors. However in a minority of cases the information is insufficient, and in these cases the concerns have been reported to the relevant authorising body. My officials will be liaising with the various bodies to ensure that there is a consistent approach taken to lack of compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/9">A copy of the consultation and summary of responses, together with the report on compliance with the Statement Of Insolvency Practice 16, can be found on The Insolvency Service's website at <a href="http://www.insolvency.gov.uk">www.insolvency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.30WS.4/1">Since the June Budget 2010 the Government have been developing a new approach to tax policy making, with consultation on policy and scrutiny of legislation as the cornerstones.</p>
	<p pid="a.30WS.4/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December 2010</phrase> the Tax Consultation Framework was published in draft for comment. Today the Government are publishing their response to the comments received including the finalised framework showing amendments made to the draft version.</p>
	<p pid="a.30WS.4/3">Respondents have generally welcomed the framework as a positive step towards achieving the Government's aims of predictability, stability and simplicity for the tax system. Many of the suggestions have been incorporated into the finalised framework, while others will be addressed through the guidance and training provided to policy officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.30WS.4/4">Responding to feedback from interested parties the Government are also publishing today their updated tax consultation tracker which is available on the HM Treasury website at: <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/tax_updates.htm">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/tax_updates.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.30WS.4/5">The new version of the tracker includes specific anticipated launch dates wherever possible, to help representative groups and others manage their engagement with the Government on tax policy development.</p>

	<p pid="a.31WS.2/1">I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-26">26 January 2011</phrase> that I had asked my noble Friend Lord Currie of Marylebone to undertake a fundamental review of the Government's single source pricing regulations, which include the Government Profit Formula (GPF) overseen by the review board for Government contracts. In the announcement I said that the review board has been asked to maintain the existing arrangements pending the outcome of Lord Currie's review (which is due to report in July 2011), and to complete their 2011 annual review of the GPF.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.2/2">The Government have subsequently considered and accepted the review board's recommendations in their 2011 annual review, and all changes have been agreed with industry. This will reduce the profit and capital servicing allowances payable by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on new single source work that is placed after <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>. An agreed change to the GPF methodology will be of benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises; and agreed changes to Government accounting conventions setting out the treatment of costs in single source pricing will improve the MOD's negotiating position. The board's recommendations will be implemented in accordance with arrangements subsequently agreed with the industry side and recorded in an addendum to the published report. I will be placing a copy of the report in the Library of the House. The recommendations will be implemented for new single source work with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.31WS.4/1">I am pleased to lay before Parliament today the service complaints commissioner's third annual report on the fairness, effectiveness and efficiency of the service complaints system.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.4/2">The commissioner continues to provide an independent oversight of the system and has been effective in beginning to drive improvements in the way in which we handle service complaints. She has added value and challenged the services' established ways of working.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.4/3">The Ministry of Defence and the services have worked closely with the commissioner over the last three years to take practical steps to implement her recommendations for improving further the service complaints process. I and the service chiefs welcome the fact that this report acknowledges the progress that has been made, and the initiatives that have been implemented in a number of the areas since the first report was published in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.4/4">While progress has been made, we recognise that we can improve further the manner in which we handle complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.31WS.4/5">I will provide a formal response to the commissioner once I and the services have had time to consider in full the findings of the report and the recommendations made.</p>

	<p pid="a.32WS.1/1">Today we have published the most recent figures on the mortality of veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, covering the period <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-01">1 April 1991</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase>. These figures have been published as a national statistic notice on the Defence Analytical Services and Advice website.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/2">The data for Gulf veterans are compared to that of a control group known as the &quot;Era cohort&quot; consisting of armed forces personnel of a similar profile in terms of age, gender, service, regular/reservists status and rank, who were in service on <phrase class="date" code="1991-01-01">1 January 1991</phrase> but were not deployed to the Gulf. As in the previous release, the &quot;Era&quot; group has been adjusted for a small difference in the age-profile of those aged 40 years and over, to ensure appropriate comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/3">Key points to note in the data are:</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/4" class="indent">There have been 1,193 deaths among the Gulf veterans and 1,216 in the age-adjusted Era comparison group.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/5" class="indent">The 1,193 deaths among Gulf veterans compare with approximately 1,998 deaths which would have been expected in a similar sized cohort taken from the general population of the UK with the same age and gender profile. This reflects the strong emphasis on fitness when recruiting and retaining service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.1/6">These statistics continue to confirm that UK veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict do not suffer an excess of overall mortality compared with service personnel that did not deploy.</p>

	<p pid="a.34WS.2/1">I wish to inform the House that I have received evidence suggesting that a very small minority of farmers in the south-west and midlands have been illegally swapping cattle eartags to retain TB test-positive animals in their herds and sending other less productive animals to slaughter in their place. The suspected fraudulent activity is now subject to formal investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/2">If this kind of practice is taking place it is totally unacceptable. We are taking immediate action to prevent activity of this kind happening in future, and any farmer who tries to cheat the system should know that they will be identified and prosecuted. I should stress that the health risks to consumers from this suspected fraud are very low.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/3">Anyone who retains TB test-positive cattle increases the risk of disease spread within their herd, to their neighbours' herds, and to wildlife. We are moving quickly to introduce new measures to prevent this occurring in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/4">In particular, from mid-April DNA tags will be applied immediately to cattle that test positive for TB. This quick action is only possible because of the commitment and support of the veterinary profession, for which I am grateful. Animal Health will then cross-check on a random sample basis and, where there is any suspicion of eartag tampering, the DNA of TB test-positive animals against the DNA of animals sent to slaughter.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/5">I would emphasise that the vast majority of cattle farmers fully comply with TB control measures, but their considerable and tireless efforts to help us control this terrible disease risk being undermined by an irresponsible minority. I am confident that our quick and decisive action, including the DNA tagging of TB reactors, will help protect the interests of all cattle farmers.</p>

The movement in spend from Resource DEL to Capital DEL is in respect of flood defences where the exact nature and classification of the expenditure is determined by the Environment Agency, as they undertake the work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2011-03-31a.35WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40545" speakername="James Paice" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="35WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110331/wmstext/110331m0001.htm#11033144000222">
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/1">In my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-04">4 March</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2011-03-04.47"><i>Official Report</i>, column 47-48WS</phrase>, I updated the House on the Rural Payments Agency's (RPA) progress in both addressing its daunting legacy of errors in relation to the single payment scheme (SPS) and ensuring that accurate payments under the SPS 2010 reached farmers as soon as possible. In that statement I explained I was considering additional measures to speed the flow of SPS 2010 payments and, following discussions in the RPA oversight board, I can now report on the decisions that have been reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-04">4 March</phrase>, RPA has continued to make SPS 2010 payments as claims are validated, and to undertake further work to identify those that are ineligible and not, therefore, due a payment for this year. As a result, the agency calculates that there are now in the region of 6,300 eligible claims remaining to be paid, with a combined value of around &#163;215 million. The frustrations felt by these farmers have been made very clear to me, both directly and through farmers' representative bodies. They want both the remaining sums paid as soon as possible and a line to be drawn under the legacy issues so uncertainty over past years is removed and greater confidence is provided that subsequent scheme year payments will not be affected. The oversight board shares these aims and has been looking very closely at how the former can be achieved without significantly impacting on the latter.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/3">Against that background, the oversight board has now approved two decisions which, between them, should ensure that less than 1% of the monetary value of SPS 2010 payments remains outstanding at the end of the regulatory payment window which closes on the <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June</phrase>. This would be in line with, or would better, performance in previous years and would ensure the EU requirement to make 95.238% of payments by <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-30">30 June</phrase> is met, thus avoiding late payment penalties.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/4">The first decision is that, after rigorous testing on a sample to ensure accuracy of the process, fully validated manual payments will be made to approximately 2,000 farmers under the 2010 scheme who would otherwise not be paid until after the payment window. These payments will be made over the next two months and take account of known entitlement corrections that have yet to be fully processed on the agency's systems. Should there be any additional changes identified once payment has been made, the farmers concerned will be informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/5">The second decision relates to those remaining SPS 2010 payments where there are outstanding queries on earlier scheme years. Where the SPS 2010 claim has been fully validated, payment for that scheme year will now be made. Should any changes be identified for earlier scheme year payments in due course, the farmers concerned will be informed. RPA plan to complete the work required before the opening of the SPS 2011 payment window on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-01">1 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/6">The net result of these decisions is that the flow of remaining SPS 2010 payments will now increase. The oversight board did additionally consider requests from various sectors of the industry to make partial payments. However, RPA's analysis suggests that this would not significantly increase the speed at which remaining claims are paid to farmers, but would add disproportionately to the backlog of corrective work required and introduce additional risks of EU fines. Consequently, it was agreed that the agency should not make partial payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/7">In order that all farmers with payments outstanding at the end of March understand how these decisions might affect them, RPA will be writing to each of those concerned next week to explain what issues remain on their claims and the likely month of payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/8">Alongside this work, RPA will continue to review the remaining backlog of potential error cases that need to be reviewed. Corrective work undertaken to date, combined with earlier decisions by the oversight board on ensuring entitlements were regularised wherever legally possible, has made a real impact to date. The board will be monitoring these efforts closely to ensure a line is finally drawn under all the legacy data issues over the coming year.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/9">I will continue to keep the House informed on the agency's progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.37WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-08">8 March</phrase> I issued a written statement to the House-<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2011-03-08.59"><i>Official Report,</i> column 59WS</phrase>-announcing that Tom Winsor had published the first report of his review of remuneration and conditions of service for police officers and staff in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/2">We have the best police force in the world, but I said when the review was launched, it is vital that we have a modern and flexible service to meet the demands placed on it. The Government recognise and value the professionalism of the police and have made clear their commitment to supporting and maximising front line services to the public. Police officers and staff should be rewarded fairly and reasonably for what they do. They deserve to have pay and work force arrangements that both recognise the vital role they play in fighting crime and keeping the public safe and enable them to deliver effectively for the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/3">The Government have also been clear that action is needed to tackle the deficit responsibly to ensure that the taxpayer gets a fair deal from all parts of the public sector. The police service has its part to play, and in an organisation like the police, where pay is 80% of police revenue expenditure, there is no question that pay restraint and pay reform must form part of the package. In this context, it is more important than ever that the police leadership has the flexibility to manage forces and protect the front line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/4">The review has an important role in enabling the police service to do this. Tom Winsor was asked to look at how remuneration arrangements and conditions of service for police officers and staff can best support and enable the police service to serve the public and provide value for money for the public taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/5">In particular, the terms of reference asked for recommendations on how to:</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/6" class="indent">use remuneration and conditions of service to maximise officer and staff deployment to front line roles where their powers and skills are required;</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/7" class="indent">provide remuneration and conditions of service that are fair to and reasonable for both the public taxpayer and police officers and staff;</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/8" class="indent">enable modern management practices in line with practices elsewhere in the public sector and the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/9">In recognition of the urgency of these matters, the review was asked to report in two stages: the first on short-term improvements and a second report on longer-term reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/10">The Government have now had the opportunity to consider the review's first report. It sets out the following broad principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/11" class="indent">Fairness is an essential part of any new system of pay and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/12" class="indent">The Office of Constable is the bedrock of British policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/13" class="indent">The demands of policing should be given full and proper weight.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/14" class="indent">People should be paid for what they do, the skills they have and are applying in their work, and the weights of the jobs they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/15" class="indent">People should be paid for how well they work.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/16" class="indent">A single police service-distinctions in pay and other conditions of service between police officers and staff should be objectively justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/17" class="indent">Arrangements should be simple to implement and administer.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/18" class="indent">Phased introduction of reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/19">We welcome these principles, and believe that they provide a framework for fair and sustainable arrangements for remuneration and conditions of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.1/20">The review also sets out a package of specific recommendations for police officers' and staff remuneration and conditions of service, based on these guiding principles. I have consulted the Independent Chair of the Police Negotiating Board and Police Advisory Board for England and Wales and I will direct those bodies to consider the proposals that are within their respective remits for police officers in England and Wales as a matter of urgency. I will also be writing to the Association of Police Authorities and the Police Staff Council to recommend that they consider the report's recommendations in respect of police staff in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.38WS.1/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is today laying before the House a statement of changes in the immigration rules that will bring about the first of the changes to the student visa system, which I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-22">22 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.1/2">The changes will take effect on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-21">21 April</phrase> and will introduce an interim limit on those sponsors who do not currently meet the new accreditation criteria and will limit the number of students they can sponsor. These rules changes also implement the changes to the English language requirement so that those coming to study at degree level will have to speak English at an upper-intermediate level. Others will have to speak English at an intermediate level. We are also publishing a statement of intent on the UK Border Agency website which sets out the detail of the proposed policy changes to tier 4 and I will arrange for a copy to be placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.1/3">This statement of changes also includes some changes to the tier 4 rules to clarify some existing rules and to bring some requirements into the rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.1/4">We are also making some minor amendments to rules laid on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-16">16 March</phrase>, relating to prospective entrepreneurs and tier 2 intra-company transfers. We are also correcting omissions from the new criminality requirements at settlement and to clarify the application of the new settlement rules for highly skilled migrant programme participants.</p>

	<p pid="a.39WS.2/1">I am announcing today the launch of Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service as an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice. It brings together Her Majesty's Courts Service and the Tribunals Service into one integrated agency providing support to the judiciary in the administration of justice in courts and tribunals.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/2">The agency is responsible for the administration of the criminal, civil and family courts and tribunals in England and Wales and non-devolved tribunals in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It provides for a fair, efficient and effective justice system delivered by an independent judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/3">I believe that operating as a single organisation will provide the platform to improve accessibility, drive up quality and provide a better environment for service users. Integration will enable those who need to use the agency's services to do so in a simple and straightforward way, using a single point of access. Bringing corporate functions together will remove duplication in management functions and enable efficiencies which do not impact on front line services. Integration will also enable more efficient use of the combined estate, using facilities flexibly across jurisdictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.2/4">Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service uniquely operates on the basis of a partnership between the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals as set out in Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Framework Document. I have laid this document before Parliament today.</p>
