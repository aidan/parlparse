	<p pid=".72WS.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local and Regional Government has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid=".72WS.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Today the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is publishing the 2005&ndash;06 fire and rescue national framework.</p>
	<p pid=".72WS.2/3" class="indent">The Government remain committed to reduce the number of fire deaths and deliberate fires. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's fire public service agreement target commits us to achieving long-term reductions in fire deaths and arson, including in the worst off areas. The Government also recognise the fire and rescue national framework sets out the strategy for meeting the Government's objectives and delivering an improved service that achieves better value for money for the communities it serves.</p>
	<p pid=".72WS.2/4" class="indent">At the request of fire and rescue authorities we agreed to publish the 2005&ndash;06 national framework in time to inform authorities' budget setting processes. The 2005&ndash;06 national framework reflects progress that has been made since the publication of the 2004&ndash;05 national framework in July 2004 and reflects comments we have received in response to our consultation exercise. We have carefully considered all responses and have reflected them in the national framework where appropriate. The Government's full response to the comments is published on the ODPM website.</p>
	<p pid=".72WS.2/5" class="indent">The national framework is a forward looking document. Fire and rescue authorities will soon begin the process of comprehensive performance assessment. Fire CPA will provide a robust assessment of progress by the service since publication of the White Paper and a firm basis for further improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".72WS.2/6" class="indent">The 2005&ndash;06 national framework has effect under section 21(6) of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 as a revision, which appears to the Secretary of State to be significant, of the 2004&ndash;05 national framework.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-12-06.77WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1083" speakername="Denis MacShane" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe" colnum="77WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041206/wmstext/41206m02.htm#41206m02.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".77WS.2/1">In September 2004 the Government issued a licence for the export of ballistic body armour vests to the Ministry of Security in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ministry of Security requires the vests for the State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA). SIPA is responsible for, inter alia, diplomatic protection, which includes the British embassy in Sarajevo as well as the mission of EU partners and other rallies; tackling organised crime; and investigating war crimes.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.2/2">An EU arms embargo has been in place against Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1996. The purpose of the embargo was to aid the establishment of peace and stability for the people of the region, taking into account in particular the need to ensure the safety of international troops and civilian personnel deployed. The embargo was amended in 1999 to exclude de-mining equipment and the transfer of small arms to the police.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.2/3">We fully support the EU embargo. However, we are, in limited circumstances, prepared to make exemptions where denying an export would frustrate the purposes of the embargo. The UK has been active in encouraging Bosnia and Herzegovina to take greater responsibility for maintaining the rule of law and strengthening civilian policing. I am confident that granting this exception is fully consistent with this responsible approach of supporting the development of civilian policing while respecting the aims of the embargo.</p>
