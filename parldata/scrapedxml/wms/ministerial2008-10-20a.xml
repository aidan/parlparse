<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-10-20a.3WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice" colnum="3WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081020/wmstext/81020m0001.htm#0810201000067">
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/1">The seventh annual Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) reports are published today. The MAPPA bring together the Police, Probation and Prison Services in each of the 42 areas in England and Wales into what is known as the MAPPA &quot;Responsible Authority&quot;. Other agencies are under a duty to co-operate with the responsible authority; including social care, health, housing and education services.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/2">The aim of MAPPA is to protect the public from the risks posed by serious and complex offenders, and they do this in two ways. First, by ensuring the production of risk management plans that benefit from the information, skills and resources provided by the individual agencies being co-ordinated through MAPPA. Secondly, by focusing multi-agency MAPPA management on the cases that need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/3">One of the most notable developments last year was the roll out of ViSOR, the Violent and Sex Offenders Register, to every probation area and every prison in England and Wales. This means that the Police, Prison and Probation Services, working together through MAPPA, have the same key information about offenders, including details of current risk management plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/4">It is also clear that the MAPPA agencies are increasingly robust in dealing with non-compliance by these offenders, many of whom pose the highest risk of harm of all offenders under supervision. Offenders managed at MAPPA levels 2 and 3 are increasing likely to be recalled to prison for breaching sexual offences prevention orders, and registered sexual offenders more likely to be charged or cautioned for breaching the notification requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/5">These are the headlines but a great deal of work has gone on in the past 12 months to improve the way we manage dangerous offenders. Immediately after last year's reports were published in October 2007, revised national MAPPA guidance was published. The new guidance incorporated the learning from the previous three years' of research, case review and inspection findings and implemented seven of the recommendations of last year's child sex offender review.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/6">These included changes to formalise procedures for disclosing information about dangerous offender to people outside of MAPPA where this is necessary to improve risk management plans. Section 140 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which came into force in July, supports these procedural changes by requiring all 42 MAPPA responsible authorities to consider disclosure in all cases involving child sex offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/7">The annual reports describe how the arrangements work locally and include key public protection achievements in each of the 42 police and probation areas of England and Wales. They report on progress against local business plans, outline next year's plans, and provide contact points for further information. They also provide statistical information on the number of offenders eligible for the MAPPA and how they are managed.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/8">Copies of every area report are being made available to the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-10-20a.4WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1594" speakername="Paul Clark" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="4WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081020/wmstext/81020m0001.htm#0810201000068">
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/1">The Blue Badge (Disabled Parking) Scheme provides a vital lifeline to 2.3 million disabled people in England. The value of the badge, in terms of independence cannot be understated, as 75 per cent. of badge holders say that they would go out less often without a badge.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/2">Having listened to the views of badge holders, the general public and disability groups about how the scheme can be improved, I am today announcing the &quot;Comprehensive Blue Badge (Disabled Parking) Reform Strategy England&quot;. This strategy contains a suite of commitments that will be taken forward over the next five years, that are designed to radically reform the scheme in a manner that is right for the 21st century. Copies of the strategy have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available from the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/3">I want to ensure that the maximum number of people, who have a genuinely severe disability, can benefit from the scheme. That is why the strategy contains a commitment to extend the scheme to people with certain significant temporary mobility problems (lasting at least one year,) individuals with severe mental impairments, seriously disabled veterans and more children, under three, with specific medical conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/4">Assessments will be made fairer and more consistent&mdash;local authorities will receive up to &pound;15 million per year to conduct improved independent medical assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/5">We will explore options for improving the badge renewal process, from a customer perspective, for people with permanent and degenerative disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/6">Nine local authorities have been awarded the status &quot;Centre of Excellence&quot; in administering and enforcing the scheme. They will receive &pound;500,000 to share good practice and drive up improvements in management of the scheme with other local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/7">We plan to enable local authorities to charge a badge application fee&mdash;which has remained unchanged at &pound;2 since 1983&mdash;that is more appropriate to their costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/8">Badge holders and motorists are particularly concerned about abuse of the scheme, through theft, forgery or borrowing of disabled badges by non-disabled people. I am committed to preventing this, and the strategy outlines a number of anti-abuse measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/9">Up to &pound;10 million will be provided to local authorities, over the next three years, so that they can establish a system of data-sharing to reduce fraudulent misuse of badges. The scope for on the spot seizure of badges being used unlawfully by non badge holders, will be examined. Badge security features will also be improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/10">A range of communication activity will take place to highlight the blue badge reform strategy. This will include messages about the impact that abuse has on disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/11">There is a commitment to support the British Retail Consortium in doing more to tackle disabled parking abuse in their members off-street car parks.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/12">Relevant authorities in London will be asked to gather evidence to determine whether parking restrictions currently placed on badge holders visiting central London should be relaxed.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/13">Once the domestic reforms are complete, greater foreign reciprocity of the badge will be explored.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/14">I am also publishing today a summary of responses to the Department's recent public consultation on the scheme, which will be placed in the House Libraries, and have formally responded to the Transport Select Committee Enquiry on the Blue Badge scheme.</p>
