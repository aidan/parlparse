	<p pid="a.93WS.5/1">My right hon. and noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following written ministerial statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.93WS.5/2" class="indent">&quot;The Government are today publishing for consultation the draft Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2007, which give effect to the changes the Government announced they were minded to make on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.93WS.5/3" class="indent">The draft regulations will extend the existing provisions by allowing public authorities to include reading time, consideration time, and consultation time in the calculation of the appropriate limit, above which requests could be refused on cost grounds; and aggregate all requests made by a person or persons who appear to be acting in concert or pursuance of a campaign to each public authority within a period of sixty working days for the purposes of calculating the appropriate limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.93WS.5/4" class="indent">An independent economic review of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act commissioned by my Department and published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October 2006</phrase> found that a small percentage of requests and requestors were placing disproportionately large burdens on public authorities in terms of the costs of officials' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.93WS.5/5" class="indent">Whilst the Government believe it is entirely right that a reasonable amount of resource is spent dealing with requests for information we believe, in light of experience, that the existing provisions need to be amended in order to provide the right balance between access to information for all and the delivery of other public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.93WS.5/6" class="indent">The draft regulations will allow public authorities to take into account more accurately the work involved in dealing with an FOI request.</p>
	<p pid="a.93WS.5/7" class="indent">The draft regulations are being published for a 12-week consultation with responses being invited by <phrase class="date" code="">8 March 2007</phrase>. The consultation paper, which includes a partial regulatory impact assessment, will be sent to key stakeholders. The consultation paper is available on my Department's website at <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk">www.dca.gov.uk</a>&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-12-14a.94WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" speakeroffice="The Minister for Sport" colnum="94WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061214/wmstext/61214m0001.htm#06121471000220">
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/1">The Government have decided, after much consultation and deliberation, to retain the Horserace Betting Levy Board (Levy Board) and the associated horserace betting levy scheme. It is doing so on the basis that the scheme continues to reflect and balance the legitimate needs of racing against the ability of bookmakers to pay in accordance with the prevailing economic position.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/2">The Government announced their intention to abolish the levy board and the levy mechanism in March 2000. This policy was approved on the basis that the horseracing industry was confident that a commercially based alternative funding mechanism was available and requested that the Government abolish the levy board in order that it could fully exploit these new commercial opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/3">The sport proposed to substitute the statutory levy income with a commercial arrangement based on the sale of pre-race data (runners, riders etc), primarily to bookmakers both here and abroad. The Government, preferring commercial arrangements between industries, brought forward legislation in the form of the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004 to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/4">A judgment by the European Court of Justice in November 2004 cast serious doubt over the sport's ability to enforce substantial payments for the use of its data and, as a result, the viability of the proposed replacement funding model. The Government have since engaged in lengthy discussions with the racing and betting industries on future funding arrangements, resulting in the establishment of an independent Future Funding of Racing Review Group (FFRRG), chaired by Lord Donoughue.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/5">The FFRRG reported earlier this year concluding that a secure alternative funding mechanism to the levy, which at &pound;90 million to &pound;100 million per annum represents a significant proportion of the sport's income, was not presently available. The loss of the levy, without a commercial replacement of comparable value, would have serious and immediate adverse consequences for the racing industry, as well as knock-on effects to other related businesses, notably the betting industry and those within the rural economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/6">Given the importance of the present statutory system, the Government have decided to retain the levy until such time as a secure and adequate alternative commercial funding arrangement can be identified. It also intends to repeal the sections of the existing legislation providing for the levy board's abolition, to ensure that Parliament may be permitted to debate such a measure in light of the prevailing circumstances at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/7">In the meantime, the Government propose to modernise the existing levy mechanism with a view to removing as many of the unnecessary administrative burdens as possible and will consult stakeholders on the form and content of those changes in the new year. The Government also welcome the horseracing industry's commitment to modernise and establish a new governing and regulatory body from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.95WS.2/1">I am pleased to announce that QinetiQ have been awarded the contract to operate the subsonic target element of the Combined Aerial Target Service (CATS) programme worth &pound;364.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.95WS.2/2">This contract marks a significant step forward towards the delivery of the CATS project. In line with Defence Industrial Strategy it will provide a rationalised supplier base for MOD and will produce savings in the order of 10 per cent. of the total cost over the 20 year life of the contract. It will also mean we have a single service provider for subsonic aerial targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.95WS.2/3">This contract is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement within which QinetiQ will supply and operate subsonic aerial targets for the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.95WS.2/4">Supersonic aerial targets will be procured by the Ministry of Defence from the US because they are the only country who currently produces supersonic targets that are available to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.100WS.4/1">I am pleased to announce the publication of the independent Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) Complaints Audit Committee (CAC) annual report for the year 2005 to 2006. Copies are available in the House and on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate website.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.4/2">This is CAC's 12th report. Its role is to monitor the effectiveness of IND's procedures for handling complaints. The annual report highlights a number of areas where IND needs to improve its performance, supported by a number of specific recommendations, many of which confirm findings of the IND review in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.4/3">We very much welcome the report and its findings, which chime with July's IND review.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.4/4">For the first time this year IND's response, which includes full details of the work it is doing to improve its complaint handling procedures, has been published at the same time. Copies of this are available with the CAC's report.</p>

	<p pid="a.101WS.1/1">I am pleased to inform the House that I have today placed in the Library the annual report of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate for the year 2005. This is the second annual report published by the Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.101WS.1/2">Publication of the report honours a commitment given by the Government in response to a recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures in July 2002 that more information should be made available about the work of inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.101WS.1/3">In the Government's response, published in January 2003, we welcomed the Select Committee's endorsement of the integrity of the inspectorate and of the important contribution that it has made to the welfare of animals in designated establishments. We also recognised that public awareness of the valuable job done by the inspectorate needed to be improved and concluded that this could be remedied, at least in part, by the publication of an annual report on its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.101WS.1/4">The inspectorate's second annual report published today provides an account of how the inspectorate has carried out its main tasks and other work in 2005, and contains a particular focus on two important areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.101WS.1/5">First, it gives a brief introduction to the issue of the acquisition of non-human primates for use in scientific procedures and details the acceptance process and criteria used to determine the suitability of overseas centres that propose to supply UK laboratories with such animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.101WS.1/6">Secondly, it addresses in detail the growing use of fish in scientific procedures and explains their major uses during the year. This focus on fish includes information on the role of genetically altered fish, the types of housing required, water quality and other general issues to explain handling, methods of identification and how behaviour is judged as well as environmental enrichment.</p>
	<p pid="a.101WS.1/7">The report explains what the inspectors do and how they do it, and provides details of the inspectorate's staffing and structure, ways of working, professional background and skills, and training and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.101WS.1/8">The report also explains the inspectorate's key role in assessing and advising Home Office Ministers and officials on applications for personal and project licences and certificates of designation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. It also provides details of the inspection system, through which compliance with licence authorities granted under the 1986 Act is monitored and provides information about visiting patterns and practice and the number of visits carried out during the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.101WS.1/9">I commend the report to the attention of Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.102WS.8/1">The Government are today launching a 12 week consultation on their proposals for changes to the charging regime at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing (the Crossing). A draft charging order, consultation document and regulatory impact assessment have been drawn up and are available for inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.102WS.8/2">The Department has been reviewing the charging regime in the light of current traffic levels, likely future demand and broader transport policy considerations. The proposed charging regime sets charges for cash payment and discounts for those who pay by an electronic 'Dart-Tag' and pre-pay account.</p>

	<p pid="a.102WS.8/12">The Government are also seeking comments on suggestions from local Members of Parliament that discounts be made available for local residents, and comments on proposals for reinvestment of the revenue collected through the charging scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.102WS.8/13">The draft charging order authorises the exemption from the charging regime of certain motor vehicles as set out in schedule 4 to the draft charging order and enables variations to be made to the regime in line with the retail price index.</p>
	<p pid="a.102WS.8/14">Notice of the consultation has today been given in the London Gazette. Notices will follow in the appropriate local newspapers.

	<p pid="a.103WS.3/1">I am today publishing a progress report on &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper, 2003. Copies are available in the Libraries of both Houses and Vote Office. This document fulfils a commitment to report on progress made in implementing the White Paper by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.3/2">The progress report confirms the detailed strategy set out in 2003 for the sustainable development of air travel out to 2030, balancing the growing aspirations to travel and the economic benefits that it brings with the need to protect the environment. The progress report confirms our earlier assessment that demand for air travel will continue to grow strongly. In line with the conclusions of Sir Rod Eddington's recent study on transport infrastructure, it acknowledges the benefits that meeting this demand brings to business and to individuals across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.3/3">The Government reaffirm their commitment to the development of the aviation sector, predominantly through making the best use of existing capacity, and ensuring that where new capacity is required its provision is in line with our environmental obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.3/4">In 2003, the White Paper made clear the importance of taking effective international action to tackle aviation's contribution to the global challenge of climate change. The report demonstrates the action that we are taking to ensure that the aviation sector meets its external climate change costs. The Government intend to introduce a new emissions cost assessment, which will be an assessment of whether the aviation sector is meeting its external costs of climate change. This will inform Ministers' decisions on major increases in aviation capacity. We intend to consult on this proposal next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.3/5">The report confirms our continued strong support for the inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme. We are committed to achieving this as soon as practicable. Since aviation is excluded from the Kyoto protocol we will push hard for the modernisation of the Chicago convention and the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to make it easier for negotiations there to deliver international progress on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.3/6">The document clearly sets out our intended next steps in delivering the Government's aviation policy. We are committed to reporting again on our progress in implementing these policies in three to five years' time.</p>
