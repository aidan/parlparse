	<p pid="b.47WS.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has today announced the award of a contract to AgustaWestland for the Integrated Merlin Operational Support (IMOS) programme, part of the wider Defence Logistics Transformation Programme, which seeks to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of military logistics support to the front line.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.2/2">IMOS is a radical departure from the current method of supporting the Merlin helicopter: in-service support of the Navy and Air Force Merlin variants will be fused, under IMOS, into a single, innovative, availability-based contract. IMOS will focus support activities for Merlin at the main support base recently established at RNAS Culdrose. It will provide comprehensive technical servicing including supply and depth servicing, and it will incentivise industry to improve aircraft availability to the Front Line while reducing costs through-life.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.2/3">The 25-year contract is worth approximately &pound;450 million over the first five years and will result in approximately 20 per cent. savings&mdash;some &pound;1 billion, over the 25 year life of the aircraft. The IMOS programme will complement the Defence Logistic Organisation's broader strategy to relocate the majority of support to the single most effective site, which is already showing early success with the Harrier and Tornado Fleets.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.2/4">As set out in the Defence Industrial Strategy, the MOD is working to establish a Multi-Platform Strategic Partnering Arrangement with AgustaWestland. IMOS is a key element of this strategy which sets out to enable the delivery of improved output at reduced cost to the MOD while allowing industry to benefit from greater openness and business opportunity.</p>

The focus of the European Council will be its annual review of the strategy for growth and jobs set out at Lisbon in March 2000 and re-launched last year. The presidency hopes the European Council will identify a series of priority actions to be implemented by the end of 2007 to fulfil these commitments. These priority actions should form a good basis on which to implement the second cycle of the Lisbon strategy in spring 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.2/5">In a short discussion, Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy Commissioner Wallstrom welcomed the annotated draft agenda particularly the focus on economic and energy issues.

If Belgrade's co-operation with the ICTY does not improve, the Commission would be obliged to disrupt SAA negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.2/12">CFSP High Representative Solana briefed the Council on the efforts of his personal representative. Ambassador Mirolsav Lajcak, to forge consensus between government and opposition parties in Montenegro on the modalities for the proposed referendum on the future of the state union with Serbia.

The possibility of exemptions might also apply in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.2/17">The presidency took note of the concerns expressed. These will be taken into account in future negotiations with a view to the Justice and Home Affairs Council taking a decision on 27/<phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.2/18" class="italic">Iraq</p>

	<p pid="b.51WS.2/1">Today I am pleased to announce the launch of the consultation on new proposals to update the topic selection process for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's work programme. As NICE's role has changed in the last 12 months and the institute has taken on its new public health responsibilities, it is the right time to look at changes to the process of topic selection.</p>
	<p pid="b.51WS.2/2">Topic selection is a critical part of the process of producing guidance. Deciding what questions we want to ask NICE on the clinical and cost effectiveness of treatments is often a good deal harder than getting the answers and no less important. It is therefore vital that the mechanisms we have in place for the selection of topics produce the questions on issues of real priority to the NHS and in the public health arena.</p>
	<p pid="b.51WS.2/3">While the existing process has served well over the past four years, topic selection needs to keep with pace with changes in both the NHS and NICE. We need the process to be more responsive and have more NHS and public health representation to ensure the topics going to NICE are the ones where advice is most needed. At the same time, the selection of public health topics must also be fully integrated into the new process so any impact these topics might have on the institute's other work programmes can be identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.51WS.2/4">The consultation will begin on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March 2006</phrase> and ends on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June 2006</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.52WS.2/1">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 makes provision for the use of animals for education and training. In considering project licence applications for education and training, the Home Office defines education as the transfer of knowledge or the ability to formulate and test hypotheses, and training as the development or maintenance of manual skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.2/2">In practice, project licences for training purposes have been issued only for the training of practising surgeons in micro-vascular techniques, when applicants could demonstrate that no alternative methods could achieve the specific training objectives. However, the 1986 Act does not prohibit the authorisation of projects for training in other manual techniques and applications for other categories of training in manual skills can be considered. After very careful consideration, the Home Office has recently granted a licence under the 1986 Act to train a small number of personal licensees in a specialist injection technique to enable progress to be made towards developing and introducing a novel test method that will allow a particular therapeutic product to be evaluated using a mouse model rather than the currently used non-human primate model. I am satisfied that this animal use is justified as an exception to our general policy that licences will usually only be granted for training in micro-vascular techniques and that the requisite level of technical competence could not be obtained by other means.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.2/3">The exception made is specific to this application and programme of animal use. It is not intended as a broader change in policy on this issue.</p>
