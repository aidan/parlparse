	<p pid="c.28WS.2/1">In May 2006, the then Veterans Minister announced that the Ministry of Defence would later this year be introducing an enhanced post-operational mental healthcare programme for recently demobilised reservists. He undertook to make a further announcement to confirm the details of the service.</p>
	<p pid="c.28WS.2/2">I am now pleased to be able to confirm that the programme, to be known as the &quot;Reservists Mental Health Programme (RMHP)&quot;, will become operational with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-21">21 November 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.28WS.2/3">The programme is open to any current or former member of the UK Volunteer and Regular Reserves who has been demobilised since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> following an overseas operational deployment, and who believes that the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health.</p>
	<p pid="c.28WS.2/4">An individual who thinks that they are eligible, and who would like an assessment, should ask their GP for a referral. This is the preferred method of contact, to ensure that both the GP and the RMHP assessors are kept aware of all the factors affecting the individual's health. Referrals from civilian psychiatric services are also accepted but the patient's GP is to be kept informed. In exceptional circumstances, individuals can contact the assessment centre directly. The programme is being co-ordinated by the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre (RTMC), Chilwell, Nottinghamshire.</p>
	<p pid="c.28WS.2/5">Eligible reservists will be offered a mental health assessment. This will be conducted at the RTMC by appropriately qualified members of the Defence Medical Services (DMS). If an individual is assessed as having an operationally/related mental health problem that is amenable to treatment by the RMHP, then they will be offered out-patient treatment by the DMS. This will be available at one of MoDs 15 Departments of Community Mental Health in the UK, who will offer treatment in consultation with the individual's GP. The programme will be monitored in order to ensure that it meets the needs of demobilised reservists. The programme will run for an initial period of three years, at which point there will be a formal review to decide whether it should continue, or be modified.</p>
	<p pid="c.28WS.2/6">Further details of the Programme are available at the RTMC website <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/rtmc/rmhp.htm">www.army.mod.uk/rtmc/rmhp.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.28WS.2/7">The Reserve Forces continue to make a vital contribution to the ongoing success of military operations. In return, we have a duty of care to them, and this new programme is an important enhancement to the medical services that we provide.</p>

	<p pid="c.30WS.5/1">The Government Actuary has reported on the results of his valuation of the Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS) as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>. His report, which takes account of the reforms to the TPS that will be introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, including the increase in the contribution rate paid by teachers from 6 per cent. to 6.4 per cent., recommends that, from that date, the employer contribution rate for the TPS should increase from the current rate of 13.5 per cent. to 14.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.30WS.5/2">The principal factor underlying the increase in the contribution rates relates to continuing improvements in life expectancy compared to the assumptions adopted in the previous valuation. The agreed package of TPS reforms will deliver savings on the employer contribution rate of some &pound;280 million a year compared to the contribution that would have been required if the existing scheme provisions had remained in place. This reform package, which includes an agreement on cost sharing between members and employers of any future changes in the contribution rate and a cap of 14 per cent. on the employer rate from the 2008 scheme valuation onwards, should ensure the long term financial sustainability of the TPS.</p>

	<p pid="c.31WS.1/1">Anne Lambert, UK Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU, attended the Youth Council on behalf on the UK, I represented the Government at the Education Council.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/2">Ministers discussed the following issues:</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/3" class="italic">Youth</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/4">1. The draft resolution on implementing common objectives for young people to promote their active European citizenship was adopted without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/5">2. Ministers exchanged views on &quot;better knowledge and understanding of Youth&quot;. They agreed that there was a need to support the development of youth policy with independent research based on practical experience. There was agreement that there should be a two-way relationship between policy and practice, with research concentrated in areas where policy decisions were most relevant to young people. The Council also endorsed the setting up of a EU database on youth policies to support implementation and evaluation. The UK tabled a paper, but did not intervene in the discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/6" class="italic">Modernising Higher Education</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/7">3. The Education part of the Council was dominated by a public debate on the EIT(European Institute of Technology) and the wider reform of higher education (HE) in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/8">4. On the latter, I underlined the crucial importance of the reform process and the supporting role of the EU. I noted that some progress has been made since Hampton Court, but we now need to inject a sense of urgency. Links between business and HE are needed to ensure the right supply of skills and qualifications for the labour market and widening participation. To this end I proposed that a compendium of best practice in modernising universities should be drawn up on the back of the ongoing peer-learning activity between member states. This was supported by the Commission and many member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/9" class="italic">EIT</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/10">5. Ministers gave a cautious welcome to the Commission's recent proposal. For the UK, I said the EIT's success would depend on its clarity of purpose. The focus on knowledge transfer is welcome. It is now crucial to ensure that the EIT provides value for money; we have concerns about the budget, and want to be sure resources will not be diverted from elsewhere. The Commission hopes the Regulation will be adopted by the end of 2007 and that two Knowledge and Innovation Communities would be up and running by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/11" class="italic">Vocational Education and Training</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/12">6. The Council adopted Conclusions on enhancing European co-operation in vocational education and training (VET). These will encourage Member States to develop strategies to raise skills levels and improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational training. The informal meeting of Education Ministers on 4-<phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase> will pursue this theme. The Commission flagged up two forthcoming initiatives: a Communication on adult learning; and a consultation on developing a European Credit Transfer System for VET.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/13" class="italic">Efficiency and Equity in Education and Training Systems</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/14">7. The Council also adopted Conclusions on efficiency and equity in education and training systems. These will encourage member states to develop education policies which produce the best outcomes for all groups in society, including disadvantaged young people. The presidency inserted a reference to member states' exclusive responsibility for the organisation of the education systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/15" class="italic">European Qualifications Framework</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/16">8. The Council agreed a general approach on the draft recommendation on a European Qualifications Framework (EQF). The EQF will give a model for comparing qualifications in different member states and thereby support mobility.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/17" class="italic">AOB</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/18">9. The presidency reported that the recommendations on education Key Competences and a Mobility Charter had been approved by the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.31WS.1/19">The French delegation presented a proposal for the development of a European teaching aid as an introduction to the history of the arts in Europe.</p>

	UN Climate Change Conference, Nairobi, November 2006
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-11-21c.38WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" speakername="David Miliband" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="38WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061121/wmstext/61121m0005.htm#0611225000544">
	<p pid="c.38WS.1/1">Last week I attended the 12th meeting of the Parties (COP12) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in Nairobi.</p>
	<p pid="c.38WS.1/2">It was clear from the discussions that the science of climate change is now overwhelmingly accepted. Sir Nicholas Stern, who was in Nairobi to present the findings of his review of the economics of climate change, has made a historic dent in the economic argument that the world cannot afford to reduce its emissions. The findings of the Stern review show that climate change, not action to tackle it, is the threat to growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.38WS.1/3">The conference therefore faced three tests. Firstly, to help developing countries, particularly in Africa, adapt to the consequences of climate change. The conference made good progress, reaching agreement on a five-year programme (the Nairobi Work Plan) which will help developing countries consider the impacts of climate change, their vulnerability, and how they can best adapt. Agreement was also reached on the principles of the Adaptation Fund which will finance concrete projects to help the most vulnerable countries adapt. The UK has committed to playing a full role in this work, and has so far committed over &pound;40 million to help build developing countries' understanding of how climate change will affect them and to improve integration of climate risks within development plans. The UN Secretary-General, who addressed the opening of the ministerial section of the conference, also committed the UN to work for 'carbon-proofing' of aid programmes which the UK is determined to support.</p>
	<p pid="c.38WS.1/4">Second, achieving real change in the decisions of the public and private sectors, and better joint-working, to drive investment in low-carbon technology. The UN Secretary-General announced an important initiative to help developing countries&mdash;especially those in Africa&mdash;to participate in the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (COM), by promoting greater coherence between the UN, bilateral and multilateral agencies. The UK supports the COM as a vital symbol of global commitment, and UK companies are now the largest investors in COM projects. We will play our part by linking London-based carbon market experts with those developing projects in Africa, and call on business to work with us to deliver early investment on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="c.38WS.1/5">Thirdly, the conference considered how to advance agreement on a global framework for emissions reductions to build on the first Kyoto commitment period which finishes in 2012. This needs to be based on the core principle of the UN Climate Change Convention: common but differentiated responsibilities, with every country part of the drive to prevent dangerous climate change, and each country making a contribution according to their circumstances. The UK also argued strongly for global agreement to be reached in time to ensure that there is no gap between commitment periods.</p>
	<p pid="c.38WS.1/6">In discussions under the Kyoto Protocol, those developed countries who have ratified the Protocol demonstrated their leadership in addressing climate change by establishing a substantial work plan for arriving at new reduction targets, which will send a clear signal to the carbon market that Parties are serious about reducing global emissions by at least 50 per cent. from 2000 levels. The Protocol (under Article 9) also provides for a review of implementation to be undertaken. An initial review took place at COP12 and there was further agreement on a process that would lead to a fully comprehensive review by 2008, which will look at how best we can build on the work that has already been done in implementing the Protocol to ensure that it remains fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.38WS.1/7">COP 11 in Montreal established a Dialogue to enhance the implementation of the Climate Change Convention. The second workshop under the Convention Dialogue, held during COP12, focused on advancing development in a sustainable way and on realising the full potential of market-based opportunities. Sir Nicholas Stern also presented his report to the workshop. The Dialogue provided welcome space for further deliberation and exploration of key issues facing the international community.</p>
	<p pid="c.38WS.1/8">During 2007, the UK will work across all fronts, including the EU, G8 and UN, to inject greater urgency and momentum into the process of driving down global emissions. The UK is committed to a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, and we are calling for an EU target of 30 per cent. greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2020 and at least 60 per cent. by 2050. The science tells us clearly that action is needed urgently: the economics tells us that we cannot afford not to act to ensure that global emissions peak over the next 10-15 years.</p>

	<p pid="c.44WS.2/46">The Department of Health DEL has increased by &pound;5,418,000 made up of transfers from the Home Office &pound;18,436,000 for prison healthcare services, the Department of Trade and Industry &pound;1,600,000 for changes in pension scheme calculations and the Cabinet Office &pound;457,000 (administration costs) for services of Parliamentary Counsel. These increases are offset by transfers to the Department for Education and Skills &pound;15,000,000 mainly for capital building programmes and childcare services and to the Home Office &pound;75,000 (administration costs) for a transfer of staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.44WS.2/47">The Department of Health's administration cost limit has increased by &pound;375,000 comprising a transfer to programme budgets of &pound;7,000 for library services and net inter departmental transfers of &pound;382,000 (detailed above).</p>
	<p pid="c.44WS.2/48">The changes to the Food Standards Agency resource element of the Departmental Expenditure Limit arises from an interdepartmental transfer from DEFRA, to be used in paying for the staff costs of the Wine Standards Board from July 2006 when the responsibility was passed on to the FSA. As a result of this, the administration costs of the Food Standards Agency will increase by &pound;415,000 from &pound;52,008,000, to &pound;52,423,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.44WS.2/49">The changes to the Food Standards Agency capital element of the Departmental Expenditure Limit arises from a take up of EYF to increase capital expenditure reflecting the Food Standards Agency's headquarters Capital Investment Programme. As a result of this, the Food Standards Agency capital costs will increase by &pound;300,000 from &pound;647,000 to &pound;947,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.52WS.1/1">My hon. Friend the then Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase> <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-07-21.155WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 155WS</phrase>, that we would begin last summer the initial phase of our programme of targeted screening for infectious tuberculosis (TB) of people seeking to enter the United Kingdom for longer than six months at the entry clearance stage in Bangladesh, Sudan, Tanzania and Thailand (which also processes entry clearance applications from Cambodia and Laos). We now intend to implement the main phase of the scheme in China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa and Zimbabwe. We are also considering the feasibility of introducing the scheme in a small number of further countries. A further written ministerial statement will be made prior to any roll out of the scheme in countries additional to those listed above.</p>
	<p pid="c.52WS.1/2">Pre-entry screening of travellers should be seen as an integral part of our wider effort to combat TB in the UK. The UK also provides significant support for global TB control through a number of different channels, including support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and the STOPTB partnership as well as support for research on the development of new effective and affordable drugs. Her Majesty's Government also provide support to countries to build capacity in their health services to diagnose and treat all major causes of illness including TB.</p>
