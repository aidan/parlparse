<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-02-21.1WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/839" speakername="Alistair Darling" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="1WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050221/wmstext/50221m01.htm#50221m01.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".1WS.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">Friday 18 February</phrase>, the High Court endorsed the key policies of the Air Transport White Paper, published in December 2003 (Command paper 6046). This judgment means that the Government's support for two new runways in the south-east of England in the period up to 2030 has been upheld.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/2">I have arranged for copies of the judgment (case reference CO/1314/2004 and CO/1339/2004) to be available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/3">Following the judgment, the Government will continue to support a new runway at Stansted as the first new runway in the south-east. It is for the airport operator to bring forward detailed proposals. These will be taken through the planning system in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/4">The Judge agreed the decision making process which led to the adoption of the policies in the White Paper was lawful subject to two minor qualifications. These were that the Government were too prescriptive with regard to the exact positioning and capacity of the runways at Stansted and Luton&mdash;this should be a matter for a planning inquiry. At Luton the airport operator's option will need full consultation before being taken forward.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/5">These are very important matters for local people and they will be able to express their views at a future planning inquiry, but the Government strongly agree with the Judge's comments that these are minor in relation to the national policies set out in the White Paper. The main thrust of the White Paper has been upheld and the Government will not therefore be appealing.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/6">Together with the decision taken by the Judge on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-21">21 January</phrase> to dismiss the Judicial Review application in relation to the policy on Gatwick Airport, this judgment leaves the way open for the Government to pursue their White Paper programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/7">This judgment allows the Government to pursue their objectives as set out in the White Paper and I confirm that it will do so as efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>
