	<p pid="b.14WS.5/1">I wish to inform the House about the Government's intentions concerning the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations (S.I. 2010/1228).</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/2">These regulations were laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-09">9 April 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/3">There is no doubt that ship-to-ship transfers require some form of regulation because of their potential for damage to the UK's seas and coasts. The regulations endeavour to address this in two separate and distinct ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/4" class="indent">they prohibit ship-to-ship transfers and bunkering operations outside harbour authority waters; and</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/5" class="indent">they put in place a legislative regime for assessing and licensing harbour authorities which propose to allow ship-to-ship transfers in their waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/6">I am aware that there have been concerns expressed by industry and by some hon. Members about some aspects of these regulations. I am also conscious that there are those who support the regulations in their current form.</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/7">The key objective has to be to ensure that the regulations are fit for purpose and do not apply additional, unnecessary burdens to industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/8">I am also committed to ensuring that the policy and legislative processes associated with the passage of the regulations are entirely proper and fully consistent with the principles of better regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/9">Accordingly, I am today announcing a review of the regulations. I would like to invite all interested parties-including hon. Members, local authorities, industry and environmental non-governmental organisations-to set out their views on the regulations by <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September</phrase>. I also intend to meet some of the interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.5/10">To allow the necessary time for this review to be carried out, I am today laying before the House a Statutory Instrument, the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (SI 2010 No.1769), which defers the entry into force of the regulations from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.14WS.8/1">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Budget statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June</phrase> that, with some exceptions, consumer prices rather than retail prices will be the basis for uprating most benefits and public sector pensions.</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.8/2">The Government believe the CPI provides a more appropriate measure of pension recipients' inflation experiences and is also consistent with the measure of inflation used by the Bank of England. We believe, therefore, it is right to use the same index in determining increases for all occupational pensions and payments made by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) and Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS).</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.8/3">Consequently we intend to use the CPI as the basis for determining the percentage increase in the general level of prices for the 12 months ending <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September 2010</phrase> when preparing the order required under paragraph 2(1) of schedule 3 to the Pension Schemes Act 1993 in relation to revaluation and indexation of pension rights in defined benefit pension schemes, and the order made under section 109 of that Act in relation to increases in guaranteed minimum pensions paid by contracted-out defined benefit schemes in respect of pensionable service between 1988 and 1997; and to amend legislation to enable CPI to be used for relevant increases in respect of the PPF and FAS.</p>
	<p pid="b.14WS.8/4">Using CPI will mean making some small changes to primary legislation to ensure we can apply it fully in every circumstance. We will bring these before Parliament at the earliest opportunity.</p>
