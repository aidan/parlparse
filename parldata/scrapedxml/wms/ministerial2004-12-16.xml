	<p>Members will wish to be aware of the publication on 16 December of the second annual report by the Government of the United Kingdom's contribution to the against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction. The second report details the progress made in the past 12 months in destroying and securing the former Soviet Union's legacies of WMD and associated materials and infrastructure.</p>
	<p>The UK pledged $750 million to the global partnership at the Kananaskis G8 summit in 2002. Since then the FCO, DTI, and MoD in close co-operation with the Russian Federation, other countries of the Former Soviet Union, Central and Eastern Europe and other funding partners, have developed a wide portfolio of programmes and made considerable progress on implementing projects on the ground which help to tackle these issues. In 2005 the UK in its capacity as G8 president intends to take forward the work of the global partnership under the theme of &quot;Pledges to Progress&quot;, focussing on effective project implementation.</p>
	<p>The international community faces immense challenges in tackling the legacy of cold war weapons of mass destruction left in the former Soviet Union. The cold war WMD programmes in the FSU have created a significant non-proliferation and environmental threat to us all. This work represents the UK's largest non-proliferation programme and, as the report indicates, we have made significant progress over the last 12 months in collaboration both with other donors nations and our partners in the FSU.</p>
	<p>Copies of the report are available in the Library of the House. Further reports will be published annually setting out the progress achieved in the work being undertaken by the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p>Further to the commitment my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), gave to the House in July 2003 that we would be taking part in a major UK/US exercise in 2005 as part of the Home Office's national exercise programme, and as a result of close co-operation with the US on joint crisis management issues, I would now like to provide the House with an update on developments.</p>
	<p>Exercise 'Atlantic Blue' is due to take place in April 2005 and is designed to test simultaneous responses to internationally linked terrorist incidents, focusing on how we communicate across international borders at a strategic level.</p>
	<p>The Metropolitan Police Service is the host force for the UK working closely with the Home Office and other Government Departments and London agencies on planning and delivery. For obvious reasons we will not be discussing the scenario before the exercise takes place.</p>
	<p>Exercise play in the US will be live while in the UK it will be a notional command post exercise (CPX) only. We have agreed this is the best way for us to focus entirely on strategic-level communication issues, rather than on the management of live play at an operational level, which is regularly rehearsed around the UK.</p>
	<p>The UK programme of exercises is among the best in the world and a vital part of our work in resilience and contingency planning. This exercise provides us with an invaluable opportunity to enhance our domestic exercise programme by working with our US counterparts in order to test our capability to respond to the specific challenges of an international terrorist incident.</p>
	<p>The exercise has been planned as a result of discussions between my predecessor and Cabinet colleagues, and the Department for Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and his colleagues, to promote a co-ordinated approach to counter-terrorism and homeland security issues.</p>
	<p>In order to develop the work of Atlantic Blue we are keen to pursue our involvement in future exercises with the US, both in terms of tabletop and live exercises which enable us to further develop our preparedness and resilience.</p>
	<p>I would like to reiterate that we are holding this exercise as part of sensible contingency planning with the aim of developing our joint preparedness and resilience in the event of a terrorist incident. It in no way reflects a change in the level of threat to the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-12-16.152WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/839" speakername="Alistair Darling" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="152WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041216/wmstext/41216m03.htm#41216m03.html_spmin4">
	<p>In July this year I told Parliament that because of excessive cost increases I would have to withdraw funding for the phase III extensions to Manchester Metrolink.</p>
	<p>Looking at the proposals, it has become increasingly clear there are real and persistent problems with the costs of the extensions. The public sector funding requirement has almost tripled since we first approved the project. Nevertheless, I have decided to commit over half a billion pounds, the sum previously agreed to fund phase III, to Manchester's transport network. Manchester will also be able to bid for additional funds from the new transport innovation fund. It is now up to the transport authority to come forward with proposals for how this funding is used.</p>
	<p>Looking at the history of the Metrolink proposals shows the problems it has had with huge increases in public funding requirements:</p>
	<p class="indent">In July 2000 public sector funding was approved with an up front budget of &pound;282 million, for three lines: to Oldham and Rochdale, Ashton and the airport; plus some upgrading of the existing system.</p>
	<p class="indent">In December 2002, this budget had to be increased to &pound;520 million (including &pound;60 million local contribution). We made clear that there would be no more money from the Department. The Manchester authorities accepted they would meet the costs of any further increases.</p>
	<p class="indent">In December 2003, GMPTE returned to ask us for still more money, but for a reduced project. The three new lines were reduced to two and a half, with the line to the airport replaced with a shorter spur to East Didsbury.</p>
	<p>The public sector funding requirement was going up and up&mdash;partly because of private sector, pessimism about light rail, and partly because of failings in the original cost estimates. There was no guarantee that costs would not continue to rise. This led to my decision last July to withdraw funding for this project, and to ask GMPTE to work with us to look at alternatives that would benefit Manchester, but at a better price.</p>
	<p>Following this decision, a working group was set up with GMPTE and chaired by Tony McNulty. Its purpose was to see whether light rail could be made affordable in Manchester and to consider alternatives. I also appointed my own financial and technical consultants.</p>
	<p>The potential cost to taxpayers of the proposed extensions is now clearer:</p>
	<p class="indent">GMPTE confirm that at least &pound;600 million public sector up front funding would be needed to build just two lines&mdash;Oldham-Rochdale and Ashton. Our judgement is that there is a strong chance that costs would be even higher.</p>
	<p class="indent">GMPTE told Tony McNulty on 7 December that about &pound;900 million of up front funding would be needed for delivery of the original three lines over the next 10 years&mdash;a tripling since the original approval. There is no guarantee this would not increase further.</p>
	<p>In the light of this, I have considered the options for the way forward. GMPTE want me to agree to their continuing with their current procurement for the three lines. That would mean committing to upfront public sector funding of &pound;900 million, when only four years ago we capped the figure at &pound;282 million. I cannot do that. No Government could ignore these huge increases&mdash;a three-fold increase in just four years. And accepting this price would consume too much of the money that will be available for transport including in the north-west in future years. In addition, a scheme for substantially less than three lines would need a new procurement or risk legal challenge. I have therefore told GMPTE that the current procurement should not be revived.</p>
	<p>Nor can I agree to GMPTE's alternative of starting a new procurement to enable construction of the three lines to be phased over a longer period. This would not address the fundamental problem of cost escalation.</p>
	<p>I am however confirming that the &pound;520 million budget is still available for Manchester, subject to GMPTE developing a satisfactory plan for these areas. This represents a major investment in Manchester, enabling a package of measures to address the transport problems in these parts of the city, which may include light rail improvements.</p>
	<p>We have already provided some &pound;170 million of the &pound;520 million. Around &pound;80 million was for GMPTE to buy the concession for the operation of Metrolink. This has continuing value to generate revenue for GMPTE and give them greater control over the tram network. The rest has been for advance works and buying land, some of which may still be required for the package that GMPTE now develop.</p>
	<p>GMPTE are able to supplement this budget, both from their own resources and by bidding for funding from government through the transport innovation fund. The TIP is available for authorities which propose innovative and coherent schemes to tackle congestion and encourage modal shift which could act as exemplars for others facing similar challenges. This provides a real opportunity for Manchester to look at its transport policy across the piece and develop a bold integrated package.</p>
	<p>The budget I am committing today provides the opportunity for a major transport investment package for these areas of Manchester. It is now up to the Manchester authorities to make the most of this opportunity, and to come forward with proposals that will deliver the transport improvements that these areas need.</p>

	<p>On 2 December, the Chancellor announced in his pre-Budget report that we will be looking at a number of ways of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the jobseeker's allowance regime.</p>
	<p>Today I am announcing details of pilot measures and the locations selected to undertake pilot activity from January through to July 2005.</p>
	<p>These measures are intended to speed up entry into employment by improving our understanding of conditionally, increasing commitment to personal job search activity and enabling more effective review of progression.</p>
	<p>Our pilots include:</p>
	<p class="indent">a revised jobseeker's agreement, which we will test in all pilot districts, for completion by the claimant, focussed upon job search steps and including a record of personal job search activity for ongoing review;</p>
	<p class="indent">a revised work focused interview, focusing upon an explanation of conditionality and job matching, based upon the self-completed jobseeker's agreement;</p>
	<p class="indent">a virtual segmentation tool to test whether we can reliably predict the likely speed of individuals gaining employment; and</p>
	<p class="indent">three innovative approaches to the fortnightly job search review; fortnightly telephone contact with random call-in (random call-in means that individuals can be called into the jobcentre for a face to face review of their job search), random call-in for the first three signing events, and random call-in for the first six signing events.</p>
	<p>Pilot activity will be accompanied by a thorough evaluation programme. To test the effectiveness of the new signing regimes we will be applying a random assignment approach which means that about half of all claimants will experience the standard regime.</p>
	<p>Pilot areas are:</p>
	<p>Telephone Signing with Random Call-in</p>
	<p class="indent">Highlands, Islands and Clyde Coast (except Clydebank)</p>
	<p class="indent">The Marches</p>
	<p class="indent">South East London</p>

	<p>We have published today a consultation document Disability Discrimination Bill: Consultation on private clubs; premises; the definition of disability and the questions procedure (Cm 6402). Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p>This document sets out our detailed proposals for using regulation-making powers in the Disability Discrimination Bill, which had its Second Reading in the House of Lords on 6 December, in respect of the Bill's duties on: private clubs; landlords and managers of rented premises; the extension of the definition of disability; and the extension of the questions procedure. The proposals do not vary the main duties, but clarify and define the detail of key concepts which will ensure the main duties can be properly met.</p>
	<p>The main duties in the Bill would:</p>
	<p class="indent">i. bring within scope of Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act (which deals with access to goods, services, facilities and premises) private clubs with 25 or more members;</p>
	<p class="indent">ii. extend the duty of reasonable adjustment, apart from in respect of physical features, to those who let or manage rented premises;</p>
	<p class="indent">iii. extend the definition of disability to people with cancer, HIV and multiple sclerosis effectively from the point of diagnosis; and</p>
	<p class="indent">iv. extend to Part 3 of the DDA a procedure for asking and answering questions about alleged discrimination which is similar to that in Part 2 (which covers employment and occupation) of the Act.</p>
	<p>The consultation document, which is also available in a range of accessible formats, seeks views form interested parties by 18 March 2005. The results will be used in the development of draft regulations and, where appropriate, of Disability Rights Commission statutory codes of practice.</p>
	<p>We committed to consult on measures concerning private clubs when the draft Disability Discrimination Bill was published in December 2003, and on private clubs and the other measures listed above during pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill.</p>
	<p>The consultation document will help to ensure there is full and open debate during the Bill's progress on our plans for using regulation-making powers in the Bill. We have already consulted on using the Bill's regulation-making powers in respect of its duties on public bodies in the consultation document &quot;Delivering Equality for Disabled People&quot;. Copies of that document are available in the Library.</p>
