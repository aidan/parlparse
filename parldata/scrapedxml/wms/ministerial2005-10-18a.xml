	<p pid="a.48WS.2/1">In his Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-07">7 December 2004</phrase>, my predecessor announced our intention to appoint the first chaplains to the Armed Forces from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faith communities. These are the faiths, other than Christian, that are most represented in the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.2/2">Following a national recruitment campaign earlier this year, I am delighted to announce that chaplains from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faith communities have now been appointed. These chaplains will be employed as Ministry of Defence civil servants, but will be fully integrated members of the existing Service Chaplaincy organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.2/3">I am confident that their presence will contribute enormously to encouraging and promoting religious understanding and acceptance within the Armed Forces, and that they will provide comfort, support and valuable advice to individual service personnel who share their faith.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.2/4">Details of the new chaplains will be released both internally and externally once they take up their fall formal duties following completion of a short period of induction and familiarisation training, during which they will learn about the Armed Forces and the work of the Service Chaplaincy organisation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-10-18a.49WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" speakername="Patricia Hewitt" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health" colnum="49WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/wmstext/51018m01.htm#51018m01.html_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/1">National Health Service spending is rising from &pound;33 billion in 1997&ndash;98 to over &pound;90 billion in 2007&ndash;08. This increased investment, together with reform and dedicated work by NHS staff, is transforming our hospitals, with reduced waiting times and lists, improved accident and emergency services and more up-to-date buildings and equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/2">Some 90 per cent., of people's contact with the NHS is in primary care and the challenge now is to improve primary and community services. It is better for patients and taxpayers if long-term conditions like diabetes and heart disease and care for our ageing population&mdash;the big challenges facing the NHS in the 21st century&mdash;are dealt with in the local community, rather than in hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/3">The focus of services needs to shift more towards prevention, moving more services&mdash;like diagnostics, minor operations and other treatments&mdash;out of hospital wherever it is safe and effective to do so, and ensuring all communities get the services they need. We need to continue to reduce administrative costs, releasing further resources for frontline care.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/4">This needs stronger primary care trusts to design, plan and develop better services for patients, to work more closely with local government, and more effectively to hold hospitals and general practitioners (GPs) to account. GPs should also play a more effective role in developing better services for patients and be more accountable to their local communities for spending taxpayers' money. That is why the Government are rolling out &quot;practice-based commissioning&quot;, which will ensure that GPs help deliver better local services for patients. It will also deliver better value for money as GPs help patients avoid going into hospital unnecessarily, and spend the money they save on improving community services, including preventative measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/5">To take this agenda forward in a planned way, with manageable timescales, &quot;Commissioning a Patient-led NHS&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>. Its purpose was to streamline strategic health authorities, strengthen primary care trusts and engage GPs with practice-based commissioning&mdash;all in the cause of improving services to patients. Rather than impose change from the centre, we asked SHAs to submit local proposals for consultation to the Department by <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-15">15 October</phrase>. We asked them to work with local people and stakeholders, including honourable and right honourable members. The proposals have now been received, and are being analysed against the criteria set out by the NHS Chief Executive (Sir Nigel Crisp) on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/6" class="indent">securing high-quality, safe services for patients;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/7" class="indent">improving health and reducing inequalities;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/8" class="indent">improving the engagement of GPs;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/9" class="indent">improving public involvement;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/10" class="indent">improving co-ordination with social services through greater &quot;co-terminosity&quot; of PCT and local government boundaries;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/11" class="indent">effective use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August</phrase>, the Department sent a letter to all SHA chief executives stressing that proposals should consider the context of local health needs, and that different solutions from different SHAs would be encouraged, as long as they were justifiable against the above criteria. He also stressed the need to engage local stakeholders and partner organisations from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/13">An external panel representing key interests has been established to advise Ministers on whether the proposals meet the criteria. The panel is chaired by Michael O'Higgins, managing partner and member of the international board of PA Consulting Group. Members include:</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/14" class="indent">Jane Barrie, Chair of the SHA Chairs;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/15" class="indent">Peter Mount, Chair, NHS Confederation;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/16" class="indent">Joan Saddler, Chair, Waltham Forest PCT;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/17" class="indent">Harry Cayton, national director for patients and the public, Departmentof Health;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/18" class="indent">David Colin-Thome, national director for primary care, Department of Health;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/19" class="indent">Jennifer Dixon, Director of Policy, King's Fund;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/20" class="indent">Liz Fradd, Chief Executive, Nurse Directors' Association;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/21" class="indent">Ara Darzi, Imperial College;</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/22" class="indent">David Henshaw, Chief Executive, Liverpool City Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/23">After this consideration, any proposals for changes to PCT boundaries will then go out for a three month statutory consultation to all local stakeholders and staff interests. This consultation will begin in early December 2005. No decisions on future local configurations will be taken until after this full statutory local consultation has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/24">Changes to SHAs will precede changes to PCTs and any changes to the latter will not commence before April 2006. Any changes to PCTs' role in providing services will take place over a longer timescale and will be subject to consultation in the usual way. Any such changes will build on the results of the forthcoming White Paper on &quot;Community Health and Social Care Services&quot;, based on the current listening exercise, &quot;Your Health, Your Care, Your Say&quot;. Staff will be fully involved in deciding new arrangements and identifying which services will be best for patients. Any staff transferring to a new employer will, of course, be entitled to appropriate legal protection of their terms and conditions of employment. The social partnership forum have decided to set up a working group led by NHS employers to fully engage all trade unions in all workforce issues arising from the commissioning a patient-led NHS change programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.1/25">A chronology of the CPLNHS programme, and a list the relevant key documents, has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.51WS.2/1">This statement sets out my intention to introduce comprehensive measures to protect all workers and the public from the dangers of passive smoking and second-hand smoke in workplaces and in all enclosed public places in Northern Ireland including all pubs and all bars.</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June</phrase> I announced my intention to introduce partial controls throughout Northern Ireland on where people smoke. I also indicated that, over the coming months, I would decide whether to go further and extend controls on where people smoke in all workplaces.</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/3">To help inform my decision I made fact-finding visits to Dublin and New York where controls had already been introduced to assess the benefits to public health and the impact of controls on businesses, especially the hospitality industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/4">The messages from both visits were similar. Both impressed upon me the improvements that have been made to the protection of public health for the general public and employees by controlling where people smoke.</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/5">The Department had already carried out a major consultation exercise between December 2004 and March 2005. This elicited 70,823 responses to questions about strengthening existing controls on tobacco use. 91.18 per cent. of respondents expressed support for comprehensive controls similar to those already in place in the Republic of Ireland. These controls will also be introduced in Scotland next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/6">Trade Unions (with one exception) in Northern Ireland all supported the move to prohibit people from smoking in all workplaces and all enclosed public spaces. In addition organisations such as the Health and Social Services Boards, the BMA, local councils and the voluntary sector have made strong representations to the Department for a complete ban on smoking in all public places and workplaces to protect public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/7">There is strong cross-party support for a complete ban from the majority of MLAs (Alliance, DUP, the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists all registering their support).</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/8">The proposals will be issued for consultation in the New Year.</p>

	<p pid="a.54WS.2/1">I am pleased to announce that on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-09">9 September 2005</phrase>, the Department for Work and Pensions published a consultation document containing draft Occupational Pensions Schemes (Disclosure of Information) regulations 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.54WS.2/2">The draft Regulations introduce a requirement that annual benefit information for non money-purchase benefits is provided automatically. This proposal was originally included in the June 2003 Command Paper &quot;Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement&quot; (Cm 5835).</p>
	<p pid="a.54WS.2/3">The draft Regulations also establish a new approach to disclosure, replacing the rigid timescales of the current disclosure regime with a simple requirement that information be furnished within a reasonable period. These changes reflect recommendations made by Alan Pickering in his report, &quot;A simpler way to better pensions&quot; published in July 2002. The Pensions Regulator is also simultaneously consulting on a corresponding Code of Practice regarding views on what constitutes a reasonable period.</p>
	<p pid="a.54WS.2/4">These Regulations will ensure that scheme members get important automatic information about their non-money purchase pensions, assisting them to make informed choices about the adequacy of their overall retirement provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.54WS.2/5">The consultation period is <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-09">9 September 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">2 December 2005</phrase>. A summary of responses, including the next steps will be published by <phrase class="date" code="">17 February 2006</phrase>.</p>
