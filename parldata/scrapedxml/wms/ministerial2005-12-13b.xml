	<p pid="b.134WS.4/1">In July 2005 I launched a consultation on the creation of a single inspectorate for children and learners. I am today publishing my conclusions in the light of the responses. I am grateful to everyone who responded to the consultation and I have taken careful consideration of the points made, developing my proposals significantly in the light of those comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.134WS.4/2">I intend to proceed, as proposed in the consultation, to establish an enlarged Ofsted. This will be achieved by bringing together in Ofsted the children's social care remit of the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI), the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) inspection remit of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Court Administration (HMICA) and the inspection remit of the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI). The enlarged organisation will have the formal title of the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.134WS.4/3">ALI, CSCI and HMICA have played vital roles in driving up standards in their respective sectors. But I am convinced of the benefits to users and providers of services of an inspectorate that can look across a wide range of services as they affect children, young people, families and adult learners.</p>
	<p pid="b.134WS.4/4">The enlarged Ofsted will be able to follow learning from early years through to adult and work-based settings. It will support the needs of employers and business whilst at the same time sustaining focused, high-quality inspections of standards in our schools and, building on existing activity, across wider services for children, including social care for vulnerable children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.134WS.4/5">The changes also reflect the drive to integrate services around improving outcomes for the user, for example through the integration of local services for children as set out in the Green Paper, &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; and the bringing together of academic and vocational learning outlined in the 14&ndash;19 White Paper. It is part of the wider reform of public service inspection to focus on needs of users, generate improvement in the services inspected, and help deliver better value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.134WS.4/6">Inspection and regulation have been powerful levers for improvement in services for children and learners in recent years. As we move into the next stage of inspection reform it will be essential to build on the strengths of current arrangements and the expertise of existing inspectorates, but also to reflect current and planned changes in the pattern of services, new arrangements for performance management and accountability and our increasing knowledge about what makes for effective inspection and regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.134WS.4/7">The Government will continue to work closely with inspectorates and others to ensure an effective transfer of inspection remits.</p>

	<p pid="b.135WS.1/1">I have today placed copies of the summary of the responses received to the consultation on the school admissions and school admission appeals codes of practice, and supporting regulations, in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.1/2">We consulted on the codes of practice with the intention of having new codes in place from January 2006 for effect from September 2007 admissions onward. The consultation ran from <phrase class="date" code="">26 July</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase>. There has been a wide range of views and some points on which we wish to reflect further, particularly on the respective roles of local authorities, schools, admission forums and the schools adjudicators. Therefore, we have decided not to lay the revised codes at this time. The existing codes of practice will remain in force. We will, however, take forward the regulations on subjects approved for new aptitude selection and giving priority to looked after children in admission arrangements. We remain fully committed to a system of fair admissions for all children.</p>

	<p pid="b.135WS.4/1">I attended and chaired the second Environment Council under the UK Presidency in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase>. I was accompanied by the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, Elliot Morley, in the UK seat.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/2">Council adopted conclusions on the Climate Change Impact of Aviation, by consensus. The Conclusions support the aim of including aviation emissions in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and request that the Commission bring forward a legislative proposal before the end of 2006. The Conclusions also state that a comprehensive and consistent approach to tackling climate change is needed and that existing policies and actions should continue and be strengthened. This outcome is a major achievement and one of our key Presidency priorities on climate change. All Member States were ultimately able to agree on the conclusions, after various textual amendments were made to address specific points made by delegations, particularly in relation to the impact of the inclusion of aviation on industries already covered by the EU ETS and on islands and remote regions within the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/3">The Council reached partial political agreement on the Regulation on the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+), covering all aspects of the dossier except those relating directly to the overall budget, which are dependent on the wider future financing negotiations. The UK Presidency had done a great deal of preparatory work on this dossier at working level, in order to balance the needs of different Member States and to protect funding for biodiversity protection. The main issue outstanding at Council was the apportionment of funding between Member States, and between Member States and the Commission. After a lengthy discussion and a number of further changes to the Presidency's proposed text, the proportion of the budget to be delegated to Member States was increased from 75 per cent. to 80 per cent. to which the Commission agreed, subject to the ultimate size of the budget. The final stages of the negotiation concerned the weighting to be given to population density within the allocation formula, and in particular how to integrate Malta without unduly distorting the calculations. The Netherlands and Belgium were unable to support the partial political agreement following inclusion of this final adjustment, but with all other Member States and the Commission in support the Council was able to adopt the partial political agreement by QMV.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/4">Council also adopted Conclusions in preparation for the International Conference on Chemicals Management to be held in Dubai in February 2006, and scheduled to adopt the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM). The Conclusions confirm the EU's unanimous support for SAICM.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/5">The Commission proposal to approve the placing on the market of a genetically modified maize product, MON 863 x MON 810 was unable to attract a qualified majority either for or against the proposal, and under the agreed procedure for such approvals now returns to the Commission for a final decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/6">There was also an initial Council discussion on next steps on GMOs. A number of delegations were critical of the regulatory process in which the Commission, in the absence of a qualified majority in Council either for or against approval, is subsequently required to authorise GMO products for placing on the market. The Danes, supported by other delegations, called for a further debate which recognising the potential advantages of GMOs for the developing world. The Netherlands indicated that it was satisfied with the existing regulatory system.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/7">Council also held the first debate on the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution and the associated proposal for a new Directive on Ambient Air Quality, which made a valuable contribution to the UK Presidency Better Regulation priority. The Thematic Strategy was broadly welcomed by most Member States. A large majority called for detailed examination of the legislation under consideration by the Commission to deal with source-related pollution at Community level. This included a requirement for Impact Assessments to be carried out on all new proposals and for cost-benefit considerations to be taken into account during negotiations on any new legislation. The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium called for the quick adoption of the Euro 5 and NECD legislation. A number of Member States, including Cyprus and Spain, stressed that the varying geographical factors across the EU had a significant effect on compliance and this should be reflected in the proposed text. There was wide support for the flexibility of the Ambient Air Quality Directive and some discussion of future standards for fine particles, in particular support for these to be non-binding.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/8">At lunch, I updated delegations on progress on REACH, and raised the importance of Ministers going to the Montreal Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Change Convention with sufficient pledges to support the Kyoto mechanisms. Ministers also discussed the forthcoming meetings of the UNEP Governing Council and the Commission on Sustainable Development. We heard a presentation from Professor Jacqueline McGlade of the European Environment Agency on its recently published State and Outlook for the Environment Report 2005. The general reaction was that the report was very useful and demonstrated the benefits of action at EU level in delivering better environmental performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/9">AOB items included information from the Commission on its plans to publish its long-awaited Biodiversity Strategy and from the Presidency on the Nanotechnology Action Plan and on Green Public Procurement. Sweden called for urgent action on the Baltic marine environment, following an informal Ministerial Meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">23 November</phrase>. Belgium raised the subject of the importation of wild birds into the EU and urged the Council to agree to discuss and adopt tough restrictions, were supported by Hungary, Portugal, Germany, Spain and Poland. The Commission agreed to a Presidency request to undertake an option study on the issues involved. Finally, the Dutch made a statement about progress on their Clean, Clever and Competitive initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.135WS.4/10">In conclusion I thanked the Ministers present, the Commission and the Council Secretariat for their constructive approach and support, noting the substantial successes on the environment achieved during the UK Presidency. I passed the traditional green baton to my successor as President for the first half of 2006, the Austrian Minister Josef Proll.</p>

	<p pid="b.137WS.1/1">The eleventh conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change (COP11) and the first Meeting of the parties to the Kyoto protocol (MOP1) took place in Montreal from <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>. Margaret Beckett, UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, led the European Union delegation.</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/2">The agreement reached by all countries participating in the conference represent a important step forward in the global effort to tackle climate change. Despite the deep divisions of recent years, the whole global community including the United States, India and China have agreed to work together through the United Nations process to examine the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/3">The conference agreed:</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/4" class="indent">to implement the Kyoto protocol, by adopt a draft rulebook detailing the operation of the protocol (the Marrakech Accords) and a compliance mechanism for the protocol;</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/5" class="indent">to improve the protocol by providing additional support and improvement to the Clean Development Mechanism;</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/6" class="indent">to establish the Five-Year Adaptation Work Programme, following last year's agreement in Buenos Aires;</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/7" class="indent">to launch processes for fixing new targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions beyond 2012 (when the first commitment period under the Kyoto protocol ends), and for reviewing the functioning of the UN climate change system.</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/8">There will be two tracks to the discussions on global action post-2012:</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/9" class="indent">developed country Kyoto signatories will consider further targets beyond 2012, when the first commitment period under the Kyoto protocol ends; and</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/10" class="indent">all countries under the UNFCCC (including Kyoto parties plus non-signatories including the US and Australia) have agreed to begin talks on the longer term future, analysing strategic approaches for long-term cooperative action. This includes advancing development goals in a sustainable way, addressing action on adaptation, realising the full potential of technology, and making full use of the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/11">The UK's leadership on climate change has played an important role in enabling this agreement, through our action at home and abroad, in particular in 2005. The Prime Minister's decision to make climate change a top priority for the UK's presidencies of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised nations in 2005 and the European Union from <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase> is recognised by all parties as an important factor that has injected fresh momentum into the international debate. The entry into force of the Kyoto protocol this year was another important boost to global discussion on climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/12">The outcome of the G8 Summit at Gleneagles in July, attended also by leaders from China, India and other large developing countries, was a milestone. Key world leaders agreed for the first time that climate change was exacerbated by man's emission of greenhouse gases and required a rapid response. The G8 agreed to a new G8+ Dialogue on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development to create a political space outside the formal negotiating process and to complement and reinforce the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process.</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/13">By implementing a series of innovative policy measures at home, the UK is one of the few countries on track to meet its Kyoto target, a reduction in emissions of a basket of greenhouse gases of 12.5 per cent. from 1990 levels by 2012. And the UK has shown international leadership by setting an even more challenging domestic goal to reduce emissions by 20 per cent., to which we remain committed and are addressing through the climate change programme review.</p>
	<p pid="b.137WS.1/14">The UK recognises that the agreement reached at Montreal is only the beginning of a further round of global discussion. We remain committed to achieving the stabilisation of GHGs in the atmosphere in line with the goal of the UN Climate Change Convention.</p>

	<p pid="b.139WS.2/4">We have now confirmed that a total of 149 British nationals died as a result of the Tsunami; 129 in Thailand, 17 in Sri Lanka and three in the Maldives. The bodies of 143 of these people have been identified. The bodies of the remaining six have not yet been identified. There is one British national whose death has not been confirmed and who is still listed as a category one missing person&mdash;that is highly likely to have been caught up in the Tsunami.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/5" class="italic">Anniversary arrangements</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/6">On the morning of <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase>, the Royal Thai Government is arranging events in six separate locations where the greatest loss of life occurred. One memorial event will be held on Phi Phi Island; two in the Khao Lak area; and three in the Phuket area. A memorial foundation stone laying ceremony will take place in Khao Lak on the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase>, followed in the evening by an inter-faith service. Both of these events will be attended by the Prime Minister of Thailand. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs with responsibility for consular affairs, Lord Triesman, will represent the Government at the anniversary events.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/7">We expect that around 130 British nationals will travel to Thailand for the anniversary. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's priority will be to provide support for families of the British victims during this very difficult time. As part of the special package of assistance which I agreed for victims of the Tsunami, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will cover the travel and accommodation costs of a number of British nationals travelling to Thailand to mark this anniversary. Some of those families who have already taken advantage of this package of assistance and some of those injured will have their travel and accommodation provided for by the Royal Thai Government. A few families have chosen to travel independently, and will make their own arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/8">The families of all British victims will be met at Bangkok airport and at Phuket airport and given assistance with travel to official commemorative events on <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase>. If they wish, officials from the Government and the British Red Cross will accompany them during their visit. My noble Friend, Lord Triesman, with the British Ambassador David Fall, will attend a religious service and host a reception in Phuket on <phrase class="date" code="">24 December</phrase> for the families and for survivors.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/9">In Sri Lanka, many communities and religious groups along the coast will hold events to mark the anniversary of the Tsunami. The Sri Lankan authorities are not planning to hold a large-scale commemoration ceremony but they are organising an inter-faith service on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase> in the town of Bentota, on the south-west coast. We expect that 15 British nationals will travel out to Sri Lanka for the anniversary. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will cover the accommodation and travel costs of some of those going out through the special package of assistance. Others are travelling independently. The Sri Lankan Government will also mark the anniversary with a remembrance service held on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase> at their High Commission in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/10">The Maldives Government are not planning to commemorate the anniversary as the whole of this year has been declared a year of national unity to mark the Tsunami. We are not expecting any British nationals to travel there for the anniversary itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/11">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell), has recently visited India, Thailand and Sri Lanka to thank all the staff and volunteers for their work in the aftermath of the Tsunami. In Thailand she discussed arrangements for the forthcoming anniversary commemoration with the Thai Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/12">The Government deeply appreciate the tremendous support and kindness shown by the governments and the peoples of all the countries in which British people were killed. At a time when they were each overwhelmed by their own national tragedies, they have shown enormous compassion and generosity to the nationals of other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/13" class="italic">Ongoing Government response</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/14">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to provide support and assistance to British nationals affected by the Tsunami. The United Kingdom has a dedicated consular team in Phuket for this purpose. We have also encouraged the British Red Cross to use some of the money which was donated by the public for Tsunami relief to assist British families who are suffering financial hardship. The Fund will primarily be available to UK residents, and grants will be made available to individuals who have been seriously affected by the Tsunami whether through bereavement, injury or trauma. Funds are also available for those otherwise unable to afford travel to events such as the formal inquest in West London. Payments from the Fund will normally be single grants of up to &pound;10,000 per individual in respect of financial hardship and up to &pound;2,000 for those requiring private psychological treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/15">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has taken over the running of the Red Cross Helpline which had been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This helpline offers support and telephone counselling to all victims of the Tsunami and provides advice on, for example, how victims can get long-term psychological help or on how to access the benefits system. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is also funding the Red Cross Tsunami Support Network which was set up by the Red Cross and was also initially funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/16">Police Family Liaison Officers got back in touch with all the families of the victims in the run up to the formal inquest into the majority of the British deaths last week. Three British police officers are still seconded to the international disaster victim identification team in Thailand and are expected to remain there until the end of February.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/17">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is continuing to improve its crisis management procedures in the light of the recently published joint report by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the National Audit Office on lessons learned from our response to the Tsunami. The report concludes that Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff in the region and in London &quot;coped tremendously well under severe pressure&quot; and that they had &quot;worked extremely long hours and made great personal sacrifices&quot;. But the unprecedented scale of the Tsunami meant that some people did not get the level of support which we would have wanted to give them. Where that happened, I have apologised to the families affected and we have listened to their suggestions for how we could have done better.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/18">The joint report includes detailed recommendations on how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office can further improve its emergency response. We have accepted those recommendations in full; we have already implemented some and others are in hand. So, for example, although we had put in place new arrangements with the police for handling calls in the wake of the terrorist attacks of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, the police call centre could not cope with the volume of traffic generated by the Tsunami&mdash;at times more than 10,000 calls an hour. We are now part of new police call handling arrangements which route emergency calls across their national network; and we are looking at a way to register missing people on-line, taking some of the load off people staffing the telephones.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/19">I was and remain determined to learn lessons so that our consular crisis management, an area in which the National Audit Office recognised the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as &quot;world leaders&quot;, is the very best it can be.</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/20" class="italic">Support for countries affected by the Tsunami</p>
	<p pid="b.139WS.2/21">The Government have allocated the equivalent of around &pound;275 million to disaster relief and reconstruction in the Tsunami affected countries including the Indonesian province of Aceh which took the brunt of the Tsunami. This can be broken down into: &pound;75 million of bilateral funds allocated to the humanitarian relief effort; &pound;65 million of bilateral funds to the longer-term reconstruction phase; &pound;50 million through tax relief on public donations made through the Gift Aid Scheme; &pound;40 million contributed through the European Union; and &pound;45 million by adding Sri Lanka to the list of countries eligible for the United Kingdom's new multilateral debt relief initiative.</p>

	Greater Western and Thameslink Rail Franchises
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-12-13b.142WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1981" speakername="Alistair Darling" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="142WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051213/wmstext/51213m03.htm#51213m03.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/1">I am announcing today that First Group has been awarded contracts to run the Greater Western and Thameslink/GN (Great Northern) franchises. Both contracts will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/2">The contracts have been awarded following a rigorous, competitive and independent bidding process. Both are tough and will deliver value for money for the taxpayer and an improved service for passengers.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/3">The contract my Department has signed for the Greater Western franchise commits First Group to operate the services from London to the South West and South Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/4">Many of the concerns raised following my Department's consultation on the Invitation to Tender on the Franchise have been addressed. In particular it commits First Group to retain the overnight sleeper between London and Penzance and retains the half hourly off peak service between London and Cardiff.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/5">In excess of &pound;200 million of private sector investment will be made within the early years of the franchise. This will contribute towards a complete re-design of the high speed fleet. Together with the new timetable this will increase the number of standard class seats on trains between London and Reading in the morning and evening peak periods by more than 20 per cent. and 30 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/6">It will also fund a programme of station enhancements, including better customer information systems, passenger security measures including CCTV and 1,700 new car parking spaces. Additional revenue protection staff and community support officers will also be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/7">The contract is for 10 years, with the final three years dependent on achieving tough service performance targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/8">On the Thameslink/GN franchise First Group has been contracted to run services from Brighton, through London and on to Bedford, and from London to Cambridge and Peterborough.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/9">The timing and capacity of services to Bedford will be improved. Over &pound;40 million of private sector investment will be made in the first three years. This will help improve the reliability and quality of the rolling stock, enhance stations and provide 600 additional car parking spaces.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/10">The franchise is for up to nine years. At the end of the fourth year the franchise will automatically continue for two years if performance improvement targets are met. Subject to my Department's agreement the franchise can then continue for up to three further years. This flexibility is necessary to facilitate work on the Thameslink 2000 Programme which was subject to a public inquiry under the Transport and Works Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.142WS.2/11">On both franchises First Group expects to deliver continuous improvement in service performance. In addition, it is contracted to provide premiums of &pound;1,131 million for the Greater Western Franchise and &pound;808 million for the Thameslink/GN franchise. This is funding that will be put to good use and reinvested back into the railways to help ensure rail services continue to improve.</p>

	<p pid="b.143WS.1/1">I am today making an additional &pound;100 million available for the further development of Crossrail. This money will be used by Cross London Rail Links (CLRL)&mdash;the company held jointly by the Department and TfL to assist them with promotion of the Crossrail Bill&mdash;to provide proper support to the project as we take the Crossrail hybrid Bill through Parliament over this period. It will also allow CLRL, working with the Department and TfL, to do necessary research and planning before the Crossrail scheme can enter its next phase of development.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.1/2">The case for Crossrail is clear and the Government have long said that they are committed to the scheme. This is a further sign of that commitment. This is a complex long-term project but important features are being determined at this stage. Money spent properly now will see its reward later in a better planned, better designed and therefore better value for money final scheme. But that does not mean that resource is unlimited. The grants I am announcing today will allow CLRL to make a start on a detailed programme of work for the development of Crossrail. My Department will continue to monitor expenditure on the project, so as to ensure best value as the Bill continues through Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.1/3">These grants will be paid to CLRL by my Department under section 6 of the Railways Act 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.143WS.4/1">The Employment and Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on 8 and <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase> in Brussels. Employment and social policy issues were taken on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase>. Health and Consumer Affairs were taken on the <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>. The Council was chaired by my right hon. Friend Secretary of State for Work and Pensions apart from the agenda item on the working time directive which was chaired by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I represented the UK seat apart from the working time directive agenda item when my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry took that role.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.4/2">The first item was a presidency report from the informal meeting of Heads of State and Government, Hampton Court, <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>. The presidency recalled that Hampton Court, in endorsing the Commission's paper on &quot;European Values in the Globalised World&quot;, had agreed a coherent framework for future thinking on social justice, globalisation and demography. The Employment and Social Policy Council would take the lead on following up work on demographic change.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.4/3">A policy debate on &quot;Demography and Human Capital&quot; revealed a high degree of consensus on the broad approach. Discussions covered labour market participation, the need to extend working lives, reconciling work and family life, increasing momentum towards gender equality in access to employment, regulated immigration mitigating effects of demographic change and free movement within the EU being achieved before third country immigration. The Commission agreed that all the areas identified by Member States were important, and must be coordinated into a coherent overall strategy. The presidency concluded that Council would return to this issue during discussions on the joint implementation report in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.4/4">The Chairman of the Employment Committee (EMCO) outlined the key conclusions from the Examination of national reform programmes. These are the annual reports on each member state's progress towards achieving the Lisbon goals which outline their focused policy objectives. The Council noted EMCO's report, and the presidency concluded that EMCO's findings would be useful to the Commission in its preparation of the joint implementation report, and in preparations for the spring Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.4/5">Council reached agreement on two dossiers: a partial political agreement on a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity&mdash;(PROGRESS) which involved agreement on all parts of the programme without budgetary implications; and, political agreement on a common position on the gender recast directive which aims to simplify, modernise and improve existing EU law on equal treatment between men and women. The presidency advised that the European Parliament had confirmed its undertaking not to adopt any amendments in second reading if the Council adopted the common position on the basis of the text negotiated in the informal discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.4/6">The Commissioner introduced the proposed directive on portability of occupational pensions, which seeks to facilitate the acquisition, transfer and protection of occupational pension rights, with the aim of reducing barriers to worker mobility. The presidency gave some feedback from exchanges in Council working groups: a number of issues would need to be addressed before the dossier was ready to be discussed at ministerial level.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.4/7">There was a lengthy debate on the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time; the presidency prepared revised texts for discussion and the Council almost reached agreement on a package which retained the opt out and solved the doctors' on call issue. However, despite intense negotiation, concerns about clarifying that the limits in the directive applying per worker rather than per job/contract meant this agreement could not finally be reached. The presidency agreed to reflect on the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.143WS.4/8">Under &quot;Any Other Business&quot;, the Council noted reports from the presidency on the 10-year anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action&mdash;which reviews annually gender equality issues, and presidency conferences on health and safety, corporate social responsibility, and social inclusion. Council also noted a report from Luxembourg on the four European meeting of persons in a situation of poverty, and two information items from the Commission, on the biennial report on disability, and on a memorandum of understanding between the Commission and China on employment and social affairs.</p>
