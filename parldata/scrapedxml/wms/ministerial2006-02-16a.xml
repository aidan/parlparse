<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-02-16a.114WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government" colnum="114WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/wmstext/60216m01.htm#60216m01.html_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.114WS.2/1">In July 2005 I announced the indicative allocation of &pound;525 million Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) resources for 2006&ndash;07 to 86 local authority districts. These allocations were subject to satisfactory progress by Local Strategic Partnerships. I can now confirm the final allocations for all 86 LSPs in receipt of NRF for the period 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="a.114WS.2/2">As I said when we announced the allocation of the NRF last July we are committed to improving the overall quality of life for people living in our most disadvantaged areas. We want them to share fully in a better society where we see respect for people of all ages, races and faiths and respect for the communities they live in. The funds are to support local authorities, other agencies and communities to work together to achieve these goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.114WS.2/3">Ministers have made it clear that the initial allocations were conditional on satisfactory assessment of progress in the autumn. Those LSPs assessed as weak at that time were then required to put in place a robust improvement plan and demonstrate they had the capacity to deliver it by <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.114WS.2/4">Overall Local Strategic Partnerships in these areas have made good progress in achieving neighbourhood renewal objectives since they started in 2001. There is evidence that progress has been made in reducing crime and worklessness and improving health, education and housing. However a small number of these areas&mdash; three&mdash;need to improve their performance. The Government are to withhold 10 per cent. of the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund allocation for the financial year 2006&ndash;07 from these three LSPs. The three LSPs (local authorities and their partners) and the amounts withheld are:</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.114WS.2/15">Each of these LSPs will be required to complete plans to demonstrate how national floor targets are to be met and the gap narrowed between the poorest neighbourhoods and the city average. If these LSPs are able to demonstrate significant improvement by the end of April 2006, the funds withheld will be released during 2006&ndash;07.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-02-16a.116WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="116WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/wmstext/60216m01.htm#60216m01.html_spmin5">
	<p pid="a.116WS.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase> I announced that the Government had decided to introduce an Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS) for the private security industry and that the detail of the scheme, including the fee structure, would be announced at a later date. The purpose of the scheme is to protect the public and to maintain and improve standards within the private security industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.5/2">The detail of the ACS has now been decided. It will have the following key features:</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.5/3">The scheme will have three broad alternative routes to accreditation, relating to a combination of Options 3 and 4 set out in the draft Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-25">25 August 2005</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.5/4" class="indent">(a) Self assessment against an Security Industry Authority (SIA)-provided workbook followed by verification from an SIA-approved assessing body;</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.5/5" class="indent">(b) Confirmation of ISO9001:2000 certification by a UKAS-accredited body combined with British Standards compliance, topped up with those elements of the SIA Self Assessment Workbook in (a) not already covered;</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.5/6" class="indent">(c) Use of an existing SIA approved accreditation, based on existing standards, to meet the same requirement as (a).</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.5/7">Companies approved under the scheme will be permitted to deploy up to 15 per cent. of their security personnel who are not yet licensed but who have completed training and have an application pending. I have already announced that they will not be able to deploy unlicensed personnel on assignments that involve contact with children or vulnerable adults. This will ensure that those dealing with this particularly sensitive group have undergone, and satisfied any SIA requirements relating to, a Criminal Records Bureau check.</p>

	<p pid="a.123WS.1/1">I am today launching a full public consultation on the release of data from the DVLA and DVLNI vehicle registers. I have placed copies in the House Library and it is also available on the DfT website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.123WS.1/2">The Government take very seriously their responsibilities for protecting individuals' legitimate expectations of privacy and confidentiality. Information collected from citizens is therefore held securely and will only be released to third parties where there is a lawful basis for doing so. There is a broad consensus that some groups&mdash;such as the police&mdash;should have full access to details from the vehicle register. Over the past 40 years, a wide range of other groups have been granted access to details held on the register for what is judged to be &quot;reasonable cause&quot;. However, the activities of a small number of groups who have been granted access has raised significant concern. And so we are today setting out how the current system operates, and the main options for the future. Consultation will last six weeks and we look forward to receiving responses by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.123WS.1/3">Specifically, the consultation seeks views on the groups that should have information from the vehicle register and the reasons for their having it; how we manage access to the register; and the audit regime for those who are granted access.</p>
	<p pid="a.123WS.1/4">Following the consultation we will announce any changes that are to be made and if necessary, amend legislation accordingly. We intend to ensure that this current review produces a system that protects vehicle keepers from misuse of their information; ensures that those who do have a good case can get the data they need; balances the right to privacy of individuals whose data are held on the register with the rights of others to gain proper redress; is cost effective&mdash;in that the costs to all are proportionate to the benefits that the scheme delivers; and is right in principle and works in practice.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-02-16a.125WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" speakeroffice="The Minister for Pensions Reform" colnum="125WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060216/wmstext/60216m04.htm#60216m04.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.125WS.1/1">The general notification period for the Financial Assistance Scheme ends on the <phrase class="date" code="">28 February</phrase>. The notification period began on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September</phrase> and is the period during which the scheme manager must be supplied with some basic details of potentially eligible pension schemes in order for them to be considered for qualification. The scheme manager may, at his discretion, accept notification of those details for any particular scheme after the <phrase class="date" code="">28 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.125WS.1/2">Although FAS offers help to those pension schemes which began winding-up between <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase> where the principal employer became insolvent on or before <phrase class="date" code="">28 February</phrase>, extending the notification period for any particular scheme also extends the period in which an insolvency event can occur. This means it may be possible for some pension schemes which would not otherwise qualify for FAS or for compensation offered under the Pension Protection Fund to become qualifying schemes for FAS. I wish to make it clear that we may be able to extend help to some individual pension scheme members who have lost part or all of their occupational pensions but who may not have appeared eligible for help from either FAS or the PPF.</p>
	<p pid="a.125WS.1/3">The Government will set a definitive cut-off date for insolvency events before the end of the calendar year. Until then the scheme manager will consider requests for an extension to the notification period from those pension schemes that undergo a qualifying insolvency event after the <phrase class="date" code="">28 February</phrase>.</p>
