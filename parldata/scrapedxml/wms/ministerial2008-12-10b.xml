<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-12-10b.53WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="53WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm081210/wmstext/81210m0001.htm#08121029000128">
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/1">In July of this year, I published a discussion paper entitled &quot;Ensuring UK Food Security in a Changing World&quot;. I wanted to start a debate on the long-term challenges to our food security such as climate change, increased demand&mdash;particularly for some foods&mdash;and the energy dependence of our food supply. I also wanted to assess the impact of shorter term issues, including export bans and rises in commodity prices, that are in part a consequence of these same challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/2">Annual food price inflation has now decreased from a peak of 14.5 per cent. in August 2008 to 11.2 per cent. in November. We expect it to continue to decline over the coming months, reflecting the falls we have seen in oil and commodity prices. The UK feed wheat price currently stands at &pound;88 per tonne, less than half the peak of &pound;185 back in March. Pig prices have edged down over recent weeks, where the change in the value of sterling continues to offset the impact of declining wider EU market prices, whilst cattle and sheep prices have remained relatively level. The average farm gate milk price in September&mdash;the latest month for which figures are available&mdash;was 27 per litre, 17 per cent. higher than a year earlier, but we have seen price falls in many dairy commodity markets over recent months. The proportion of income spent on food by the UK's poorest 20 per cent. went up from 15.5 per cent. to 16.5 per cent. at the peak of food price inflation and is not likely to have changed substantially since July. We are doing further work to see what this has meant for food purchasing decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/3">We received over 100 written responses to July's paper and held three workshops. It was clear that many people, from producers to retailers and consumers, feel strongly about agriculture and food. A wide range of views were expressed ranging from support for intensive farming to calls for a radical rethinking about the relationship between traditional agricultural inputs and the food we produce. Issues raised included landscapes, water, food distribution, agricultural research, nutrition, and skills in farming and food sciences.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/4">Many of those responding agreed that we should not base our food security policy on the pursuit of self-sufficiency, and the debate has shifted to a broader discussion of the complex factors that contribute to our food security. Twenty six countries&mdash;including our own&mdash;provide 90 per cent. of our food consumption, with the majority coming from other EU countries. In addition, inputs to food production such as oil, fertiliser and feed, are globally traded commodities. Trade with developing countries is also important, and respondents agreed that the Government needed to continue to pursue both radical CAP reform, and an agreement from the current Doha trade round. Nonetheless, UK production does&mdash;and will in the future&mdash;provide an important contribution to our food supply, which varies widely across sectors, from 10 per cent. in fruit, to over 100 per cent. in cereals.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/5">As a result of all the comments we have had on our discussion paper, it seems clear that food security is most usefully looked at in terms of the resilience of our food supply chains, access to safe, nutritious, affordable and diverse foods, and ensuring the long-term environmental sustainability of the food and farming sector. Our agri-food sector, from farm gate to retail is hugely important. It is worth &pound;79 billion and employs 3.7 million people.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/6">I am today announcing that the membership of The Council of Food Policy Advisers, which I have established to support our work on food security, affordability and sustainability, under the Chairmanship of Dame Suzi Leather, will be:</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/7" class="indent">Sir Don Curry</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/8" class="indent">Sue Davies, MBE</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/9" class="indent">Professor Elizabeth Dowler</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/10" class="indent">Professor Gareth Edwards-Jones</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/11" class="indent">lain Ferguson, CBE</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/12" class="indent">Paul Kelly</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/13" class="indent">Professor Tim Lang</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/14" class="indent">Guy McCracken</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/15" class="indent">Claire Pritchard</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/16" class="indent">Dame Fiona Reynolds</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/17" class="indent">Geetie Singh</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/18" class="indent">Tim Smith</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/19" class="indent">Stefan Tangermann</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/20">Additional members will be announced later.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/21">I will ask the council to advise on what may be necessary in future to ensure that we have a secure and sustainable food system in the UK. I will also invite the council to examine the draft indicators for food security that DEFRA has been developing in the light of the responses we have had. We will continue to work with stakeholders as we develop these and consider broader risks to our food security.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/22">The UK's food security is strongly linked to global food security. The Foresight project on the future of food and farming, conducted by the Government's chief scientific adviser, Professor John Beddington's, is looking to 2050 and examining how we will feed a global population of 9 billion healthily, equitably, and sustainable, and what implications this has for UK policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/23">Part of the answer lies in promoting environmentally sustainable agriculture throughout the world. The Government will continue to support this, drawing on domestic and international research and expertise including this year's International agricultural assessment headed by Professor Bob Watson, DEFRA's chief scientific adviser.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/24">In addition, the Government will continue to press for the establishment of a Global Partnership For Agriculture And Food Security (GPAFS). GPAFS will bring together Governments, international institutions and civil society to help develop national and international plans for agriculture, food security and nutrition and support increased sustainable agricultural production.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/25">I also welcome the EFRA Select Committee's announcement that they will be holding an inquiry into the strengths and weaknesses of the UK food system, and the opportunities and challenges the country faces in responding to the global demand for increased food production. DEFRA looks forward to submitting evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.53WS.5/26">The Government are committed to ensuring sustainable food security in the face of climate change and a rapidly increasing global population. To do so will require leadership in the UK, co-operation with other countries and a transformation in our international institutions. I will update the House as this work develops.</p>

	<p pid="b.56WS.2/1">I represented the UK at Education Council, on behalf of DIUS and DCSF.</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/2" class="italic">Summary</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/3">The council adopted resolutions on multilingualism and on lifelong guidance. The Council also agreed conclusions on co-operation on schools; vocational education and training; and youth mobility. The texts of all the dossiers adopted are in line with UK national priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/4" class="italic">Council</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/5">A resolution was adopted on multilingualism which recognises the value of multilingualism both in terms of personal development and to the economy. The UK agrees with these overall goals, but has worked to ensure that the definition of multilingualism is as wide as possible, including world languages and less widely used European languages.</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/6">Ministers agreed conclusions on enhanced co-operation in vocational education and training.</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/7">These conclusions form the latest review of the Copenhagen process which was designed to improve European co-operation on vocational education and training. Commissioner Figel noted that their communication &quot;New Skills for New Jobs&quot;, to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-16">16 December</phrase>, would have a key role to play in linking vocational education and training to the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/8">A resolution was adopted on guidance in lifelong learning. This resolution aims to strengthen the role of guidance within countries' national lifelong learning strategies and to strengthen European co-operation in this field. A ministerial debate flagged the wide range of approaches underway in different countries. I highlighted the new Apprenticeships Bill and the adult advancement and careers service as examples of the work the UK is doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/9">Ministers adopted conclusions on European co-operation on schools, which propose areas of focus for future co-operation at a European level on schools through the open method of co-ordination. The conclusions acknowledge that the responsibility for organising school systems and education policy lies entirely with member states. All who spoke welcomed the text and agreed that, although this was an area of member state competence, the EU had a useful co-ordination role in helping countries to meet their 2010 goals in education and training under the Lisbon strategy. By the end of this year, the commission would also publish their draft priorities in the area of education and training for the period up to 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/10">Ministers adopted conclusions on youth mobility, which seek to increase the numbers of young people spending a period of time abroad through undertaking part of their studies participating in EU mobility programmes. Ministers discussed the importance of mobility both for the development of individuals and also for the labour market. I highlighted our increasing numbers of Erasmus participants, the aim to widen participation to less advantaged groups, and the increased language learning among teachers.</p>
	<p pid="b.56WS.2/11">The presidency presented updates on the adoption of a new credit system in vocational training, quality assurance in vocational training, and the next phase of the Erasmus Mundus programme. The Commission presented information on the Europa diary; learning to learn; collaborative working with India and Israel; and on the Euroskills event held in Rotterdam in September. Portugal and Poland announced their bids to host the 2010 Euroskills event. I welcomed the Rotterdam event and noted that we would host Worldskills in London in 2011. The Czech Minister presented the Czech Republic's presidency priorities in the field of education. These comprised the future strategy in education and training post-2010; encouraging partnerships between education and employers; and pressing for progress in higher education via the Bologna process.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-12-10b.59WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice" colnum="59WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm081210/wmstext/81210m0002.htm#08121029000132">
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/1">The Government's response to the report by Baroness Corston of &quot;A Review of Women with Particular Vulnerabilities in the Criminal Justice System&quot; (Cm 7261) was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December 2007</phrase>. This was followed by a written ministerial statement and a progress report I issued on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-24">24 June 2008</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-06-24.7"><i>Official Report</i>, Col. 7WS</phrase>) outlining developments made over the last six months.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/2">A year on since the Government's response was published; I am today updating Parliament and publishing a report on significant progress made since June 2008, detailing our continued commitment to bring about real improvements for women offenders. I have placed copies of the progress report in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/3">My new role as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Government Equalities Office alongside my continued role with the Ministry of Justice has created further synergies to strengthen the cross-Government joint working that is fundamental to the success of this agenda. I am pleased to report on the significant actions which we have been able to deliver against the commitments made in the Government's response and the wider work we are undertaking to take this agenda further forward beyond the Corston commitments:</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/4" class="indent">The Ministry of Justice is committed to providing additional resourcing in the new year to divert vulnerable women who are not serious or dangerous offenders from custody. We plan to reduce the number of women in prison and to provide additional services in the community for women offenders and women at risk of offending. The resources will be used to build capacity of one-stop shop services and to develop further bail support services better to meet the needs of women. Baroness Corston was convinced that one-stop shop services delivered through women's centres provide the radical new women-centred approach her review called for. The Ministry of Justice has been working with regional offender managers&mdash;and directors of offender management&mdash;as well as the Griffins Society to map existing provision and develop a picture of where there is potential to develop capacity. It is proposed to invest in existing third sector providers to enable them to work with courts, police, probation and other statutory agencies to provide support and services to vulnerable women in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/5" class="indent">Pilots on a conditional caution specifically for women developed in joint co-operation between the Government, local police, prosecutors and &quot;Together Women&quot; centres&mdash;presenting a chance for diversion at an early stage&mdash;were launched in September 2008. The pilots are running in Leeds, Bradford, Keighley and Liverpool for a period of six months and early indications are positive. The condition attached to the caution commits the woman to attend a &quot;Together Women&quot; centre for a full needs assessment, providing them with an opportunity to address the causes of their offending.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/6" class="indent">Following successful pilots, using the new model women's full search, the National Offender Management Service is now implementing the introduction of the new arrangements for full searching&mdash;as set out in Prison Service Instruction 38/2008&mdash;in all women's prisons. The new arrangements do not require the removal of underwear unless there is intelligence or suspicion at any stage that an item is concealed. To date this has taken place at HMP Downview, HMP Send, HMP Morton Hall, HMP Styal, HMP East Sutton Park, HMP Peterborough, HMP Bronzefield and HMP New Hall. All women's prisons will be on stream by <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/7" class="indent">In October 2008 a probation circular providing guidance for greater use of female approved premises was issued. This encourages greater use of capacity in female premises by introducing flexibility into the admissions criteria to include women who may not necessarily present a high risk of harm to others. Such women could also benefit from the supervised, structured and supportive environment available. We are expecting to see an increase in numbers of women accessing them in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/8" class="indent">In July 2008 the independent Sentencing Advisory Panel published its consultation paper on the overarching principles of sentencing. The panel was asked by the Sentencing Guidelines Council to review the definitive guidelines &quot;Overarching Principles: Seriousness and New Sentences: Criminal Justice Act 2003&quot;. The consultation paper contains an important discussion of the principles of sentencing of women offenders. Further work needs to be done to understand current sentencing practice but we welcome the steps the panel has taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/9" class="indent">Lord Bradley's review into the diversion of offenders with mental health problems or learning disabilities is due to report to Government early in the new year. The review considers women offenders and the ongoing programme of work from the Corston report has formed part of the evidence Lord Bradley is considering. The Government welcome Lord Bradley's review and accepted recommendations will be taken forward in the offender health and social care strategy, currently being developed by Government for publication in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.1/10" class="indent">The cross-departmental criminal justice women's strategy unit now includes representatives from the Attorney-General's Office, Government Equalities Office and the Department of Health, and we are continuing to negotiate with other Departments to contribute resources. The unit informs the work of the ministerial sub-group on implementation of the Government's response to Corston; which has recently expanded its membership to include Ministers from both the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>
