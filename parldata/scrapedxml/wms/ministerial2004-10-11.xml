	<p pid=".3WS.3/1">In my written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-02-25.46"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 46&ndash;49WS</phrase>, on countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), I expressed the hope that the UN Security Council would adopt a tough resolution against WMD proliferation, and establish an appropriate follow-up mechanism to oversee its implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.3/2">Both of these aims have now been achieved. UN Security Council Resolution 1540 (UNSCR1540) was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-28">28 April</phrase> this year. The resolution called on states to adopt robust national legislation to criminalise the possession, manufacture or trafficking of WMD, and their means of delivery, in particular for terrorist purposes; to develop appropriate, effective export controls on WMD related materials where these do not exist; and to maintain effective physical protection of such materials.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.3/3">UNSCR1540 also established a committee (the 1540 Committee) to oversee its implementation, and called on all states to report on their implementation of the resolution by <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-28">28 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.3/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-29">29 September</phrase> the UK submitted to the Security Council its report on implementation of UNSCR1540. The UK's report under 1540 has been agreed interdepartmentally, and endorsed by the cross-Whitehall Counter-Proliferation Implementation Committee (CPIC).</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.3/5">We are one of the first states to submit its report to the 1540 Committee, underlining our commitment to UNSCR1540 and to counter-proliferation. I hope that the UK report will help set the standard for other states to follow, both in terms of structure and detail of the report itself, as well as in terms of concrete action to prevent the proliferation of WMD.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.3/6">However, we will not rest on our laurels. The UK is continuing to review domestic implementation, as well as look at new initiatives to counter the proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery.</p>

	<p pid=".4WS.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-17">17 June 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-06-17.48"><i>Official Report</i>, column 48WS</phrase>, I informed the House that I expected the European Commission to take a decision on the Government's proposed restructuring aid to British Energy in the autumn. I am pleased to say that on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-22">22 September</phrase>, the commission approved that aid.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/2">This is a very significant milestone in the implementation of British Energy's restructuring plan. We have said from the outset that our aid complied with the commission's rules and this approval confirms that.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/3">It is usual in restructuring aid cases for the commission to require the recipient of the aid to implement certain compensatory measures. In this case, the Commission's approval is subject to the following compensatory measures, which are stringent but workable:</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/4" class="indent">The company's nuclear generation business will be ring-fenced from its fossil fuel, supply and trading businesses to ensure the aid to the nuclear business is not used to cross subsidise any other of the company's businesses. This measure will last indefinitely. It is likely that this will be enforced through an undertaking between the DTI and British Energy although we have also discussed with OfGEM, the gas and electricity markets regulator, how this could best be enforced.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/5" class="indent">No nuclear or fossil-fuelled capacity expansion (above British Energy's current capacity) by the company in the European economic area for six years, and no hydro-electric capacity expansion in the UK for the same period. This will be enforced through an undertaking between the DTI and British Energy.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/6" class="indent">A restriction on the company selling to its industrial and commercial customers at prices below the prevailing wholesale market price for six years unless there are exceptional market circumstances as determined by an independent expert. This will be monitored by that expert and enforced by the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/7">In addition, the Commission has required the UK Government to provide more detailed reporting if payments in respect of British Energy's decommissioning and uncontracted liabilities and any incremental historic spent fuel liabilities exceed &pound;1.629 billion. This enhanced reporting is so the Commission can satisfy themselves that the aid is being kept to a minimum and is only being used for authorised purposes. &pound;1.629 billion is the net present value of the total of these liabilities as at December 2002, calculated using the Commission's discount rate of 5.4 per cent. nominal. Owing to the very long timescale over which these liabilities will be discharged, they are the most uncertain in terms of their value. The &pound;1.629 billion does not include the aid we are giving in respect of British Energy's historic spent fuel costs valued by the commission at &pound;2.185 billion, which are fixed, except for inflation. The estimate of the cost to Government (&pound;150 million&mdash;&pound;200 million a year on average for the next 10 years falling thereafter) given in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">28 November 2002</phrase>, remains unchanged.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/8">Both to minimise Government's contribution and financial exposure to the company's liabilities, a number of measures have been put in place in the restructuring agreements. In particular, British Energy will contribute 65 per cent. of its annual free cash flow towards discharging its liabilities and, if there are material increases in British Energy's liabilities, the nuclear decommissioning authority will determine if the additional cost should fall to the company or to Government. British Energy's creditors have taken similar measures to protect their own exposures. Subject to these measures, many of which only apply when the company is cash constrained, British Energy has the freedom to run its business, in terms of corporate, operational and financial policies. It continues as a public limited company managed by its board of directors and subject to the normal private sector disciplines and requirements. The agreements strike a balance between protecting taxpayers' interests and ensuring these private sector disciplines maximise the company's contributions to its liabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/9">Under the Commission's rules, rescue aid ceases once the commission has reached a decision on the restructuring aid. Therefore, no further drawings can be made on the loan facility that the Government have made available to British Energy since September 2002. All drawings on the facility have been repaid with interest by British Energy.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.5/10">The Government's main objectives in assisting British Energy remain safety and security of supply. A number of conditions of the restructuring remain to be satisfied, including that the Government must not have determined that British Energy will not be viable in all reasonably foreseeable circumstances. The condition remains in effect up to the restructuring effective date and the Government will continue to assess the company's viability until then. If the Government make such a determination at any time up to the restructuring effective date, or if there is a material adverse change in British Energy's position, the Government continue to reserve their right to withdraw their support for the restructuring. Therefore, contingency plans remain in place to secure our objectives if the restructuring plan fails for any reason and British Energy decides administration is the only option.</p>

	<p pid=".6WS.1/1">I am pleased to inform the House that on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-27">27 September 2004</phrase> I announced the launch of the Women and Work Commission, an ad hoc advisory group comprising members drawn from both sides of the social partnership, plus experts in their respective fields. It has been set up to make recommendations to the Government on tackling the pay gap between men and women. The gender pay gap has narrowed considerably from around 30 per cent. when the Equal Pay Act came into effect in 1975, and more women than ever before&mdash;13 million&mdash;are in employment. But persistent differences in men and women's experience of the labour market remain. The gender pay gap currently stands at 18 per cent. for full-time workers and 40 per cent. for part-time workers. In a full employment economy it is imperative that we harness the skills and talents of every potential worker. The Women and Work Commission will bring forward recommendations to the Prime Minister within 12 months to build on this Government's proud record of action in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/2">The Women and Work Commission will look at:</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/3" class="indent">how men's and women's education and skills affect which jobs they can get;</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/4" class="indent">promotion and career progression&mdash;the 'glass ceiling';</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/5" class="indent">women's experiences in the job market before and after having children; and</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/6" class="indent">the different experiences of women working full-time and part-time.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/7">The Women and Work Commission's Terms of Reference are as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/8">Women now make up 45 per cent. of the workforce, up from 38 per cent. in 1971. The Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act in the 1970s were important milestones in breaking down the barriers to women's participation in the labour market. But wages are low in many occupations dominated by women and there is still a gap in mean hourly earnings between men and women: it is 18 per cent. among full-time workers and 40 per cent. for those women working part-time.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/9">There are a number of factors influencing the gender pay gap. The DTI's review of maternity, paternity and flexible working legislation takes account of how caring responsibilities impact upon men and women's labour market attachment and their earnings. The Women and Work Commission will examine the other key factors shaping the difference in hourly earnings between men and women, including labour market experience, skills and education and discrimination. In investigating the impact of discrimination, the Commission will look at the measures necessary to strengthen equal pay legislation, including the case for equal pay reviews to be mandatory.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/10">Making progress on the gender pay gap is a key priority because in a full employment economy we have to draw on the skills and talents of all potential workers, men and women, and remove obstacles to women's greater participation in the labour market. But it is also important because women have the right to expect a fair deal in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/11">The aim of the Women and Work Commission will be to look at these wide-ranging influences on the gender pay gap:</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/12" class="indent">How men and women's educational experience and skills acquisition foreshadows occupational segregation.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/13" class="indent">General factors shaping women and men's labour market experience, including entry into employment, occupational segregation, full-time and part-time work experience, progression in the workplace and the tax and benefit system, as well as discrimination.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/14" class="indent">Women's experience in the labour market before and after having children As a substantial employer of women, the public sector warrants particular examination.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/15">The Commission will make recommendations to the Prime Minister within 12 months from autumn 2004, taking account of the importance of promoting employability, the wider benefits to the economy and the impact on employers and public expenditure. The Commission will take account of the DTI review of maternity, paternity and flexible working legislation in shaping its recommendations.</p>
