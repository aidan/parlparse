	<p>DFID has agreed a new three-year package of assistance worth &pound;40 million for the UK Overseas Territory of Montserrat. The commitment is included in a new country policy plan, as part of our ongoing partnership with Montserrat. The plan sets out our agreed strategy for continued working in support of efforts by the Government of Montserrat to rebuild essential infrastructure and to regenerate the island economy, in the aftermath of the volcanic crisis of the mid 1990s.</p>
	<p>As a result of that volcanic activity, most southern areas of the island&mdash;which included the capital town of Plymouth and the international airport&mdash;became uninhabitable and still remain subject to extremely restricted access for safety reasons. While the volcano remains active, the challenge has been to rebuild and provide basic facilities and services for the island community in the &quot;safe&quot; northern half of the island. Considerable progress has already been made, with DFID support totalling some &pound;206 million since the onset of the crisis.</p>
	<p>The focus for future support will be on activities that will help generate local revenue and encourage private sector investment. There are already some encouraging signs of private sector interest. A new airport, part funded by DFID, replacing the one lost to the volcano, will be completed later this year and should be a key contribution to the process of stimulating the economic growth that is needed.</p>

	<p class="indent">To complete the agreed inspection programme for CAP schemes in accordance with EU regulatory requirements, taking into account any approved derogations.</p>
	<p class="italic">Business Processes</p>
	<p class="indent">Subject to timely agreement on relevant CAP reform policy issues and the availability of the funding set out in the December 2003 business case, to have developed the new processing system in order to support the Single Payment Scheme under CAP reform so that payments under this scheme can be made during the 2005&ndash;06 scheme payment window.</p>
	<p class="indent">To provide 95 per cent. of customers by 31 March 2005 with details of that part of their entitlement under the Single Payment Scheme which relates to their historic receipts from existing schemes.</p>
	<p class="indent">To develop an effective procedure for resolving queries to support the provision of details of historic entitlements.</p>
	<p class="indent">To provide accurate and timely operational advice in support of policy development and DEFRA business systems.</p>
	<p class="italic">People</p>
	<p class="indent">To develop a baselined workforce planning strategy by 31 March 2005 to inform future staffing levels, skills requirements and reward policy.</p>

	<p class="indent">To reduce sick absence at BCMS by two days per staff year against the final outturn per staff year in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
