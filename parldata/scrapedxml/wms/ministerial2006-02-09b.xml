	<p pid="b.51WS.4/1">Subject to Parliamentary approval of any necessary supplementary estimate, the Cabinet Office DEL will be decreased by &pound;3,150,000 from &pound;226,144,000 to &pound;222,994,000. The administration costs limits will be decreased by &pound;3,570,000 from &pound;199,401,000 to &pound;195,831,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.51WS.4/15" class="indent">*Depreciation, which forms part of resource DEL, is excluded</p>
	<p pid="b.51WS.4/16" class="indent">from the total DEL since capital DEL includes capital spending and to include depreciation of those assets would lead to double counting.</p>
	<p pid="b.51WS.4/17">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from Machinery of Government (MoG) transfer of the Government Social Research Unit to HM Treasury and the Whips Offices (Lords and Commons) to the Privy Council Office. The resource implications are &pound;2,097,000 and &pound;914,000 respectively. Other outward transfers include the baseline for the Parliamentary Counsel Office to other Government Departments. Inward transfers include &pound;389,0000 from the Department of Trade and Industry to fund the Equalities Review, &pound;335,000 from various Government Departments to fund protective security measures relating to State and Government assets in central London and End Year Flexibility draw down of &pound;7,900,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.51WS.4/18">The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from the transfer of &pound;20,000 capital as part of the MoG transfer to the Privy Council Office and &pound;1,110,000 as part of the MoG transfer of Government Car and Despatch Agency to the Department for Transport. There is also a transfer of &pound;557,000 to Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre for the provision of a new building and infrastructure at Hanslope Park.</p>
