	ChangeUp: A Capacity Building and Infrastructure Framework
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-06-24.85WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1084" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="85WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040624/wmstext/40624m01.htm#40624m01.html_spmin0">
	<p>I am today announcing the launch of ChangeUp&mdash;a programme of investment specifically for capacity building and infrastructure in the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p>ChangeUp aims to ensure that by 2014 the needs of frontline voluntary and community organisations will be met by support which is available nationwide, structured for maximum efficiency, offering excellent provision which is accessible to all, truly reflecting and promoting diversity and sustainably funded. It sets out an architecture for how that infrastructure should develop and highlights key strategic actions that will bring it into being.</p>
	<p>ChangeUp has been created in response to the <i>2002 Cross-Cutting Review on the Role of the Voluntary and Community Sector in Service Delivery </i>which recommended that the voluntary and community sector and Government together draw up a strategy to underpin the capacity of the sector. The Home Office has led on the development of the framework, which has included a three-month consultation period on the document <i>Voluntary and Community Sector Infrastructure&mdash;A Consultation Document, </i>published in September 2003.</p>
	<p>ChangeUp sets out the principal capacity needs of frontline organisations&mdash;especially small and medium sized organisations. The main elements are performance improvement, workforce development and leadership, ICT, governance, supporting volunteers and financing voluntary and community sector activity. Each has a clear high level objective and achievable actions which will make a difference.</p>
	<p>It also describes how voluntary and community sector infrastructure should be modernised and reconfigured. The emphasis is on placing the voluntary and community sector in the driving seat, helping it to work with public sector partners and funders to agree the best way to provide high quality and sustainable support to frontline organisations.</p>
	<p>Nationally, expertise and leadership in particular areas should be provided by &quot;hubs&quot; which will build on best practice and reduce confusion in the sector by bringing people together to provide strategic leadership, signpost organisations to sources of support, and act as beacons of good practice, reaching directly to frontline organisations to develop advanced thinking and good practice.</p>
	<p>The ChangeUp framework will be used as a planning tool for Government, funders and voluntary and community sector partners at all levels and in different sectors to develop further action and will provide a point of reference for future thinking.</p>
	<p>Implementation will be underpinned by Home Office investment of &pound;72m of ChangeUp funds that will support strategic planning and catalyse modernisation of infrastructure provision to improve its quality and reach.</p>
	<p>Copies of the document are available in the House Library and on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. A regulatory impact assessment is also available with the document.</p>

	<p>I am pleased to announce today the publication of the &quot;Animal Health and Welfare Strategy for Great Britain.&quot;</p>
	<p>The strategy fulfils the Government's commitment made in the strategy for sustainable food and farming to work in partnership with industry, specialists and the wider community to provide an overarching framework for the development and implementation of policies in all areas of animal health and welfare. It is based on the public consultation launched on 15th July 2003 and has been jointly produced by Defra, the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
	<p>I have arranged for copies of the &quot;Animal Health and Welfare Strategy for Great Britain&quot; to be made available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p>The Government are publishing the sixth section of the <i>Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate (Framework)</i> on waste today. This is available on the sustainable development in Government website. Copies of the website, on CD-Rom, will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p>The waste section of the <i>Framework</i> sets for the first time a Government wide commitment to reduce waste on the Government estate, and increase recycling and composting rates. It encourages Departments to purchase re-usable, recyclable, and recycled products; and return used products to manufacturers. This will make an important contribution to the UK's target on reducing waste sent to landfill, and will help deliver our commitment to moving up the waste hierarchy towards more sustainable waste management practices.</p>
	<p>The <i>Framework </i>now requires all relevant waste management contracts to take account of measures and opportunities for reducing and avoiding the impact of waste, and for collecting waste management data. Departments must draw up sustainable waste management strategies setting out how they will deal with these issues.</p>
	<p>Our ongoing work on the <i>Framework </i>defines a set of cross-Government targets for sustainable development, and outlines the mechanisms by which Departments will be expected to achieve them. These challenging targets give a clear indication of the Government's continued determination to take a lead in the practical implementation and achievement of sustainable development.</p>

	<p class="indent">some 179 authorities met the performance standard for processing change of circumstances (9 days), compared to 160 in the same quarter of 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p>The statistics are un-audited and are provided quarterly by local authorities to my Department.</p>

	<p>My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister will publish for public consultation on 25 June, a paper on accounting for leaseholders monies.</p>
	<p>Service charge payers are entitled to be confident that the money they pay towards the upkeep of their building is held properly, and is used for the purposes it is provided for. This is an area which requires strengthening, and the accounting provisions in the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (the Act) provide for this.</p>
	<p>The consultation paper invites comments on the provisions in the Act that make changes to the way in which service charge monies are held, and the information that is provided to service charge payers.</p>
	<p>It sets out the proposals for regulations to be made by the Secretary of State. These regulations will set out the detailed requirements that landlords will have to comply with where the holding of service charge money and the provision of information relating to service charges are concerned.</p>
	<p>Copies of the paper are being sent to a wide range of interested parties including local authorities, housing associations, financial institutions and others with an interest in this issue. The closing date for responses is 24 September.</p>
	<p>Copies of the paper will be made available in the Libraries of the House, and will be available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/">http://www.odpm.gov.uk/</a> tomorrow.</p>
