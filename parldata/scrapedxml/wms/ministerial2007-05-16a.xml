Alongside this, I announced the creation of new Cabinet Committees on Crime and the Criminal Justice System and on Security and Terrorism. I am now announcing the membership and terms of reference of the new Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.5/2">Responsibility for the National Offender Management Service, and for criminal law and sentencing policy, moved from the Home Office to the new Ministry of Justice on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>. Public protection and crime reduction will continue to be the core focus of Government policy. The new Ministerial Committee on Crime and the Criminal Justice System (CJS) will take this forward.</p>

The existing sub-Committees on International Terrorism (DOP(IT)) and Protective Security and Resilience (DOP(IT)(PSR)) will therefore no longer operate.</p>
