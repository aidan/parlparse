	<p pid=".39WS.2/1">In March 2001 my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister asked the Social Exclusion Unit to lead a project</p>
	<p pid=".39WS.2/2" class="indent">Xto make running away less likely, and to ensure that runaways' long and short-term needs are safely met&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".39WS.2/3">Today we are publishing the final report on young runaways. It sets out a practical package of measures to ensure that young runaways will get the extra help and support to keep them safe and to address their problems.</p>
	<p pid=".39WS.2/4">Running away is a huge problem. Each year more than 77,000 young people run away: one in 14 will end up surviving by begging, stealing or getting involved in prostitution and drug-dealing. 20,000 each year are under 11 years old. Running away is a problem in itself but it can also mean that young people are more likely to suffer from social exclusion later in life with a higher risk of homelessness, crime and drug use.</p>
	<p pid=".39WS.2/5">We are putting the systems in place to make sure no-one falls through the net. This report shows how services must join together to work for the young person at risk. Practical measures will help to prevent young people from running in the first place. If they do run they will have someone to locate and make contact with them, help to negotiate a way home, a safe place to stay and access to longer-term help.</p>
	<p pid=".39WS.2/6">The report highlights how mainstream services need to work more effectively together to address the factors that can lead to running away and other problems. The Green Paper on Children at Risk announced in this House by the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase> will develop radical options for improving services for all children and young people at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".39WS.2/7">Later today, I will be visiting Step Forward, a Safe in the City project that provides a range of effective services to this vulnerable group, to launch the publication of the runaways report.</p>
	<p pid=".39WS.2/8">Copies of the report have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".40WS.2/15" class="indent">(viii) &pound;400,000 from the Department of Trade and Industry for the Manufacturing Advisory Service</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.2/16">The Wales Office administration costs limit will be increased by &pound;500,000 from &pound;2,330,000 to &pound;2,830,000.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.2/17">The increase in DEL will be offset by transfers from other Departments, from the reserve or take up of end-year flexibility and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.</p>

	<p pid=".46WS.4/1">I am pleased to announce that on <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase> The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (Commencement No.2) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/2833)(C.89), was made bringing into force the rights of way improvement planning provisions in sections 60 to 62 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-21">21 November 2002</phrase>. We are now publishing the guidance to local highway authorities on planning improvements to their rights of way network, which takes account of responses to the consultation paper that we issued at the end of last year. The guidance is being sent out to all local authorities in England.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/2">The guidance clarifies the new duty on local authorities to make a strategic and forward-looking assessment of their rights of way network, thinking about how any shortcomings might be overcome by making use of the powers they already have. This new approach will be of particular use in those areas that are tourist destinations, where the local economy is heavily dependent on the income that visitors bring. However, last year's foot-and-mouth outbreak showed just how important public rights of way are to rural businesses and communities generally.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/3">Access is also important to local people. Expanding our public rights of way network and improving access brings great health benefits. The changes don't have to be major. Sometimes the creation of a short connecting path is all that is necessary to provide a useful local cut through, to provide access to a local beauty spot, or to make the final link in a circular walk.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/4">Nor is it just about walkers. The rights of way network also provides access to the countryside for other types of users, and the planning process should look at how well they are catered for. One major aim is to increase provision for horse riders, carriage drivers and cyclists. We also want to increase access for those who cannot easily use all the current paths, particularly those with mobility problems and the blind or partially sighted.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/5">Some local authorities do an excellent job of maintaining and promoting their local footpaths but I know that there is concern that some local authorities fail to fulfil their existing duties and may be slow to plan for and implement their rights of way improvements. There are a number of ways in which we are trying to address these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/6">First, we have given local authorities extra resources for the new obligations under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2002 and I wrote to every local authority in England to remind them that the resources are there in the local government support grant. It is for local authorities to achieve the intended outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/7">Secondly, we are sponsoring the Countryside Agency to work with eight authorities, one from each region of England, to provide exemplar planning between October 2002 and October 2003. This will help to develop good practice and the lessons learned will be disseminated to other authorities at regular intervals. It is intended that this exemplar planning will demonstrate the value of planning to improve the network for people of all levels of interest, ability and experience.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/8">Finally, we want to achieve the long-term sustainability of the network while reducing the number of separate planning requirements. This is in line with the Government's wish to give local authorities additional freedoms and flexibilities. Rights of way improvement planning will therefore be incorporated into the local transport planning process from 2005 onwards, when the next 5-year Local Transport Plans are due to be produced. In this way we intend to ensure that the full importance of the rights of way is stressed in the light of the contribution it can make to transport, recreation and health. This will encourage a focused and joined up approach by local authorities. It is envisaged that rights of way improvement planning will be a distinct strand within the new Local Transport Plans. The revised <i>Guidance on Full Local Transport Plans</i> (planned for 2004) will cover this point.</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/9">In the meantime, local highway authorities should use the new guidance, being published tomorrow, to plan effective improvements to their rights of way network in line with their new duty. Under the provisions of section 60 to 62 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, local highway authorities are required by law to prepare the first rights of way improvement plans within five years. We suggest that local highway authorities prepare them earlier than this if possible. Indeed, it is encouraging to know that many authorities have already started on the planning process. This work will make a positive difference and will be every bit as valid after rights of way improvement planning is incorporated into the local transport planning process</p>
	<p pid=".46WS.4/10">A copy of the commencement order and statutory guidance have been placed in the House of Commons Library. . Further information can be found on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/index.htm</a>. A copy of the summary of the responses to the consultation exercise earlier this year is also on the website.</p>

	Access to Land

	<p pid=".48WS.1/1">I am pleased to announce that we have decided that the new right for the public to walk on mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land will be rolled out on a region by region basis. We are convinced that the best approach is to give walkers the right to walk in open countryside and on registered common land as early as possible. Rather than wait for the mapping process to be completed for the whole country, I intend to open up land in the first two regions, the South East and Central Southern England, to public access during the summer of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".48WS.1/2">This is a demanding timetable which requires conclusive maps for those regions to be available, restrictions on access and necessary exclusions to be in place and guidance and codes of practice to be available to walkers and landowners. It is most important that all these mechanisms are in force in each region before any access land is made available to the public to ensure that the interests of both land managers and walkers are safeguarded. We expect all access land to be opened not later than the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".48WS.1/3">Opening some access land more than a year earlier than originally planned shows our commitment to making the provisions of Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 a reality. Because of that Act, people will be able to walk on land in some of the most beautiful areas of the countryside that were previously off-limits and rural businesses in those areas will benefit from new trading opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".48WS.1/4">In bringing the new right of access into force, we have maintained a careful balance between the rights of walkers and the rights of land managers. It does not affect land managers' discretion to use or develop land as they think best, taking into account other regulations governing changes of land use. In the vast majority of cases it is likely to have very little impact on operational practices. Owners and occupiers will be able to close their land for up to 28 days each year for any reason, and to seek further restrictions or exclusions of access where necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".50WS.4/1">I have agreed with my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury that, from April 2003, the National Health Service pension scheme will assume its full liability for pensions increase costs. The change, which will bring the National Health Service into line with other public service schemes, will mean an increase in employer contributions from 7 to 14 per cent. of pay. Employee contributions will remain unchanged.</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.4/2">The additional costs will be fully covered by a transfer of funds into the Department of Health's departmental expenditure limit (DEL) baseline. This will be extra funding, on top of expenditure plans announced in the last Budget, and is included in the Chancellor's pre-Budget Report made yesterday. This means there will be no reduction in the resources already earmarked for healthcare.</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.4/3">Arrangements for increasing the employer contribution rate will be phased in with costs paid centrally from the Department's DEL in the first year. It is expected that employers will be charged the higher rate from April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.4/4">A Departmental working group has been remitted to develop detailed implementation plans for handling the transfer. Alongside the financial arrangements for transferring and allocating resources, it will look at the human resource aspects of the change. This will include improving recognition of the full value of National Health Service pension scheme in recruitment, retention and return to service as well as the full costs of employment.</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.4/5">The new 14 per cent employer contribution rate is based on the Government actuary's emerging findings in his latest valuation of the National Health Service pension scheme. The Government actuary's report is expected to be published in the new year and copies will be placed in the Library.</p>

Prominent among the issues that led to the announcement of the review was that primary care trusts (PCTs) in their effort to deliver improved local patient care also focussed on education and research. The terms of reference directly tackle this concern and are, in the light of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002, to:</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.6/3" class="indent">review the role of PCTs in ensuring the right balance is struck between care for NHS patients, learning and research;</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.6/4" class="indent">consider the responsibilities of PCTs in supporting research and learning across all health care professions in the NHS and identify those responsibilities that are proving difficult to achieve;</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.6/5" class="indent">report to Ministers by December 2003, including any recommendations for action that may be required to enable PCTs to discharge their responsibilities more effectively; and</p>

	<p pid=".50WS.6/7">In line with commitments already given by my noble Friend Lord Hunt, the review will:</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.6/8" class="indent">be carried out jointly by the Department of Health, Department for Education and Skills and the National Assembly for Wales;</p>
	<p pid=".50WS.6/9" class="indent">be overseen by Ministers from each Department;</p>

	<p pid=".52WS.1/15">The change in the resource element of the DEL for the Department of Health arises from: the take up of end year flexibility &pound;404,844,000 for health authority and central allocations as set out in Table 6 of the public expenditure 2001&ndash;02 provisional outturn White Paper Cm 5574 published in July 2002; a change in the level of National Health Service trust depreciation &pound;184,000,000; a net transfer from the Home Office of &pound;3,900,000 comprising &pound;1,824,000 for match funded social care projects, &pound;938,000 community projects relating to assessment and treatment of people with severe personality disorder, &pound;673,000 for a contribution towards the Victoria Climbie Inquiry, &pound;450,000 for Broadmoor hospital pilot ward, &pound;30,000 for a survey of smoking, drinking and drug use in young people, offset by &pound;15,000 for a grant to Mediation UK to recruit volunteer service managers; from the Scottish Executive &pound;385,000 for a contribution towards the Nursing Midwives Council; from the Office for National Statistics &pound;130,000 (&pound;127,000 administration costs) for the neighbourhood statistics programme; from the Department of Trade and Industry &pound;75,000 (administration costs) for a contribution towards the costs of the human genetics commission.</p>
	<p pid=".52WS.1/16">These increases are offset by a transfer to the Department for Education and Skills of &pound;8,120,000 for drug prevention and the healthy schools programme.</p>
	<p pid=".52WS.1/17">The Department of Health's administration cost limit has increased by &pound;6.136,000 from &pound;318,527,000 to &pound;324,663,000. In addition to the changes detailed above there is a transfer of &pound;7,500,000 for education and training, offset by &pound;1,566,000 for hospital episode statistics, the disability equipment evaluation programme, the NHS appointments commission and the standing committee for hospitals of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".52WS.1/18">The increase in the FSA DEL is the result of take-up of end year flexibility of &pound;16,950,000 (of which &pound;2,816,000 is administration costs). The FSA manages it resource spend over the three year Government spending review period. This end year flexibility is needed to address future FSA and meat hygiene services funding pressures that have already been identified.</p>
	<p pid=".52WS.1/19">As a result of these changes the gross administration cost limit for the FSA has increased by &pound;2,816,000 to &pound;55,119,000.</p>
	<p pid=".52WS.1/20">The increases will be offset by inter-departmental transfers and take up of end year flexibility and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.</p>

	<p pid=".53WS.2/1">I am pleased to report to the House that forecasts for this year suggest an encouraging rise in farm incomes, of 11 per cent (9 per cent in real terms), in comparison to 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.2/2">We recognise that farmers are experiencing hard times, therefore any increase in incomes is welcome news. This is the second year running that there has been an increase&mdash;a reversal of a sharp decline since 1995, although we recognise this remains &pound;2.99 billion below the yearly average for TIFF, for the period 1989 to 1994.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.2/3">These increases reflect the efforts of farmers to improve business performance. Government is playing its part by investing in the rural economy. There is a lot more to do, but we are working with the industry to create the right conditions for a sustainable and competitive future for farmers.</p>

	<p pid=".53WS.7/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) inspection report on Caerphilly County Borough Council was published today and copies of the report in English and Welsh have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.7/2">The report finds that Caerphilly County Borough Council does not have an up-to-date corporate document that sets out the aims and objectives for the benefit service.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.7/3">The council placed an emphasis on paying benefit quickly and the achievement of this compromised the aims of getting payments right first time and deterring fraud. From its sample, the report finds that 100 per cent of Rent Rebate and Council Tax Benefit, and 84 per cent of Rent Allowance claims were processed within 14 days of all information being available. The council had no backlogs of work to hinder the claims processing times. However, the council failed to routinely verify information and evidence in support of claims. Security was not an integral part of the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. Caerphilly County Borough Council had not implemented the Verification Framework and had no plans to do so. From its sample, the report finds that the quality of verification was poor compared to the Verification Framework benchmark and that the gateway to the benefits system was weak.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.7/4">The report finds that the council effectively administered renewal claims and ensured continuity of benefit payments to claimants. However, over 1,000 claims were not renewed in 2000/01 and the council took limited action to establish the reasons.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.7/5">The council dealt with changes of circumstances promptly, pursued overpayments of benefit vigorously and had an effective rate of recovery. The council made use of legal action and debt collection agencies to recover debt where other recovery options had failed.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.7/6">The council investigated benefit fraud and had completed successful prosecutions. However, there was some scope for improvement in working with other organisations and in the quality and speed of investigations.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.7/7">Management reporting and risk analysis also needed improvement, as the lack of reliable management information and risk analysis impacted on the council's ability to effectively manage its benefit service and counter fraud activity.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.7/8">In 2000/01, Caerphilly County Borough Council administered approximately* &pound;39.5 million in housing benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".53WS.7/9">My Rt hon Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.</p>

	<p pid=".56WS.2/1">We have been looking at how to optimise the Royal Artillery to meet the demands of the new security environment.</p>
	<p pid=".56WS.2/2">The Army currently has two combined regular Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) (Phoenix) Regiments; 32 Regiment Royal Artillery based at Larkhill, Wiltshire and 39 Regiment Royal Artillery at Harlow Hill near Newcastle. Each of these regiments has two batteries of nine MLRS launchers, and one battery of three troops of UAVs (Phoenix).</p>
	<p pid=".56WS.2/3">As a result of past successful deployments the capability of Phoenix has become more widely recognised and valued within the military command structure. It has, therefore, been decided that a revised structure would provide a better focus for UAVs. In line with the direction set in the New Chapter to the Strategic Defence Review this new structure will establish UAVs as a valuable asset for surveillance and intelligence gathering in addition to being Royal Artillery target acquisition assets to support the Indirect Fire System. The impact on the Royal Artillery will be the separation of these capabilities and the creation of discrete regiments; UAV (Phoenix) at Larkhill and MLRS at Harlow Hill. The reorganisation will require inter-regimental moves of complete sub-units but will not have any significant impact on the overall numbers of personnel at each site.</p>
	<p pid=".56WS.2/4">The Field Standard B2 variant of the Rapier missile system has reached the end of its useful life and will be withdrawn from service by <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>. The system is currently operated by 22 Regiment Royal Artillery, based at Kirton-in-Lindsey, Lincolnshire. Following the withdrawal of the Rapier FSB2 equipment, 22 Regiment will undertake a tour in Cyprus, in the infantry role, during the second half of 2003 before it is disbanded in March 2004. Personnel from the regiment will be re-deployed to other Royal Artillery units to support the introduction of planned new &quot;network-centric&quot; capabilities as described in the New Chapter, including the Watchkeeper UAV.</p>
	<p pid=".56WS.2/5">Our future Rapier air defence capability will be based on the more advanced Field Standard C model operated by 16 Regiment Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force Regiment. The capability of 16 Regiment will be enhanced by the creation of a fourth battery. In addition, we plan to move 16 Regiment from Woolwich to Kirton-in-Lindsey in late 2004. It will then be close to both the Air Warfare Centre at RAF Waddington and the Joint Rapier Training Unit at Honington bringing a number of practical benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".57WS.2/2">From that date, if an applicant for support from the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) makes an asylum claim immediately on arrival at the port then support will be granted provided the other criteria for support are fulfilled. If the person fails, without a good reason, to make an asylum claim immediately at the port of arrival then support will be refused unless one of the exceptions applies.</p>
	<p pid=".57WS.2/3">These exceptions cover families with children, those with special needs, those claiming asylum in country following a significant change in circumstances in their country of origin (provided they make their asylum claim at the earliest possible opportunity following that change of circumstances) and those who can show they would otherwise suffer treatment contrary to article 3 European Convention on Human Rights. Persons falling within these exceptions may be granted support (assuming they otherwise qualify for it) even if they have not claimed asylum on arrival at the port.</p>
	<p pid=".57WS.2/4">But apart from these exceptions, we expect all single asylum seekers or couples without children who wish to claim asylum and who want MASS support to make an immediate application for asylum at the port of arrival. It will not be acceptable for an asylum seeker wanting MASS support to postpone making an asylum claim unless there is a very good reason for doing so. And even if there is a good reason for not claiming asylum immediately on arrival at the port, the person must claim asylum as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".57WS.2/5">The Secretary of State is prohibited by statute from providing support unless he is satisfied that the person claiming support has made the asylum claim as soon as reasonably practicable after arrival in the United Kingdom. In most cases, for those not within the exceptions, that will mean, claiming asylum immediately on arrival at the port.</p>

	<p pid=".58WS.5/1">The report of the UK Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-28">Thursday 28 November 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".58WS.5/2">The Working Group was chaired by the Secretary of State for International Development. It's members include representatives from the Department of Health, Department of Trade and Industry and HM Treasury, pharmaceutical industry leaders, representatives of the World Health Organisation, the World Trade Organisation, the European Commission, Charitable Foundations and the Ugandan High Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid=".58WS.5/3">AIDS, TB and Malaria cause six million deaths a year&mdash;10% of the world annual death toll. This means the loss of $120 billion value in work and productivity each year mostly in the developing world thus impoverishing families and countries that carry this disease burden. AIDS alone has reduced average national economic growth rates across Africa by 2 to 4 percentage points. Many of these deaths could be prevented with existing treatments&mdash;but&mdash;just one example&mdash;in Africa only one in three people have access to effective malaria treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".58WS.5/4">The report proposes that pharmaceutical companies provide drugs at near to cost price for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria to the poorest countries, whose governments guarantee that tariffs are removed and reduced cost drugs will not be re-exported. Development agencies commit to working with such governments to develop basic health care systems capable of delivering the drugs to the people in need.</p>
	<p pid=".58WS.5/5">Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House and are also available from the Vote Office and from the Department. It can also be accessed at: <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>.</p>
