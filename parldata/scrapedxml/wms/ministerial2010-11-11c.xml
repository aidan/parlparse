	Decent Homes Funding

	<p pid="c.19WS.5/1">Since coming to office the Government have made clear that our most urgent priority is to tackle the UK's record deficit in order to restore confidence in our economy and support the recovery. Throughout the spending review the Government have been guided by a commitment to fairness, protecting the most vulnerable people in our society and as far as possible protecting front-line services. In DCLG, that commitment includes continuing to fund the decent homes programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.19WS.5/2">The spending review announced that the Government will invest over &#163;2 billion of capital funding to help towards completing the decent homes programme. Of this, funding of &#163;1.595 billion is available over the next four years to help make local authority social homes decent (with an additional &#163;0.510 billion being provided for &quot;gap&quot; funding existing stock transfers). We will be working with the Homes and Communities Agency to ensure that decent homes funding is allocated where it is needed and in order to support the self-financing settlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.19WS.5/3">The coalition Government wish to be fair in their approach to all, so we will not be as rigid about local structures as the last Government. This funding will help ensure that all councils can deliver a sustainable 30-year business plan under self-financing. It would therefore not be appropriate to restrict access to funding on the basis of current organisational structure or performance. We will therefore open the process of allocation of funding for the period 2011-15 to all local authorities who have a significant backlog of decent homes work. This Government consider that the two-star rating is not in itself a guarantee of ability to run a capital programme, or of good value for money; there will, therefore, be no requirement for a two-star housing inspection standard to be achieved to access funding. This is also unfair to tenants who have little control over the star rating of their landlord, but are currently made to suffer a potentially un-decent home as a result. In future it will be up to councils whether they want these inspections to go ahead reflecting the Government's commitment to reduce regulatory burdens on local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.19WS.5/4">Today, we are jointly publishing with the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) our proposals for managing the allocation process in a consultation document and welcome the views of local authorities, arm's length management organisations and other interested parties on how we propose to gather information and make fair funding decisions. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Ratification of Treaties)

	<p pid="c.22WS.2/1">The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 Commencement Order No.3 was made today <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-11">11 November</phrase>, 2010. This brings into force part 2 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (CRaG Act) which deals with the ratification of treaties. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has overall responsibility for the conclusion of treaties, and leads on policy in this respect. Part 2 of the CRaG Act is the new basis for treaty scrutiny by Parliament, and replaces the former constitutional practice dating from 1924, known as &quot;The Ponsonby Rule&quot;, with statutory provisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/2">The effects of part 2 of the Act may be summarised as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/3"><i>Section 20</i> provides that a treaty that is subject to ratification or its equivalent, is to be published and laid before Parliament for a period of 21 sitting days, during which both Houses have the opportunity to resolve that the treaty should not be ratified. If the 21 sitting days expire with no such resolution being passed by either House, the Government can proceed to ratify the treaty. It also defines the legal effect of a negative vote by either House.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/4"><i>Section 21</i> provides a mechanism for Parliament to request extensions to the 21 sitting day period, in blocks of up to 21 sitting days, at the discretion of the relevant Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/5"><i>Section</i><i> 22</i> provides an &quot;alternative procedure&quot; in exceptional cases where a Minister is of the opinion that it should be ratified without following the procedures in section 20.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/6"><i>Section</i><i> 23</i> makes provision for classes of treaties that are to be dealt with differently because they are scrutinised by other means, notably-(i) under the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 or the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008, (ii) agreements and arrangements relating to taxation, or (iii) because scrutiny of them is not for the UK Parliament that is, treaties concluded by overseas territories, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as authorised by HMG.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/7"><i>Section 24</i><i></i>requires that treaties laid before Parliament under section 20 shall be accompanied by an explanatory memorandum explaining the provisions of the treaty, the reasons for HMG seeking ratification of the treaty, and other relevant information.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/8"><i>Section</i><i> 25</i> defines &quot;treaty&quot; and &quot;ratification&quot; for the purposes of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/9">The Act changes the Ponsonby rule in several respects:</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/10">Part 2 gives legal effect to a vote against ratification in the Commons or Lords. It prevents the Government from moving immediately to ratify a treaty if either House votes against ratification.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/11">If the Government nevertheless wish to proceed to ratification, the Minister must lay a statement giving reasons why. If the Commons voted against, a further 21 sitting day period must expire before ratification can take place. If the Commons vote against ratification during this subsequent 21 sitting days, the Government are prevented from ratifying the treaty. However, a statement can be laid more than once and therefore this process can continue. If the Lords vote against ratification, but the Commons do not, then a ministerial statement must be laid before Parliament explaining why the treaty should nevertheless be ratified.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/12">The definition of &quot;sitting days&quot; is limited to days on which both Houses sit.</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/13">Part 2 also provides that the Minister can extend the sitting period by 21 sitting days or less (and votes against ratification will continue to have legal effect in this period).</p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/14">Part 2 also requires the Minister, if the &quot;alternative procedure&quot; in clause 23 is being used in exceptional circumstances, to lay a statement giving reasons.<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101213/corrtext/101213c0001.htm#column_3MC"><i>[Official Report, 13 December 2010, Vol. 520, c. 3MC.]</i></a></p>
	<p pid="c.22WS.2/15">Guidance on the ratification of treaties and part 2 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 is published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on its website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/treaty">www.fco.gov.uk/treaty</a>).</p>

	<p pid="c.24WS.1/1">The arms embargo in Iraq continues under United Nations Security Council resolution 1546 with exemptions for supplies of arms and related mat&#233;riel required by the Government of Iraq (GoI) or the multinational force (MNF) to serve the purposes of the resolution.</p>
	<p pid="c.24WS.1/2">Following a thorough review of its procedures for processing export licence applications to Iraq, Her Majesty's Government will consider as exempt from the embargo exports to the GoI, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, diplomatic missions in Iraq, the US forces in Iraq, the NATO training mission in Iraq, the UK naval training mission training the Iraqi Navy and entities contracted or subcontracted to the GoI, US or UK forces or NATO. Export licence applications to these end users will not therefore require the approval of the GoI prior to approval of the application but may require extra information to be provided by the entity seeking the export licence. For exports serving the purposes of UNSCR 1546 to entities other than these, the exporter is required to provide a supporting document from the GoI to demonstrate that the proposed export is required and thus exempt from the embargo. All export licence applications for Iraq as elsewhere will be assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria and will not issue a licence where to do so would be inconsistent with the criteria.</p>
