<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-01-11.9WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/784" speakername="Ivor Caplin" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="9WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050111/wmstext/50111m01.htm#50111m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".9WS.2/1">I am announcing today that a new order has been made under section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 so that reservists may continue to be called out into service to support operations in Iraq. The new order is effective until <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-06">6 January 2006</phrase>. This replaces the order which expired earlier this month.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.2/2">During the course of last year some 2,350 reservists were called out and accepted into service to support operations in Iraq. Details of the next tranche of reservists to be called out were announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-14">14 December 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-12-14.121"><i>Official Report</i>, column 121WS</phrase>. Some 900 army reservists are involved and they will be deployed to theatre from April where the majority will complete six month tours. We are very appreciative of the continuing support and commitment shown by both reservists, their employers and their families.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-01-11.9WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/970" speakername="Geoff Hoon" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="9WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050111/wmstext/50111m01.htm#50111m01.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".9WS.4/1">As the House will be aware, our policy is to keep the Brigade of Gurkhas' terms and conditions of service under review, to ensure that they are fair and that any differences from the wider Army are reasonable and justifiable. We are also aware of our historic relationship and understandings with the Governments of Nepal and India, which have enabled Gurkhas to serve in the British Army since 1947.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.4/2">Gurkha soldiers have spent an increasing proportion of their time in UK since withdrawal from Hong Kong in 1997, and successive amendments to the conditions under which they serve have recognised their changing role, status and personal aspirations. The most recent of these was their inclusion in the new HM forces immigration rule, which took effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-25">25 October 2004</phrase>. This has potentially far-reaching effects on the way we recruit and manage the brigade and care for its serving members, families and veterans. In addition, some public criticism and unease continues about the remaining differences between Gurkhas' terms and conditions and those of the wider Army. We are, therefore, anxious to ensure that such differences are absolutely justifiable as well as fully understood and accepted by our Gurkha soldiers and want to ensure that the MOD's position, both legally and morally, is beyond reproach.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.4/3">I have therefore directed that the MOD should carry out a wide-ranging review of all Gurkha terms and conditions of service. This will be an extensive piece of work and we will endeavour to take account of the views of all those with a legitimate interest. This new review will build on earlier findings, including work to date on the review of Gurkha married accompanied service (MAS), but its scope will be much wider and it is aiming to complete in late autumn 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.4/4">I am aware that the outcome of the view of Gurkha MAS review has been keenly anticipated by the Gurkhas themselves and by those concerned about Gurkha welfare. I regret that this work is not yet finally completed but I expect to receive an interim report on the new study, which will enable me to make an announcement on Gurkha MAS, in early summer 2005.</p>
