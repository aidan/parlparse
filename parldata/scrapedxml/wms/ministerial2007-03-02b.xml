<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-02b.105WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" speakeroffice="The Paymaster General" colnum="105WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070302/wmstext/70302m0001.htm#07030261000137">
	<p pid="b.105WS.2/1">This Government are determined to ensure that all individuals pay the proper amount of tax on their employment income, other non-employment income and capital gains. Despite the Government's focus on tackling tax avoidance schemes, there are a minority who continue to seek ways to avoid paying an appropriate share of tax, which is unfair on the majority of taxpayers and can undermine funding of public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.105WS.2/2">The Government have continued to see evidence of schemes that use partnerships to generate losses that can be offset by individuals against other income or capital gains using sideways loss relief. HMRC's compliance activity in this area and the disclosures that have been received, following the extension of disclosure rules to cover loss creation schemes from <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August 2006</phrase>, have highlighted that this type of avoidance activity is still widespread. Despite the introduction of extensive anti-avoidance legislation in this area, scheme providers are continuing to devise and operate more contrived schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.105WS.2/3">Prompt and decisive action is required to ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. The Government are therefore announcing with effect from today two changes to the rules for sideways loss relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.105WS.2/4">Currently, the amount of a partnership's trading losses for a tax year for which a non-active partner can claim sideways loss relief is restricted broadly to the amount of capital that the partner has contributed to the partnership. The Government propose to introduce new legislation to exclude certain capital contributions from this amount. The capital contributions to be excluded will be those paid by non-active partners on or after <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-02">2 March 2007</phrase> where the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, for contributing the capital to the partnership is for the partner to obtain a reduction in tax liability by means of sideways loss relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.105WS.2/5">The Government also propose to introduce an annual limit of &pound;25,000 on the amount of trading losses for a tax year for which an individual who is a non-active partner in a partnership can claim sideways loss reliefs. The new limit will apply to trading losses sustained as a non-active partner on or after <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-02">2 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.105WS.2/6">Legislation will be included in this year's Finance Bill. A technical note with full details of this measure will be issued on HMRC's website today.</p>

	<p pid="b.106WS.2/1">The 2007 Report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body has now been published. I wish to express my thanks to the Chairman and members of the Review Body for their Report. I am pleased to confirm that the AFPRB's recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.106WS.2/2">In line with the AFPRB recommendations, the basic military salary for officers and all other ranks will increase by 3.3 per cent. In addition, a restructuring of Pay Range 1 will see those on the lowest pay level, some 13,000 servicemen and women, receive a total pay increase of 9.2 per cent. A further 6,000 service personnel on the next lowest level will receive 6.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.106WS.2/3">The rates of Specialist Pay (including Flying Pay, Submarine Pay, Diving Pay and Hydrographic Pay) will also increase by 3.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.106WS.2/4">The Government have also accepted the AFPRB's recommendation to introduce additional targeted Financial Retention Incentives for Royal Marine and Infantry Other Ranks, and an extension to the Aircrew Financial Retention Incentive, in order to meet specific challenges in retaining our experienced people.</p>
	<p pid="b.106WS.2/5">Also, the AFPRB have confirmed their support for the introduction of the tax-free Operational Allowance, which I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-10-10.175"><i>Official Report</i>, column 175</phrase>, and has so far been paid to around 31,000 servicemen and women who have served in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans; and the removal of the 100 day initial qualifying period for the Longer Separation Allowance. Together these measures demonstrate this Government's commitment to provide special recognition for those serving their country on operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.106WS.2/6">Copies of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body Report are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.107WS.2/1">We shall lay before Parliament regulations to increase National Health Service charges in England from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. There will be a cash increase in the prescription charge of 20p from &pound;6.65 to &pound;6.85 for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed.</p>
	<p pid="b.107WS.2/2">The cost of prescription prepayment certificates will rise to &pound;35.85 for a four-month certificate and &pound;98.70 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for those needing more than five items in four months or 14 in one year.</p>
	<p pid="b.107WS.2/3">Prescription charges are expected to raise some &pound;425 million for the NHS in 2007-08.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-02b.108WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" speakername="Patricia Hewitt" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health" colnum="108WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070302/wmstext/70302m0001.htm#07030261000141">
	<p pid="b.108WS.1/1">I am responding on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to the Twenty-second Report of the Review Body for Nursing and Other Health Professions (NOHPRB), Cm 7029, and the Thirty-sixth Report of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB), Cm 7025, which were laid before Parliament yesterday. The reports have been placed in the Library and copies are available for hon. Members from the Vote Office. I am grateful to the chairs and members of the Review Bodies for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid="b.108WS.1/2">The NOHPRB has recommended an increase in the agenda for change pay rates of 2.5 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. The NOHPRB has also recommended that the minimum and maximum high cost area supplements should be increased by 2.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.108WS.1/3">The DDRB has recommended that the basic rate of pay for junior doctors should be increased by &pound;650 (equivalent to about &pound;1,000 when the banding multiplier is applied) and of all other hospital doctors by &pound;1,000. The DDRB has also recommended that the top and bottom of the salary range for salaried general medical practitioners should be increased by &pound;1,000. In addition they have recommended a zero increase in GP pay and an increase of 3.0 per cent. in the gross earnings base for general dental practitioners. The DDRB calculate that their recommendations will increase the NHS medical and dental pay bill per head by just under 2.0 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.108WS.1/4">The review bodies pay recommendations are being accepted. However, to ensure consistency with the Government's inflation target, and in line with other parts of the public sector, the awards will be staged. All awards which represent an increase up to and including 1.5 per cent. will be paid in full from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase>. But all awards which represent an increase above 1.5 per cent. will be paid in two stages, with 1.5 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> and the balance from <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November</phrase>. The Government recognise that the staff affected will be disappointed that their award is not being paid in full from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase>. But we believe that this approach is fair for staff, consistent with the Government's inflation target and affordable for the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="b.109WS.2/1">The sixth report of the independent Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) on the pay of Governing governors and other operational managers, prison officers and related support grades in England and Wales in 2007 has been published today and copies placed in the Library. I would like to thank the Chair and members of the PSPRB for their hard work in producing their recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/2">The PSPRB has recommended a restructuring of the prison officer pay scale to a new seven-point scale and a restructuring of the pay ranges for Governing governors and other operational managers within a new 21-point spine, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. The PSPRB has also recommended for those staff not affected by the restructuring (Principal and Senior prison officers, prison officers on the second long service incremental point and unified support grades) an increase in basic pay of 2.5 per cent. The recommendations will lead to a 2.8 per cent. growth in overall paybill to &pound;888 million (excluding oncosts).</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/3">Whilst I have decided that the PSPRB's recommendations will be implemented in full, the Government have announced that all Pay Review Body awards&mdash;including Doctors, Dentists, Nurses and Judges, as well as prison officers&mdash;will be staged so as to be consistent with the Government's wider economic objectives to secure economic stability and steady growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/4">The key Pay Review Body recommendations are:</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/5" class="indent">(1) A restructuring of the prison officer pay scale to a new seven-point scale;</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/6" class="indent">(2) A restructuring of the pay ranges for operational managers within a new 21-point spine;</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/7" class="indent">(3) Required Hours Addition for operational managers to be uprated by 2.5 per cent;</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/8" class="indent">(4) The Operation Tornado emergency response payment to prison officers to be uprated to &pound;18 per hour;</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/9" class="indent">(5) On Call allowances and dirty protest payment uprated by 2.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/10" class="indent">(6) A 2.5 per cent. increase to the basic pay rates of Principal and Senior prison officers, prison officers on the existing Second Long Service incremental pay point and unified support grades;</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/11" class="indent">(7) All other allowances and ex-gratia payments to remain at their current levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/12">Recommendations (1) to (5) will be implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase>. Recommendations (1) and (2) will benefit those below the top pay scale by up to 10 per cent. Recommendation (6) will be paid in two stages; 1.5 per cent. will be paid from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> (in line with other Pay Review Bodies), with the balance to 2.5 per cent. paid from <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase>. The cost of the award will be met from within the delegated budget allocation for the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.109WS.2/13">The Government remain committed to the independent Pay Review Body process. They do not take decisions to stage recommendations lightly. This year's decisions do not provide any indication of future responses.</p>

	<p pid="b.110WS.7/1">Further to the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, at Treasury Questions, on the Government's response to the reports of the pay review bodies, the 29th Report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries was published yesterday. This makes recommendations about the pay of the senior civil service (SCS), senior military personnel and the judiciary. Copies were laid in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the Chairman and members of the Review Body for their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/2" class="italic">Senior Civil Service</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/3">The Review Body's main recommendations for senior civil servants' pay are:</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/4">1. Changes to SCS pay ranges as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.110WS.7/7"> <td><i>Pay Band</i></td> <td><i>Minimum</i><i>&pound;</i></td> <td><i>Recruitment and Performance Ceiling</i><i>&pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.110WS.7/8"> <td>1</td> <td>56,100</td> <td>116,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.110WS.7/9"> <td>1A</td> <td>65,280</td> <td>127,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.110WS.7/10"> <td>2</td> <td>81,600</td> <td>160,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.110WS.7/11"> <td>3</td> <td>99,960</td> <td>205,000</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/14">2. The bonus pot for the SCS to be increased by 1.1 percentage points to 7.6 per cent. of the paybill and for the minimum bonus to remain at &pound;3,000; and</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/15">3. The Permanent Secretaries' new range to be &pound;139,740 to &pound;273,250.</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/16">The Review Body broadly endorses the Government's strategy for senior reward but places a slightly greater emphasis on bonus awards rather than base pay awards, with a recommendation of a headline award of 1.4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/17">In line with the approach taken across all pay review body groups, the Government have decided to accept the recommended headline award of 1.4 per cent., which is less than the Government proposed in evidence. The recommendation for bonus awards is also being accepted, but payment will be delayed until <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/18" class="italic">Senior Military Personnel</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/19">The Review Body's main recommendation for the senior military is an increase of 2 per cent. in the incremental pay scales for senior military officers. In line with the approach taken across all pay review body groups, the Government have decided to accept the recommendation, as this is in line with what the Government proposed in evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/20" class="italic">Judiciary</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/21">The Review Body's main recommendation for the judiciary is an increase averaging 2.4 per cent. for judicial salaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/22">In line with the approach taken across all pay review body groups, the Government have decided to accept the recommended headline award of 2.4 per cent. but are staging this to ensure affordability within existing spending limits and consistency with continuing control of public finances. All office holders will receive 1.5 per cent. with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, and the balance of the recommended amount will be paid with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/23" class="italic">Members of Parliament and Ministers</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/24">The Review Body's recommendations on SCS Pay mean that Ministers' and MP's pay, which is linked to the average increase in the midpoint of SCS pay, will increase by 0.66 per cent. The Review Body is also currently conducting a triennial review of MPs' and Ministers' pay which is due to report in summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.110WS.7/25">The cost of the awards for the SCS, senior military personnel, the judiciary and Ministers will be met from within existing Departmental Expenditure Limits.</p>

	<p pid="b.112WS.2/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase> in Brussels. There were no health or consumer affairs issues. I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.2/2">The first items were the preparation for the Spring European Council and the Tripartite Social Summit through the endorsement of a set of key messages to the European Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.2/3">Ministers endorsed the key messages from EPSCO to the Spring European Council. There were calls for new EU minimum social standards but they did not receive much of an echo as there was more interest in the strengthening of the social dimension of the Lisbon process. Nine member states, led by France, said the joint letter they had signed last week supported the presidency's goal of strengthening social Europe. I endorsed the broad focus of the key messages, and stated that there was a lot the UK could support in last week's letter, e.g. the idea of social Europe supporting working people and citizens more widely in particular the most disadvantaged; the need to uphold European values of cohesion, solidarity and social justice; and the emphasis on lifelong learning, equal opportunities and poverty. However, it was important also to emphasise flexible labour market and the dismantling of barriers to mobility. I added that the means by which we promoted these objectives were important as the existing body of directives already provided the basis for fair and decent minimum standards, and we were not persuaded of the case for further new minimum social standards. We should focus instead on delivering Lisbon and our individual National Reform Programmes. The presidency concluded that the European social dimension needed common objectives, notably on combating poverty, especially child poverty and social exclusion. Migration could be covered too, even though it had not been mentioned in this meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.2/4">The Tripartite Social Summit on the eve of the Spring Council would discuss the Commission's strategy for 2008 and better regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.2/5">The Council adopted a resolution on the contribution of older people to economic and social development in the context of demographic change in Europe. It debated the process of open co-ordination on demography and the presidency's idea of a European Family Alliance. I emphasised the primacy of the Lisbon goals and process, and the vital importance of increasing labour supply. After a table round of very similar interventions, the presidency concluded that all delegations supported its approach. There was no need for a new process. The Lisbon Strategy and the existing Open Coordination would suffice.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.2/6">Work under the Family Alliance and the High Level Group on Demography could be accommodated within them, and that the Commission's Annual Progress Reports would assess progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.2/7">Under other business, the Council noted the annual Work Programmes of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee for 2007, and the Commission reminded members of its recent communication on the &quot;New Community strategy on health and safety at work 2007-2012&quot;, which will be raised again in May.</p>
