<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-11b.41WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" speakername="Kitty Ussher" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="41WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071011/wmstext/71011m0001.htm#07101121000085">
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/1">In a written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, the previous Economic Secretary undertook to report to Parliament on a quarterly basis on the operation of the UK's asset freezing regime. This is the fourth of these reports and covers the period July-September 2007<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/2" class="italic">Asset-Freezing Designations</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/3">In the quarter July-September 2007, the Treasury made eight domestic designations under the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/4">None of these were persons already designated under earlier orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/5">The Terrorism order and the Al-Qaeda and Taliban order provide, where appropriate, for designations to be made confidentially and with restricted circulation of notice. Six persons were designated on this basis in this quarter.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/6">Four persons were designated on the basis of closed source material provided by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/7">There were no financial sanctions listings at the EU or the UN in relation to terrorism or Al-Qaeda and the Taliban of persons with links to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/8">A total of 284 separate accounts and approximately &pound;625,000<sup>(2)</sup> of suspected terrorist funds have been frozen in the UK since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/9" class="italic">Reviews</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/10">The Treasury keeps domestic asset-freezing cases under review. A number of formal reviews have been initiated in this quarter and the review of one case was completed. In this case a decision was taken to delist the designated person.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/11" class="italic">Litigation</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/12">An application under Article 5(4) of the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 for an order to set aside a designation was lodged at the High Court on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-21">21 August 2007</phrase> by a designated person. Three other applications to set aside have subsequently been received on behalf of designated persons, who have sought to join them to the first application. A directions hearing which will cover all four cases is scheduled for 12th October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/13" class="italic">Licensing Policy</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/14">In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1452 (2002), the Treasury operates a licensing system whereby designated persons and others are able to apply to make or receive payments under specific and, if necessary, monitored conditions. In this quarter, the following licences were issued:</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/15" class="indent">11 listed persons were granted legal expenses licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/16" class="indent">13 listed persons were granted basic expenses licences; (2 of which were for benefits payments); and</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/17" class="indent">5 listed persons were granted extraordinary expenses licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/18">In addition, the households of four listed persons were granted benefits licences in accordance with the policy set out in the previous Economic Secretary's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase> to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/19" class="indent"><sup>(1 )</sup>The detail that can be provided to the House on a quarterly basis is subject to the need to avoid the identification, directly or indirectly, of personal or operationally sensitive information.</p>
	<p pid="b.41WS.2/20" class="indent"><sup>(2)</sup> This figure includes approximately $58,000 of suspected terrorist funds frozen in the UK. This has been converted using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in the exchange rate may impact on the contribution this sum makes to future totals of suspected terrorist funds frozen.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-11b.42WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" speakername="Des Browne" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="42WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071011/wmstext/71011m0001.htm#07101121000086">
	<p pid="b.42WS.2/1">A review of the multiple injury lump sum element of the armed forces and reserve forces compensation scheme has been undertaken over recent weeks. The purpose of the review was to ensure that the scheme's intent of focusing benefit on the most seriously injured was being delivered. We have concluded that, while the scheme overall remains fundamentally sound, the existing rule for multiple injuries received in a single incident was not intended for the type of multiple injury cases seen today, and that it is appropriate to reinforce the focus on the most seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.2/2">Subject to consultation, we are proposing to amend the rule so that those with multiple injuries who qualify for 100 per cent. of the guaranteed income payment (GIF), who are by definition the most seriously injured, will receive the full lump sum compensation award for each of their injuries sustained in a single incident, up to the maximum of &pound;285,000. It is also proposed that additional benefits will be conferred on those who have had their cases determined under the current rule, so that they receive the same level of compensation as those determined after the rules have been changed. Those with less serious injuries, who do not qualify for 100 per cent. GIF payments, will continue to have the current rule applied to their multiple injuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.42WS.2/3">The proposal has the full support of the service chiefs of staff. We are now consulting the members of the Central Advisory Committee, the statutory consultative body which advises on war pension and compensation issues, before finalising arrangements and making the necessary changes to the secondary legislation to put the new rule in place at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="b.45WS.1/1">My noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.1/2" class="indent">&quot;In my reply on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-23">23 July</phrase> to the below question from my noble Friend Lord Judd, I incorrectly stated that the UK's contribution to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was &pound;98 million, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-23.71"><i>Official Report</i>, column WA71</phrase>. I regret the error and my corrected answer is given below:</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.1/3" class="indent">The Lord Judd: To ask Her Majesty's Government, how many of the Iraqi refugees in Syria are thought to be the victims of torture; and what discussions they have had with the Government of Syria and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on how best to respond. HL4895</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.1/4" class="indent">The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown): The UK is not in a position to assess the numbers of Iraqi refugees in Syria that have been victims of torture. We have not had any discussions on this issue with either the UNHCR or the Government of Syria.</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.1/5" class="indent">The UK continues to support the UNHCR's leading role in providing humanitarian support to Iraq Refugees in Syria. In 2006 the UK contributed approximately US$52 million (approximately &pound;26 million) to support the work of the UNHCR worldwide, including in Syria. In addition, officials from our Embassy in Damascus have visited the UNHCR refugee reception centre in Damascus to assess the conditions there. We are now looking at supporting a range of projects aimed at improving conditions for Iraqi refugees, specifically in the areas of education and healthcare&quot;.</p>
