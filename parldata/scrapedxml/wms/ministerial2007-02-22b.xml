	<p pid="b.57WS.7/1">My right hon. and noble Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs, Baroness Ashton of Upholland, has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.7/2" class="indent">&quot;I have today laid before Parliament the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses along with the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.7/3" class="indent">The Mental Capacity Act 2005 provides a statutory framework for people who lack the mental capacity to make their own decisions. It sets out who can take decisions, in which situations, and how they should go about this. It also enables people to make provision for a time in the future when they may lack capacity to make some decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.7/4" class="indent">Section 42 of the Act requires the Lord Chancellor to prepare a Code of Practice to provide information and guidance on how the Act will work in practice. A draft version of the Code was published for full public consultation in 2006. Over 160 individuals and organisations responded and many of the suggestions and comments received have been incorporated into the final version.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.7/5" class="indent">The Act requires a range of people to have regarded to the Code, for example anyone acting in a professional or paid role in relation to someone who lacks capacity. Everyone who cares for, or makes decisions on behalf of, someone who lacks capacity will need to follow the new law when it comes into force. The Code is intended to provide valuable information and guidance to all those covered by the Act and has been written to meet the needs of this wide and varied audience.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-02-22b.59WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" speakername="David Miliband" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="59WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070222/wmstext/70222m0001.htm#07022246000123">
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/1">In my oral statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November 2006</phrase>, I announced that where full payments under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme (SPS) were not possible in the early part of 2007, partial payments for not less than 50 per cent. of claim value would start in mid-February for eligible claims above &euro;1,000. The process was expected to take around three weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/2">I can confirm that, after successful testing, full payments began in January 2007, with a total of 40,697 such payments, with a value of &pound;285.85 million, being made to date. Last week partial payments began and 43,270 partial payments with a value of &pound;633.28 million had been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/3">The combination of these full and partial payments has resulted in a total of &pound;919.13 million representing 59 per cent. of the estimated total fund of &pound;1.54 billion going to 83,967 (77 per cent.) claimants.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/4">In combination with making partial payments to the small number of claimants in the eligible group who have yet to receive one, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) will now resume full payments and begin top up payments where a partial payment has already been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/5">The claims that have yet to receive a full payment tend to be the more complex and require greater manual processing by RPA staff. Along with the fact that, in some cases, action on 2005 claims will need to be completed first, this presents continuing challenges for the RPA as it works towards meeting its target of making 96.14 per cent. of valid 2006 claims (by value) by <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. This means that while I would expect a steady flow of payments over the coming months, the pace will vary from week to week.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/6">The current position in relation to the 2005 SPS is that some 87 SPS 2005 claims had not received any payment and 92 claimants were awaiting their balance payment having already received a partial payment. This is roughly equivalent to the position that applied at a similar stage under the old Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) schemes. The RPA continues to try and complete action on these claims and is also reviewing the possible need to adjust SPS entitlement details notified to claimants. Adjustments have been made for some 8,000 claimants to date and approximately 25,000 cases are currently under review. Due to the difficulties experienced during the introduction of the scheme, further cases requiring review continue to come to light and dedicated teams are taking this work forward. In order to protect the 2006 payment timetable as far as possible, only those adjustments estimated to be above &euro;100 will be actioned before the 2006 payments are made.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/7">Looking ahead, plans are well advanced for the 2007 scheme, with application forms, containing a greater degree of pre-population than in the last two years, expected to be despatched during March.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/8">I would like to place on record my thanks both for the continued patience of the farming industry as we strive to improve delivery of the SPS and rebuild confidence in the RPA and for the staff of the agency for their hard work and commitment to making sure this happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/9">I will continue to keep the House informed of progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.64WS.4/1">I have today published a consultation paper setting out the Government's proposals for implementing the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="">17 May 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.64WS.4/2">The RTFO will require that 5 per cent. of all UK road transport fuel comes from a renewable source by 2010 in order to help meet our climate change objectives. The energy review and climate change programme review in 2006 committed the Government to consulting on the details of the scheme in early 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.64WS.4/3" class="indent">The consultation seeks views on the following issues:</p>
	<p pid="b.64WS.4/4" class="indent">The detailed design of the scheme and which suppliers will be affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.64WS.4/5" class="indent">How suppliers of renewable fuel would report on the carbon savings and wider impacts of those fuels.</p>
	<p pid="b.64WS.4/6" class="indent">How the RTFO might develop over time and the nature and level of the obligation after 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.64WS.4/7">Further information is available from the Departmental website at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/</a></p>
