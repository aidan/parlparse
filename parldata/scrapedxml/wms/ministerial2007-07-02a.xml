<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-02a.41WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="41WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070702/wmstext/70702m0001.htm#0707027000029">
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/1">My predecessors have kept the House informed of progress with the Single Payment Scheme (SPS). I intend to do likewise.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-30">30 June</phrase>, the end of the regulatory payment window for the 2006 scheme, a total of &pound;1.49 billion, representing some 98 per cent. of the estimated total fund had been paid in either full or partial payments to 107,088 (98.2 per cent.) claimants. About 2,900 claimants have received a partial payment and await the balancing sum. Work has also to be completed in respect of a further 2,000 claims, mainly small ones and those affected by legal issues such as probate. In these cases either no payment has been made to date or it has yet to be confirmed that any payment is due. Interest will be paid to claimants on sums paid after <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-30">30 June</phrase> on the same basis as for the 2005 scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/3">Given the difficulties experienced with the implementation of the scheme in 2005, the plan that my right hon. Friend, the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs set out in his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-11-07.715"><i>Official Report</i>, column 715</phrase> for 2006 SPS payments was a challenging one for the Rural Payments Agency (RPA.) I am able to report that the agency has succeeded in both making the majority of payments earlier than last year, so boosting farmers' cash-flow, and meeting its formal target of making 96.14 per cent. of payments by <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-30">30 June</phrase>. I am grateful to RPA staff who have worked long and hard to make this happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/4">There need to be further improvements in the RPA's performance, however, before it can be said that it is again providing an acceptable level of service. The next step in achieving this will be to complete work on some 20,000 2005 cases where entitlement values have been identified for review and possible adjustment, upwards or downwards, to 2005 and 2006 payments. RPA resources are now being switched to this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/5">Meanwhile, the RPA has already begun processing the 106,000 or so claims that have been submitted under the 2007 SPS. The agency's targets for 2007-08 that were set out in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" name="Barry Gardiner">the statement of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North, (Barry Gardiner)</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-26">26 June 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-06-26.20WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 20WS</phrase> include one for 2007 SPS payments that represents a greater degree of challenge for the agency in the coming year while also reflecting the fact that it is still in a recovery period. Against this background, I would like to add my thanks to the farming industry for its continuing patience and support.</p>
