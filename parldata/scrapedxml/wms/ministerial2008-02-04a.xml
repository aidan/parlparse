<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-02-04a.46WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" speakername="Hazel Blears" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government" colnum="46WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080204/wmstext/80204m0002.htm#0802041000709">
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/1">Today I am publishing the Government's response to the &quot;Commission on Integration and Cohesion&quot;. Copies of the response have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/2">In August 2006 the Government asked Darra Singh, the chief executive of Haling council, to chair a commission examining the issues of integration and cohesion&mdash;how, in the light of concerns about communities living &quot;parallel lives&quot;, of changing patterns of migration, and of new technologies transforming the way people interact with each other, Government can help build strong communities where neighbours feel at ease, share a sense of belonging, and have the opportunity to work together to shape the future of the place where they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/3">In June 2007, the Commission delivered a serious and ambitious report based on in depth consultation. It set out practical proposals for building cohesion and integration at a local level and contained a number of specific recommendations for Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/4">The report has already influenced a range of policies, changing the debate about how best to bring people of different backgrounds together and empower them to influence the decisions which affect their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/5">Today, I am pleased to set out in detail my response to all 57 of the Commission's recommendations&mdash;what we have already done, what we will do in the future and how we will further develop the Commission's ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/6">It sets out a new clarity on, and commitment to, delivering cohesive and integrated communities, backed by increased investment in cohesion of some &pound;50 million over the next three years, and a new public service agreement to drive practical action across Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/7">At the heart of the Government's approach, like the Commission's, is the principle that cohesion can only be understood and built locally. Central Government's role is to set the national framework within which local authorities and their partners can deliver improvements to cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/8">Our response sets out how we will support this local delivery through six key principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/9" class="indent">1) a move away from a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach;</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/10" class="indent">2) mainstreaming of cohesion into wider policy areas;</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/11" class="indent">3) a national framework for local support and guidance; including establishing specialist cohesion teams to provide support to local authorities facing cohesion challenges and giving local authorities a tool to assess the impact their planned activities will have on cohesion;</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/12" class="indent">4) integration of new migrants and existing communities; starting with new guidance for local authorities on developing information packs for migrants;</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/13" class="indent">5) building positive relationships; to this end we are today also publishing a consultation on &quot;Guidance for Funders&quot;, which encourages local authorities to consider how funding can be better used to support greater interaction and;</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/14" class="indent">6) sharing lessons about what works;</p>
	<p pid="a.46WS.2/15">I am grateful to Darra Singh and his Commissioners for their hard work. With this response the Government are demonstrating their commitment to maintaining the momentum the report has created and helping build stronger communities where all individuals, no matter what their background, feel a sense of shared belonging, and can work with their neighbours to shape a better future for the place where they live.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-02-04a.47WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government" colnum="47WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080204/wmstext/80204m0002.htm#0802041000710">
	<p pid="a.47WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January 2008</phrase>, the Department published a statement on its website about the local authority business growth incentives scheme:</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.1/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/Finance/labgi/statemtyr3pay.pdf">www.local.communities.gov.uk/Finance/labgi/statemtyr3pay.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.1/3">This indicated that, following further consideration of the new legal challenges that have been made against the current LABGI scheme and the inherent uncertainty this causes to the remaining LABGI pot, the Government intended to reconsider all aspects of the approach used to distribute resources available for Year 3 of the LABGI scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.1/4">Alongside our reconsideration of the Year 3 scheme, the Government have reconsidered the payments for Years 1 and 2 of LABGI, which were made on the basis of a number of Valuation Office Agency rateable value &quot;change codes&quot;. We have taken the view that there are a number of Valuation Office Agency change codes that have not previously been used in LABGI calculations, which could contain elements of business growth. In light of this, and to avoid the additional delay and uncertainty caused by further legal challenge, the Government proposes to reward authorities on the basis of a wider set of codes than has so far been the case for Years 1 and 2. I will set out the details shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.1/5">The Government are still finalising its analysis of options for allocating the resources available for Year 3 of the scheme. We continue to be convinced of the value of providing incentives to encourage business growth, a view echoed by the great majority of the responses to our recent issues paper on the reform of the LABGI scheme, &quot;Building Better Incentives for Local Economic Growth: Reforms to the Local Authority Business Growth Incentives Scheme&quot;. We also remain determined to try to achieve this policy aim for LABGI. However, the inclination of a small number of authorities to pursue legal action has created greater complexity, uncertainty and delay. Given this, it will be necessary to retain a portion of the Year 3 funding as a contingency in this final year of the current scheme. I will make an announcement on Year 3 methodology and the size of the contingency retained as soon as possible.</p>
