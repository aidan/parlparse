<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-23a.21WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="21WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091123/wmstext/91123m0001.htm#0911233000071">
	<p pid="a.21WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-18">18 November 2009</phrase>, I represented the UK at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Budget ECOFIN).</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.2/2">Finance Ministers agreed to adopt Preliminary Draft Amending Budget 10 (as updated by the Commission and amended during the course of negotiations) to the 2009 EC Budget. This amends the 2009 Budget to reflect latest implementation capacity, thus reducing the level of funding required from member states in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.2/3">Finance Ministers agreed to adopt amending letter 2 to the Commission's preliminary draft Budget for 2010, as amended during the negotiations. This included the latest information on agricultural market prices and other developments, support to nuclear decommissioning in Bulgaria and additional provisions for dairy sector support. In parallel, Finance Ministers also agreed to adopt the Commission's proposal to amend the inter-institutional agreement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May 2006</phrase> as regards the multi-annual financial framework, again as amended during the negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.2/4">During a conciliation meeting between the Council and the European Parliament, agreement was reached on the 2010 EC Budget and to finance the outstanding &euro;2.4 billion tranche of the European economic recovery plan, in full, with no increase to the 2007-2013 financial framework. Financing was secured through a substantial reduction to the agriculture heading ceiling and smaller reductions to other ceilings including administration. This was matched by a corresponding increase to the spending ceiling for the Budget's competitiveness for growth and employment heading.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.2/5">The agreement establishes total payment levels of &euro;122,937 billion (1.04 per cent. of EU GNI). The European Parliament is scheduled to vote on its own Second Reading between 14 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-17">17 December</phrase>, after which the 2010 EC Budget will be formally adopted. By working with our like-minded partners the Government secured a 2010 budget that was &euro;4.6 billion (4 per cent.) lower than that proposed by the European Parliament and lower than the Commission's proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.2/6">Four joint statements relating to the Budget were also agreed at Budget ECOFIN. These concerned: the continuity of the 2010 budgetary procedure, the simplification and more targeted use of structural funds in the context of the economic crisis, EU buildings policy and the administration heading in 2010. The Government are supportive of these statements, which reaffirm the importance of community assistance through the structural and cohesion funds, and call for sound financial management and budget discipline in key areas of concern.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-23a.23WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health" colnum="23WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091123/wmstext/91123m0001.htm#0911233000074">
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/1">I am today placing in the Library the Government response to Dr. Steve Boorman's review into &quot;NHS health and well-being&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/2">Dr. Boorman was commissioned by the former Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1648" name="Alan Johnson">the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)</phrase>. following Dame Carol Black's review of the health of Britain's working age population: &quot;Working for a healthier tomorrow&quot;. His review also supports the commitment to NHS staff in the NHS constitution that: &quot;The NHS commits to provide support and opportunities for staff to maintain their health, well-being and safety&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/3">Dr. Boorman, supported by his independent review team, has engaged widely with NHS stakeholders and has gathered and analysed a large amount of evidence about staff health and well-being in the NHS. He makes 20 recommendations to improve staff health and well-being, which we welcome and fully support and accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/4">Improving health and well-being is one of the staff pledges in the NHS constitution and Dr Boorman's report contributes to the case for staff engagement and well-being as vital if the NHS is to meet the quality and productivity challenge. Dr. Boorman's report emphasises the impact of staff health and well-being on the quality of care that they give patients. Organisations that have better staff health and well-being indicators also have better patient satisfaction scores.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/5">In terms of productivity, the business case for reducing sickness absence is unquestionable: there are 10.7 million days lost to sickness absence each year in the NHS-at a cost of &pound;1.7 billion. Dr. Boorman proposes that the NHS could-as a whole-reduce sickness absence by one third and save the NHS &pound;550 million a year. This has been achieved by other large organisations following strategic health and well-being initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/6">Dr. Boorman's findings demonstrate clearly to the NHS that investing in staff health and well-being will reap long-term benefits. NHS organisations need to be exemplars in promoting the health and well-being of their staff. By doing this, they support the NHS to play its key role in promoting public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/7">I expect NHS organisations to take action to implement the recommendations in the Boorman report. They will be supported by national and regional action to ensure system incentives support delivery of the changes needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/8">Dr. Boorman's report, &quot;NHS health and well-being&quot;, and the Government's response have been placed in the Library and copies are available to hon. Members from the Vote Office.

	<p pid="a.24WS.2/1">I am publishing today the Government Olympic Executive's Quarterly Economic Report-&quot;London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Quarterly Economic Report November 2009&quot;. This report explains the latest budget position as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase>, and outlines some of the many wider economic benefits to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.2/2">The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games remain on time and within budget. The overall &pound;9.325 billion public sector funding package for the London 2012 games remains unchanged. Within this there has been some movement in the anticipated final cost (AFC) of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) programme which, as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September</phrase>, was &pound;7.241 billion compared to &pound;7.234 billion at the end of the last quarter (<phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June</phrase>), against the maximum funding available of &pound;8.1 billion. This is a consequence of the potential requirement for upgrading local facilities for games-time training venues and increases in cost pressures. Savings have also been made on areas including site preparations and logistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.2/3">The majority of contingency remains unreleased and the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) continues to make strong progress in preparing the venues and infrastructure in the Olympic park. The external structure of the main stadium is complete as is the roof structure of the aquatics centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.2/4">The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games are continuing to help businesses and people through the recession. More than 1,000 companies have won direct contracts from ODA worth more than &pound;5 billion and, as of September 2009, a total of 7,270 people were working on the Olympic park and village. Ten per cent of these workers are undertaking a traineeship, apprenticeship or work placement.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.2/5">I would like to commend this report to the Members of both Houses and thank them for their continued interest in and support for the London 2012 games.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.2/6">Copies of the &quot;Quarterly Economic Report November 2009&quot; are available at: <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a> and will be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
