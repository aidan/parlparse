	<p pid="a.55WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-11">11 October</phrase> I chaired the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Luxembourg. The Paymaster General, right hon. Dawn Primarolo MP, represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.2/2">The Presidency expressed the Council's sympathy, solidarity and support to all those affected by the terrible earthquake which hit south Asia earlier this month, and the willingness as a community and as national Governments to provide assistance as required to alleviate the consequences of this humanitarian disaster and assist reconstruction.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.2/3">The Council took note of the Commission's intention to propose the next step in Hungary's Excessive Deficit Procedure in due time for the <phrase class="date" code="">8 November</phrase> ECOFIN meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.2/4">The Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) briefed the Council on progress in developing EU support for the economic regeneration of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in cooperation with other countries and institutions working in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.2/5">The Commission reported on progress towards the implementation of the June EU-US Summit Economic Declaration. The Presidency, supported by the forthcoming Austrian and Finnish Presidencies, concluded that there was broad support for closer EU-US economic cooperation and that ECOFIN would return to the issue ahead of the 2006 EU-US summit.</p>

	<p pid="a.55WS.2/7">Council Conclusions were agreed on the Commission's Green Paper Financial Services Policy (2005&ndash;10). Member States reached consensus on the need for effective implementation and enforcement of current measures, the importance of recognising the global nature of financial markets, the need to embed better regulation principles into financial services policy moving forward, as well as the growing importance of non-legislative instruments, such as competition policy, in future policy-making.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.2/8">The chairmen of the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors (CEIOPS) and the Committee of the European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), briefed the Council on the work they are undertaking to improve the quality of European financial legislation, and cooperation between supervisors, underlining their commitment to the better regulation agenda.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-10-19a.58WS.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" speakername="Peter Hain" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland" colnum="58WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051019/wmstext/51019m02.htm#51019m02.html_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.58WS.7/1">I have received the Seventh Report of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). This report has been made under Articles 4 and 7 of the International Agreement that established the Commission and it reports on levels of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. I have considered the content of the report and I am today bringing it before Parliament. I have placed copies in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.7/2">The report concludes that the PIRA statement, despite coming at a point when five sixths of the period under review had elapsed, is 'very significant'. The statement and the act of decommissioning reported by the IICD on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-26">26 September</phrase> have created a platform for future progress and 'initial signs following the PIRA statement are encouraging'. However, it is essential that the IMC, as they state, are able to observe 'cumulative changes in behaviour over a more sustained period of time . . . '. I await the next report of the Commission, due in January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.7/3">In the meantime I have decided to restore Sinn Fein's Assembly allowances, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>, and will, in due course, recommend to the House that it lifts the suspension of allowances to Sinn Fein Members of Parliament, which took effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.7/4">The report also concludes that paramilitaries, especially Loyalists and dissident Republicans, continue to exert a malign influence over communities which has obstructed the development of a 'culture of lawfulness'. As I said in my Statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-14">14 October</phrase>, it has taken a long time for the Republican movement to acknowledge that violence does not pay but it has now publicly done so. Loyalist paramilitaries must now also realise that exclusively peaceful and democratic means represent the sole way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.7/5">Once again, I am grateful to the Commission for their submission of this report and for its careful analysis.</p>
