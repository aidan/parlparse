	<p pid="a.3WS.2/1">I was unable to attend the Council because of Cabinet business in London. Andy Lebrecht, Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU, represented the UK at the Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/2">The extraordinary Energy Council began with a report by the Energy Commissioner of the impact of events in north Africa and Japan on the EU's energy market. Although there had been no significant impact on supplies as a result of events in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, there had been an impact on prices. The EU had 120 days of oil supply. Saudi Arabia and Russia had undertaken to cover any shortfalls in gas and oil supplies. There was general agreement that oil and gas markets were functioning well and that it was important to take a calm approach to reassure the market. The Council concluded that although there was no immediate problem with energy supply, the EU should take measures to increase its ability to deal with problems in the future, in line with the priorities agreed at the European Energy Council on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-04">4 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/3">The Commissioner then reported on the situation in Japan; and on the role of nuclear in the energy mix of the EU. He noted the right of member states to decide upon their own energy mix and that nuclear would continue to play a large role in the EU for the foreseeable future. He proposed that member states should work together to develop and approve an EU safety check for nuclear power plants. The UK agreed on the importance of a measured response based on the evidence and on lessons learned from the events in Japan. Most member states supported this position.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.2/4">The Council concluded that the EU response to the situation in Japan should involve comprehensive risk and safety assessments (&quot;stress tests&quot;) of nuclear power plants in Europe with full involvement of member states in determining how this should be done. EU neighbouring countries should also be involved in the assessment, as well as international bodies such as the G20 and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The EU should maintain high standards of nuclear safety, with a continual process of improvement. The Council agreed that communication with the public on these issues should be open and transparent.</p>

	<p pid="a.5WS.5/1">My hon. Friend, the Under-Secretary of State, responsible for welfare reform, Lord Freud of Eastry, has made the following statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.5/2">The Government announced in last October's comprehensive spending review that it would extend the housing benefit shared accommodation rate to people under the age of 35 from 2012. This rate currently applies to people under the age of 25 and reflects the costs of renting non-self-contained accommodation in the private sector where the tenant has exclusive use of a bedroom but shares other facilities such as a bathroom.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.5/3">We intend to bring forward these changes by three months so that they start to take effect from January 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.5/4">The local housing allowance reforms, to be introduced from this April, cap the level of payments to a maximum of a four bedroom rate and reduce local housing allowance rates so that they are based on the 30th percentile of rents rather than the median. They also introduce overall caps on the rate of local housing allowance for one, two, three and four-bedroom accommodation. Existing customers will be given up to nine months transitional protection from these reforms starting from the anniversary date of their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.5/5">By introducing the shared accommodation rate changes slightly earlier, this will bring the timing of the shared accommodation rate change more closely into line with the local housing allowance reforms for existing customers. It will ensure that single people aged 25 to 34 reaching the end of their transitional protection period will experience at that point a single reduction in their housing benefit, rather than two separate reductions.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.5/6">That is why we have decided to bring forward the shared accommodation rate changes. We will publicise these proposed changes through appropriate channels to make sure that those affected are aware of them in advance.</p>
