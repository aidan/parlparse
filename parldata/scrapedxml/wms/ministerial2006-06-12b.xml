	<p pid="b.46WS.4/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council met on 1-<phrase class="date" code="2006-06-02">2 June</phrase>. The health issues were taken on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-02">2 June</phrase>. Items on the main agenda were: the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners and Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs; women's health; promotion of healthy lifestyles and prevention of type 2 diabetes; common values and principles in EU health systems; review of the EU strategy for sustainable development; pandemic influenza preparedness and planning; combating HIV/AIDS; the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on advanced therapy medicinal products and amending Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004; and the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC and Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and the Council as regards the review of the medical devices directives.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.4/2">The Council adopted the amendments to the additives and sweeteners directives by qualified majority voting. The UK voted in favour of these.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.4/3">Council conclusions were adopted on women's health and promotion of healthy lifestyles and prevention of type 2 diabetes.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.4/4">Council conclusions were also adopted on common values and principles in EU health systems. The UK expressed particular support for these, which build on conclusions agreed under the Irish Presidency in 2004, reminding the European institutions of the importance of safeguarding the values and principles that underpin EU health systems in their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.4/5">There was a policy debate on the review of the EU sustainable development strategy. Key themes included: recognition that improved health contributes to economic growth; addressing health inequalities; and the importance of the global dimension in promoting health in less developed countries. The UK spoke about the significant role employers could play in providing healthy workplaces and the value of sharing strategies for improving mental health.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.4/6">There was an exchange of views on the Commission communication on combating HIV/AIDS within the EU and in neighbouring countries. The communication received broad support and there was wide recognition of the need to focus on prevention activities especially among at-risk groups. The UK emphasised the need for the EU to take HIV/AIDS into account in its near neighbourhood policies and funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.4/7">There was a lunchtime discussion on pandemic influenza preparedness.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.4/8">The Council received information from the presidency on progress in the ongoing discussions of the Council pharmaceutical working group on the directives on advanced therapy medical products and medical devices.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.4/9">Under any other business, the Council heard a report from the Presidency on the European Parliament's vote on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-16">16 May</phrase> that allowed a second reading agreement on the proposed regulation on nutrition and health claims on food, and on the proposed regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and other substances to food. Both regulations will come back to Council for adoption once the administrative processes to ensure legal and linguistic consistency have been completed.</p>

	<p pid="b.47WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May</phrase> Roche, the manufacturers of Herceptin (Trastuzumab), announced that the European Commission had granted a licence extension for Herceptin to include use in patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June</phrase>, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published its draft guidance on Herceptin. This recommends the drug for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, except where there are concerns about cardiac function. The full draft recommendations are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/3" class="indent">1.1 Trastuzumab, given at three week intervals for one year or until disease recurrence (whichever is the shorter period), is recommended as a treatment option for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable).</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/4" class="indent">1.2 Cardiac function should be assessed prior to the commencement of therapy and trastuzumab treatment should not be offered to women who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55 per cent or less, or who have any of the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/5" class="indent">a history of documented congestive heart failure;</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/6" class="indent">high-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias;</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/7" class="indent">angina pectoris requiring medication;</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/8" class="indent">clinically significant valvular disease;</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/9" class="indent">evidence of transmural infarction on electrocardiograph (ECG);</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/10" class="indent">poorly controlled hypertension.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/11" class="indent">1.3 Cardiac functional assessments should be repeated every three months during trastuzumab treatment. If the LVEF drops by 10 per cent. from baseline and to below 50 per cent. then trastuzumab treatment should be suspended. A decision to resume trastuzumab therapy should be based on a further cardiac assessment and a fully informed discussion of the risks and benefits between the individual patient and their clinician.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/12">These recommendations are subject to an appeal period which closes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-28">28 June 2006</phrase>. During this period, registered stakeholder organisations including those representing healthcare professionals, patients and carers can appeal against the draft guidance. Final guidance is expected to be issued at the beginning of July 2006, assuming there are no appeals.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/13">Once finalised, the recommendations will mean that all eligible patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer should receive Herceptin on the NHS. Although the recommendations are subject to appeal, there are no national restrictions on the NHS using Herceptin in the interim and the draft recommendations should, of course, be taken into account by Primary Care Trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/14">I would like to congratulate NICE on issuing its draft recommendations on Herceptin just two weeks after the drug was licensed for use in early-stage breast cancer. This shows how the new single technology appraisal process allows NICE to issue guidance within weeks of a licence being granted.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/15">The important thing now is for NHS cancer networks to ensure that all women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer receive a HER2 test to determine if they are HER2-positive and might therefore benefit from treatment with Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="b.47WS.1/16">Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director, is already working with cancer networks to ensure that testing arrangements are put in place. I am expecting an update from Professor Richards next week and I will ensure that both Houses receive a report on progress soon afterwards.</p>

	<p pid="b.49WS.2/1">I informed hon. Members on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March</phrase> of the official launch of the United Nations (UN) Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). The CERF is intended to provide UN humanitarian agencies with early funding so that they can respond immediately when a crisis strikes, and to enable them to channel funds to neglected emergencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.2/2">To date, the CERF total stands at $262 million from 42 donors, of which the UK is the largest single contributor with $70 million (&pound;40 million) for this first year of operation. The CERF has made an encouraging start, with $92 million committed to a number of humanitarian crises, the largest allocations of which are going to the Horn of Africa ($25 million); Darfur ($20 million); the Democratic Republic of Congo ($17 million); Chad ($10 million); Niger ($6 million); Cote D'lvoire ($2 million); and Burundi ($2 million).</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.2/3">The UK has a seat on the CERF Advisory Group, which provides the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator with advice on the speed and appropriateness of fund allocations, and examines performance and accountability. The Group had its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.2/4">In the light of the CERF's encouraging start, and as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the quality and quantity of the UK's response to humanitarian crises, I am pleased to inform the House that I have approved a further commitment to the CERF of &pound;120 million over the next three years (January 2007 to December 2009), which is conditional on DFID continuing to be satisfied with the results that the UN is achieving with the CERF. We will monitor the performance of the CERF closely to ensure this investment is used to the best effect. I hope that this long-term commitment will encourage other donors to do likewise, thereby strengthening the financial sustainability of the CERF, and we will be actively lobbying key donors to this end.</p>
