<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27a.9WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" speakeroffice="The Minister for Competitiveness" colnum="9WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071127/wmstext/71127m0001.htm#07112768000267">
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/1">In the Fourth Cohesion Report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-30">30 May 2007</phrase>, the European Commission assesses the impact of cohesion policy at community, national and regional levels in the European Union. The report also identifies a range of challenges that cohesion policy may be confronted with in the coming years and puts forward a set of questions for consultation. The consultation was formally launched at the Fourth Cohesion Forum in Brussels, held on the 27-<phrase class="date" code="2007-09-28">28 September 2007</phrase>, which I attended and will close on <phrase class="date" code="">31 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/2">Cohesion policy is supported by actions at EU, national, regional and local levels. The consultation is not therefore solely about the Structural and Cohesion Funds (SCFs) which have new objectives for the 2007-13 period.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/3">The SCFs are, however, a significant part of the EC budget, on which the Commission has recently published a Communication: &quot;Reforming the Budget, Changing Europe&quot;, also for public consultation, to prepare for the Budget review in 2008-09. According to the Communication, the Commission's approach is one of openness and with nothing ruled in and nothing ruled out: it will prepare this review with no preconceptions and encourages all interested parties to contribute to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/4">The Government are considering their approach both to the Commission's consultation on the future of cohesion policy and to the budget review process.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/5">In considering the Cohesion report the Government will be looking at:</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/6" class="indent">The aims of Cohesion policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/7" class="indent">The most efficient mechanisms for achieving these aims</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/8">The Government's view on the EC budget is that it should be reformed so that the EU is better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Its approach is set out in the recent publication &quot;Global Europe: Meeting the Economic and Security Challenges, October 2007&quot; publication. This identifies budgetary reform as one of the priority areas for EU action and sets out the three principles that will guide the Government's approach when considering how to achieve budgetary reform. Based on these principles, a priority for reform in the future will be &quot;a significant increase in the percentage of Structural and Cohesion Funds (SCFs) spent on poorer Member States&quot;. This is consistent with the policy direction set out in the Government's March 2003 publication &quot;A modern regional policy for the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/9">The Government encourage interested parties in the UK to respond directly to the Commission on the Cohesion report. We would also be interested in their views.</p>

	<p pid="a.10WS.2/1">I am announcing today levels of funding to local authorities to support the implementation of ContactPoint and providing an update on the implementation timetable.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/2">Some &pound;40 million will be made available to support local implementation until March 2009, made up of the following elements:</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/3" class="indent">&pound;27 million to local authorities in England, from April 2008 to March 2009, to support implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/4" class="indent">&pound;l million from April 2008 to March 2009 to support national partners' ContactPoint implementation projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/5" class="indent">A further &pound;12 million, from January 2008 made available to lead organisations to support modifications to case management systems. This will enable the main existing systems to provide data to ContactPoint and/or for authorised users to be able to have one-way access to ContactPoint via those systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/6">We have also provided indicative funding allocations to local authorities for future years: &pound;27 million in 2009-10 and &pound;15 million in 2010-11. My officials will write to local authorities and national partners today to inform local authorities and other partners about this funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/7">ContactPoint is a key element of the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; programme to transform children's services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. ContactPoint will provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/8">ContactPoint will be a simple basic online tool containing:</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/9" class="indent">minimal identifying information for each child; name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details for parents or carers. Each child will also have a unique identifying number;</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/10" class="indent">contact details for the child's educational setting and GP practice and for other practitioners or services working with them; and</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/11" class="indent">an indication as to whether a service or practitioner holds an assessment under the Common Assessment Framework or whether they are a lead professional for that child.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/12">No case information will be held on ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/13">ContactPoint is being developed with extensive input from a wide range of stakeholders. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/14" class="indent">delivery partners&mdash;local authorities and national partners (for example, voluntary and community sector organisations);</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/15" class="indent">practitioners and managers from across children's services, and bodies that represent them; and</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/16" class="indent">children, young people and parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/17">Over the last few months we have been considering the substantial stakeholder feedback we have received and looked at the implications that the resulting proposed changes could have on the system. It is clear from the considerable work we have done so far that we will need more time than we originally planned to address the changes to ContactPoint which potential system users suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/18">The change to the timetable will mean that deployment of ContactPoint to the 'Early Adopters' local authorities and national partners will be in September or October 2008. It will be deployed to all other local authorities and national partners in 2009, between January and May, depending on final deployment slots. The additional time available presents a number of opportunities to do more work in the period prior to ContactPoint deployment that will help to realise some benefits earlier. The fundamental design of ContactPoint will not change; the alterations will make sure the system works even more effectively for users and improves the ability of local authority ContactPoint teams to manage user access.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/19">The news on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase> of the loss of large volumes of child benefit data from HMRC has raised questions about the safety of large scale personal data in other Government systems, including ContactPoint. ContactPoint will not contain any financial information (such as bank details) or case information (such as case notes, assessments, medical records, exam results or subjective observations).</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/20">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>, the Department conducted an assessment of how personal data are stored and protected in the Department. As a result of that assessment, I am confident that we have very robust procedures in place. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">Wednesday 21 November</phrase>, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all Departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. To this end, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided to commission an independent assessment of its security procedures. This will be undertaken by Deloitte. Delaying the implementation of ContactPoint will enable the independent assessment of security procedures to take place as well as address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users have told us they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.2/21">Delivery partners will receive further information early in the new year. In the meantime, progress will be reported to local project managers regularly through their ContactPoint implementation co-ordinators. They will work with individual authorities and national partners to agree new deployment slots as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.11WS.2/1">In the white paper &quot;Planning for a Sustainable Future&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May 2007</phrase>, we set out a wide-ranging package of proposals for reform of the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/2">Planning is critical to protecting the countryside and our environment, building sustainable homes and communities, and supporting growth and prosperity. It also plays a vital role in ensuring individuals and local communities have a say in what gets built.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/3">Since 1997 we have made major improvements to town and country planning: more houses are being built, with better use of brownfield land; more development in town centres is helping to revitalise our towns and cities; planning decisions are being made quicker; and we have made the system more efficient and customer focused.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/4">But significant problems remain. The planning system remains too complex, bureaucratic and inefficient. These problems are particularly acute for major infrastructure projects, which are subject to different planning regimes. Currently a single project may require consent under numerous different regimes. Lack of clarity in national policy, poor preparation of specific project proposals, lengthy and adversarial inquiry processes and slow decision-making mean that some planning decisions have taken years.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/5">These delays, combined with the lack of certainty in the system, can result in high costs for business; prolonged uncertainty and blight for communities; and pose a serious threat to UK competitiveness, growth and jobs. Moreover delays in the provision of essential infrastructure needed to ensure clean, secure energy and water supplies and decent transport have quality of life implications for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/6">We need to ensure that the planning system enables us to meet the long-term challenges we face as a society:</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/7" class="indent">to meet our climate change objectives by speeding up the shift to renewable and low carbon energy, supporting the development of low and zero carbon homes and businesses; and ensuring development is resilient to the impacts of climate change;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/8" class="indent">to achieve our target of 3 million new homes by 2020 so current and future generations have access to a decent home at a price they can afford;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/9" class="indent">to enable us to meet the challenge of globalisation by being efficient and responsive to business needs; and supporting the development of vital infrastructure, such as ports, roads and airports, needed to ensure that the UK continues to attract investment and jobs;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/10" class="indent">to provide certainty for investment in new infrastructure such as power stations, gas storage facilities and electricity networks need to ensure energy supplies are secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/11">Our proposals for planning reform are a central part of the Government's wider agenda for addressing these long term challenges in a way which demonstrates our commitment to achieving a prosperous economy and high quality of life for all; while also reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/12">The white paper proposed that we should establish a new, single consent regime for nationally significant transport, energy, water and waste infrastructure projects under which:</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/13" class="indent">The Government will set out in national policy statements the case for nationally significant infrastructure, integrating social, economic and environmental policies. These statements will be subject to thorough public consultation, appraisal of sustainability and parliamentary scrutiny;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/14" class="indent">Developers will be required to consult local communities and other key stakeholders as they prepare those projects and before they submit an application;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/15" class="indent">Decisions on applications will be made by an independent Infrastructure Planning Commission using streamlined inquiry procedures. Inquiries and decisions would be subject to statutory timetables.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/16">Responses to the white paper have indicated that there is clear agreement that the current system is not working effectively. Our proposals have been widely welcomed including by business and many in the planning community and local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/17">However a number of issues and concerns have been raised. Questions have arisen in particular about:</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/18" class="indent">how we propose to take forward the proposals for national policy statements;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/19" class="indent">the need to ensure sustainable development is central to the new regime;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/20" class="indent">ensuring people can influence and participate in policy and decisions;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/21" class="indent">ensuring decisions are fair and accountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/22">The proposal to produce national policy statements for major infrastructure sectors has been welcomed by the large majority of respondents to the White Paper. Over the forthcoming months, my colleagues the Secretaries of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, for Transport, and for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will set out further details of how they propose to ensure national policy in their infrastructure sectors is clearly set out; a short summary of proposals is at Annex A.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/23">We acknowledge that it is essential to ensure that our objectives in relation to sustainable development are central to consideration of future infrastructure needs. The Bill will therefore include a duty on Ministers to ensure that national policy statements are drawn up with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. We will also make it a requirement that all national policy statements should be subject to an appropriate appraisal of the sustainability of the policy they set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/24">The Bill will also put effective public consultation and participation at the heart of all three key stages in the regime:</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/25" class="indent">By creating a clear duty to ensure effective public consultation on national policy statements. We intend that this consultation should include positive and proactive means of engaging citizens and communities. Where national policy statements identify locations or potential locations for development, there will be a duty to consult in those locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/26" class="indent">By placing clear legal obligations on developers to consult local communities before they submit a planning application, and ensure that this consultation is of high quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/27" class="indent">By making planning inquiries accessible and ensuring peoples' rights to be heard are protected. In particular the Bill will make it clear that any person who registers an interest can give oral evidence at relevant stages of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/28">In order to support more effective engagement with communities and hard-to-reach groups, we will be increasing the resources we provide to bodies that promote community engagement in planning. We also intend that local authorities should have an important role in ensuring the views of the communities they represent are fully reflected.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/29">Finally, the Bill will strengthen accountability and ensure decision-making is fair and transparent:</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/30" class="indent">Government Ministers will be clearly accountable for setting overall policy. There will be a clear distinction between responsibility for setting policy, and responsibility for the quasi-judicial decisions;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/31" class="indent">Parliament will have a stronger role in scrutinising national policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/32" class="indent">The Infrastructure Planning Commission will be required to take decisions within a clear framework of legal duties set by Parliament and policy set by Government. It will also be subject to requirements designed to ensure full accountability to Ministers, Parliament and the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/33">To provide the stronger role for Parliament, we encourage the House to establish a new Select Committee with the main purpose of holding inquiries into draft national policy statements in parallel with public consultation. We suggest that this Committee should be comprised of members from existing Select Committees on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, on Transport and on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/34">We will consider the Committee's reports together with responses to public consultation and revise draft national policy statements where appropriate, before designating them. In addition, if the Committee has recommended that a national policy statement raises issues which should be debated by Parliament as a whole, we will make available time in each House for a debate before we designate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/35">This model&mdash;in which decisions are taken independently, on an objective basis, by a body with no role in promoting particular policy outcomes&mdash;offers clear benefits in terms of increased transparency and certainty to both applicants and the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/36">We have noted concerns that the White Paper may have defined too narrowly the matters the IPC may take into account in reaching decisions. We are clear that the national policy statement should be the primary policy consideration for the Commission. However we agree that the Commission must be able in taking decisions to have discretion to take account of all information specific to the case before it which it considers relevant and important to its decision, including all such local impacts. The Bill will make it clear that this is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/37">We have also concluded that there may be some very exceptional circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to leave final decisions to the Commission. These circumstances would arise where new issues or evidence are raised relevant to an application before the Commission which are so significant that the Government consider they may justify a change of national policy. Where this was the case, the relevant Secretary of State could direct the Commission to suspend consideration of the application until he or she had reviewed the national policy statement. However where there is an application before the IPC which needs to be determined urgently in the national interest, the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to direct the IPC to produce a recommendation with the final decision to be taken by the Minister. We would expect such cases to be very rare so the Bill will therefore set out clearly the conditions that will apply to the exercise of this power.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/38">Overall we believe that our proposals for major infrastructure will reduce the average time taken for large applications by a half. By doing so, they will save between &pound;3.8 billion and &pound;4.8 billion in costs up to 2030. And they will do this while extending our commitment to ensure sustainable development is at the heart of planning; strengthening opportunities for public consultation and engagement; and improving accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/39">In addition to our proposals for reform of major infrastructure, the Bill will include a number of significant measures aimed at ensuring that the town and country planning better supports housing growth and climate change, and is more streamlined and efficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/40">The Bill will implement our proposals to introduce a new charge, entitled the Community Infrastructure Levy, to enable local authorities to secure a bigger contribution from developers towards the costs of infrastructure. We are pleased that our proposals have been widely welcomed by developers and local government. We will publish further details of the proposals on my Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/41">Local plans have a key part to play in enabling local authorities to set a clear strategic vision for their communities. The Bill will therefore include a number of provisions to make plan-making simpler and more flexible, which will be supported by a revised planning policy statement. It will also include a new duty on local authorities to take action on climate change through local plans. This duty will be underpinned by a new planning policy statement on climate change which we will publish before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/42">Finally, the Bill will include provisions to reduce the number of planning applications, speed up appeals and simplify the tree preservation order system. It will include provisions which would enable local member review bodies to determine appeals.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/43">These provisions in the Bill will be supported by a range of measures to make it easier for homeowners to extend their homes and to install microgeneration technology, to introduce new planning performance agreements which will ensure large applications are dealt with effectively, and to allow an increase in fees for planning applications in order to enable local authorities to improve the quality of service they provide. We also intend to consult on a new planning policy statement on economic development before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/44">Further details of these and other reforms are set out in the Government's summary of responses to the White Paper consultation, published today and which has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and to the related consultations which will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/45">The Planning Bill will play a key part in delivering on this Government's long-term vision for Britain. Alongside legislation on Housing and Regeneration, Climate Change, Energy and Local Transport this Bill will help to deliver our objectives in relation to housing, climate change, energy security, transport provision, and prosperity and quality of life for all. The Planning Bill will do this by ensuring that we have an efficient planning system which produces fair and transparent outcomes on decisions which are vital both to the local communities they most affect, and to the long term challenges facing us as a nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/46">Annex on National Policy Statements</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/47" class="italic">Energy</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/48">The Government will publish an overarching national policy statement covering key elements of energy policy relevant to infrastructure provision, such as climate change, security of supply and the energy market, and including information relevant to likely future demand and measures to secure energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/49">Energy national policy statements will also be expected to encompass different forms of energy generation such as fossil fuels, renewable energy, electricity networks and gas infrastructure</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/50" class="italic">Transport</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/51">The Government's aim is to establish a suite of national policy statements that will comprise:</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/52" class="indent">a statement for aviation incorporating the 2003 Air Transport White Paper in a way which meets our proposed policy and statutory requirements for national policy statements; we are already committed to produce a further progress report between 2009 and 2011, which would provide a good opportunity to designate the ATWP in conjunction with that report;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/53" class="indent">a statement for ports, possibly incorporating international freight, based on the work already undertaken as part of the ports policy review;</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/54" class="indent">a statement for the strategic national highway and rail networks focusing primarily on the highway network, given that comprehensive plans for the rail network were published earlier this year in the HLOS and supporting rail White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/55">These statements will over time be aligned with the overarching transport strategy now under development, reflecting the cross-modal approach recommended by Rod Eddington, in order to ensure a consistent analytical and policy framework. The recent discussion document <i>Towards a Sustainable Transport System</i> sets out how the Department proposes to develop this strategy, working with transport users and other stakeholders over the period to 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/56" class="italic">Water infrastructure</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/57">The Government will set out updated policies for water supply and water quality in a new Water Strategy, Future Water, which is due to be published early in 2008. This will inform development of a new national policy statement on infrastructure development for water supply and waste water treatment for the period from 2010 to 2035. The national policy statement will also be informed by parallel to planning and price review processes such as the Water Resource Management Plans which water companies will produce and the quinquennial reviews of water company sewerage charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/58" class="italic">Waste disposal</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/59">A national policy statement on waste will set out the Government's objectives for the development of waste infrastructure for the period to 2020 and will be based substantially on the Waste Strategy for England which was published in May 2007 after extensive consultation and engagement. We expect to prepare a waste national policy statement which will draw out and, if necessary, strengthen material in the Waste Strategy to enable the IPC to make decisions on projects coming forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/60" class="italic">Offshore renewables</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/61">The EPC and the Marine Management Organisation proposed under the Marine Bill White Paper will have responsibilities for consents to offshore renewables projects of specific generating capacities. Both will operate in accordance with consistent Government policy in this area whether set out in the relevant NFS or in the marine policy statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.17WS.2/1">I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels. My right hon.

	<p pid="a.17WS.2/17">I briefed partners on recent developments, highlighting the potential impact on EU objectives for the region.

	<p pid="a.21WS.5/1">My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for intellectual property and quality attended the EU Education Council to represent the UK on behalf of DCSF and DIUS.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/2">Ministers discussed the following issues:</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/3" class="italic">European Qualifications Framework<i>&mdash;</i>Political Agreement</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/4">The Council agreed the European Parliament amendments to the EQF. These amendments were in line with the General Approach that had been agreed previously at the Education Council, and there were no additional comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/5" class="italic">Improving the Quality <i>o</i><i>f Teacher Education</i><i>&mdash;</i>Adoption of Conclusions</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/6">The conclusions are intended to help countries improve teaching standards and attract high-quality teachers into the profession. The UK was happy to support these conclusions, which were adopted without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/7" class="italic">'<i>Education and Training as a Key Driver of the Lisbon Strategy</i><i>'&mdash;</i>Adoption of Resolution</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/8">This resolution focuses on the role that education and training have to play within the Lisbon strategy, notably the role of education in the knowledge triangle, the links between education and training and other 'Lisbon' policies, and the effective use of peer learning and the open method of co-ordination. The resolution was formally adopted with no discussion, and the Commission gave information on the Joint Report of the 2010 Work Programme, a draft of which they had accepted earlier in the week.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/9" class="italic">'<i>New Skills for New Jobs</i><i>'&mdash;</i>Adoption of Resolution</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/10">This resolution emphasises the importance of anticipating skills' needs and providing opportunities for citizens to improve their skill levels to match these needs. I intervened to congratulate the presidency for this initiative, to reinforce the fact that skills have an enabling role and help Europe to compete in an increasingly globalised world, and to emphasise the importance of training those with low skills and those most at risk of social exclusion. The resolution was then adopted with no further comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/11" class="italic">'Towards a More Multilingual Europe<i>'&mdash;</i>Exchange of Views</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/12">Most Ministers welcomed this focus on multilingualism, stressing the important social and economic role it has to play within the EU. The main points raised during the discussion included the issues surrounding language training for migrants and the importance of looking beyond the EU to other important global languages. I intervened to acknowledge that the UK has not historically performed well in the teaching and learning of foreign languages, but that significant initiatives have been introduced in recent years. I stressed the importance of all languages, rather than just European languages, in fostering strong and cohesive multicultural communities. It would be a mistake to regard the languages used by long-settled communities as simply an 'immigration' issue without regard to pride in historic cultural roots.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/13" class="italic">Erasmus Mundus Action Programme (2009-13)<i>&mdash;</i>General Approach</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/14">Ministers agreed a General Approach on the new phase of the Erasmus Mundus Programme, which will see an expansion of the programme to all levels of higher education, but particularly to doctoral studies, and provide additional financial support for EU students.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/15" class="italic">Resolution on Modernising Universities<i>&mdash;</i><i>Exchange of </i><i>V</i>iews</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/16">Ministers discussed this resolution, which addresses issues around autonomy, governance, curricula and mobility and will go to the Competitiveness Council (<phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November</phrase>) for formal adoption. I supported the joint approach linking mutually reinforcing areas of university and research policy, and stressed the importance of member states committing to university reforms, which are important for both economic reasons and for the life of universities. Other Ministers reported some progress in reform but were frank about how much more was needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/17" class="italic">Student Mobility: Broadening <i>t</i><i>he Social Dimension of Erasmu</i><i>s&mdash;</i><i>Exchange of</i><i> V</i>iews</p>
	<p pid="a.21WS.5/18">This discussion saw a call from many Ministers for 'positive discrimination' in the awarding of grants, to encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate. France stated that they would work on this during their presidency. Anne Lambert, UK Deputy Permanent Representative, intervened to underline the importance of mobility in meeting the challenges of globalisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.23WS.4/4">The Government have undertaken a successful programme of work to tackle reoffending since 1997. The latest results show that we have reduced proven adult reoffending by 5.8 per cent. since 2000 against the predicted rate. Tackling reoffending is ongoing work and there is still more work to do to examine what other measures need to be in place to support offender management. The consultation paper seeks views from professionals working in the field on how the Government can capitalise on the successes to date, and continue to reduce reoffending rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/5" class="italic">Public Service Agreements (PSAs)</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/6">From April 2008, a number of new Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets will be introduced. The <i>Make Communities Safer PSA</i> includes a specific measure for reducing reoffending which focuses on the volume and seriousness of reoffending, thereby allowing us to monitor the success of our interventions with priority offender groups more closely, and reflect the impact reducing reoffending has on overall crime rates. Other PSAs are also critical&mdash;specifically <i>Drugs and Alcohol, Socially Excluded Adults, </i>and<i> Young People: A Path to Success</i>. Each of these national agreements will act as levers to further embed the reducing reoffending agenda across Government and at regional levels to support effective local delivery by partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/7" class="italic">Supporting Events</p>
	<p pid="a.23WS.4/8">The National Offender Management Service is today holding a national launch to promote the consultation. In recognition of that fact that cooperation between agencies is essential in successfully tackling reoffending alone, this event will also be used to launch the Department of Health's consultation, 'Improving Health; Supporting Justice' and a NOMS third sector action plan to build the contribution of the sector to work to reduce reoffending. Consultation events for partners in regions and Wales will follow in December and January.</p>

	<p pid="a.24WS.5/1">I will attend the second Transport Council of the Portuguese presidency which takes place in Brussels on 29-<phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/2">The Council will be asked to agree conclusions on taking forward the <i>Galileo satellite navigation programme</i>. EU Ministers concluded at the June Council that the public private partnership process had failed and that the negotiations with the prospective concessionaire should end. The Commission's subsequent proposals for taking forward the deployment through a public procurement were published in September and were presented to Ministers at the October Council. At that Council, Ministers called for an integrated decision by the end of this year. Following the agreement reached at ECOFIN on Friday on the financing of Galileo, at this forthcoming Council, Ministers will be asked to agree conclusions aimed at defining the general principles covering governance and a public sector procurement of the system. If it is the view of the majority of member states that the project should proceed, then the Government will continue to work to implement an overall management structure that ensures transparency, clear lines of governance and a clear contract between the Commission and ESA as procurement agent. The Government will also seek to ensure the maximum possible competition in procurement. This will provide opportunities for new entrants and SMEs, deliver value for money for the Community and maximum opportunities for UK industry. All these objectives are in line with the commitments given to Parliament and which were set out in the European Standing Committee debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">Monday 26 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/3">The Council will also be asked to agree conclusions on the Commission's <i>Action Plan on Freight Transport Logistics</i>. The conclusions are general in nature and give no specific commitments in respect to legislative proposals. We are generally content with the majority of the proposals in the action plan and we support the fact that the Commission has mainly opted for non-legislative measures. We have reservations however concerning the Commission's intention to consider the potential for modification of vehicle weight and dimensions under Directive 96/53/EC and to update the 2003 proposal on Inter-modal Loading Units to technical progress, both of which we believe are unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/4">There will be a policy debate on progress made on the renewed <i>EU Sustainable Development Strategy</i> adopted by the European Council in June 2006. On the basis of this debate and another conducted in the Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-30">30 October</phrase>, the presidency will prepare input to the conclusions of the December European Council. I shall draw attention to our recently published transport strategy Command Paper and stress the important contribution that EU initiatives on new car CO2 emission targets and on inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme can play in meeting UK and European climate change objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/5">The Council will be asked to reach a political agreement on two legislative proposals in <i>maritime transport</i>. First, there is a regulation on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea and inland waterways in the event of accidents (incorporating the Athens convention into EC law). The Government are keen to reach political agreement on the text of this measure. The Government are now broadly content with the proposal for a regulation in the light of the amendments made by member states in negotiation. In particular, the Government would not wish to be bound by the setting of maximum limits of compensation, but agree that member states should have the flexibility to apply the provisions of the Athens convention to domestic seagoing voyages and, together with almost all member states, agree with the European Parliament that the measure should not apply to voyages on inland waterways. Our previous concerns in respect of subsidiarity have been resolved by the changes made in negotiation. The second maritime measure is a recast directive designed to update the existing directives relating to ship inspection and survey organisations. The proposal seeks to establish mutual recognition of the certificates which the organisations issue, introduces a financial penalty system to address poor performance, and places a requirement on the organisations to create a new certification system to improve their oversight. The Government are expecting that it will be possible to reach a political agreement, although there are some drafting issues relating to the proposed financial penalty system which need refinement.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/6">In <i>road transport</i>, there will be progress reports on two proposals: a recast regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market; and a regulation on common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator. Negotiations on both of these proposals continue and we hope will go forward under the Slovenian presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/7">The Council will aim to reach a political agreement on each of three proposals <i>on rail interoperability and safety</i> which have been negotiated together. These are: a directive on interoperability of the Community rail system, combining three previous directives; a directive amending the 2004 directive on rail safety; and a directive amending the 2004 directive which established the European Rail Agency. The October Council reached a General Approach on the first two of these. The UK supports the objectives of the Commission's proposals and welcomes any initiative that improves cross-acceptance of rolling stock, and simplifies and modernises the technical part of the regulatory framework for rail. The texts being put to the Council are acceptable to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/8">The Council will aim to reach a General Approach on a directive on <i>airport charges</i>, which aims to establish a framework of common principles as to how airports determine their charges for aircraft landing, take-off and handling of passengers. As part of this, the directive requires the establishment of independent regulators. In negotiation, the UK has sought a proportionate text that does not impose unnecessary regulatory burdens on airlines or airports, and a number of amendments to this effect have been made to the draft.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/9">The Council will aim to reach Political Agreement on a recast regulation on <i>common rules for the operation of air transport services</i> in the Community (the &quot;third package review&quot;). This consolidates the three existing regulations of 1992, which established the aviation single market. The proposal seeks to update the regulations in the light of experience of the single market. The UK broadly supports the proposal, in particular on pricing and consumer protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.24WS.5/10">Two issues of <i>aviation external relations</i> are on the agenda. The Council will be asked to adopt decisions giving the Commission mandates to negotiate with Jordan on a Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement, and with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on an agreement regarding aviation security audits and inspections and related matters. The UK is content for both mandates to be granted by the Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.27WS.1/1">Today I am announcing the distribution of a package of funding of more than &pound;4 billion to improve local transport outside London over the remaining three years of the Local Transport Plan period. An indicative announcement of half of this funding package was made last year. This announcement confirms that funding is available now the comprehensive spending review has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/2">It builds on the &pound;8.5 billion provided to the 122 local transport authorities, including the six passenger transport authorities, over the last seven years for small local transport improvements and capital highways maintenance. These improvements tackle pinch points, improve integration and provide genuine alternatives to the car.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/3">The &pound;4,036 billion package consists of &pound;1.768 billion for integrated transport improvements and &pound;2.268 billion for highways capital maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/4">This capital funding is in addition to the &pound;2.3 billion made available in regional funding allocations for local authority major schemes and Highways Agency schemes of regional significance over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/5">Local transport plans have now been implemented for more than six years. Local transport authorities can be proud of the way they are creating safer, cleaner environments. They have made great progress in reducing local road casualties, improving the condition of many local road networks, providing facilities for cyclists and pedestrians and integrating of transport planning alongside that of health, education and housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/6">Alongside this year's settlement we have also confirmed financial planning guidelines (announced last year) for a specific road safety grant set up as part of the move to integrate safety cameras into the wider road safety delivery process from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. The funding totals &pound;330 million over three years&mdash;that is, &pound;110 million per year. Some &pound;286 million of this is being distributed to local authorities outside London. The remaining &pound;44 million is for London and national agencies. This funding represents a long-term commitment to fund further improvements in road safety and provides local authorities and their partners with the flexibility to implement a locally agreed mix of road safety measures that will deliver the greatest reductions in road casualties in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/7">Details of the 2008-09 to 2010-11 allocations have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and are also available at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/regional/ltp/capital/ltpsettle07/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/regional/ltp/capital/ltpsettle07/</a></p>
