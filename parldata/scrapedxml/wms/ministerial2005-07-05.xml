<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-05.3WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" speakeroffice="The Financial Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="3WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/wmstext/50705m01.htm#50705m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".3WS.2/1">In light of the judgments by Mr. Justice Crane in the case of Operation Venison on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-24">24 June</phrase> and by the Court of Appeal in the cases of Operation Hellvellyn and others on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-04">4 July</phrase>, I am announcing today that HMRC has agreed with the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) that they will oversee an investigation into the criticism in Mr. Justice Crane's judgment of actions of individual officers in Operation Venison.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/2">I can also announce that HM inspectorate of constabulary (HMIC) will begin in September a full programme of inspection to examine informant handling, controlled deliveries and disclosure, including the issues raised in the judgments of Operation Venison and Operation Hellvellyn and others.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/3">At the same time, the director of the independent Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO) is examining whether or not other cases may be affected by the court judgments.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/4">The Government take the criticisms of HMRC and HMRC officers contained in the Venison and Hellvelyn judgments very seriously. We are committed to ensuring that the issues raised in such cases are fully investigated.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/5">For this reason, and to ensure that HMRC systems and practice match the best standards of law enforcement elsewhere, I can confirm that since I informed the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-29">29 September 2004</phrase> of our intention to establish independent scrutiny arrangements for HMRC following the report of Mr. Justice Butterfield, the Government have legislated to:</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/6" class="indent">establish an independent Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office, accountable directly to the Attorney General;</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/7" class="indent">extend the remit of the Independent Police Complaints Commission to allow investigation of serious complaints and allegations against HMRC staff; and</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/8" class="indent">extend the remit of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary to investigate HMRC's lawenforcement procedures and practice.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/9">The IPCC-led investigation and the HMIC inspection that I am announcing today are the first use of this comprehensive independent scrutiny framework.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/10">These newly legislated arrangements with the IPCC, HMIC and RCPO mean HMRC is now served by a fully independent prosecutions office and is being made subject to the same standards of independent scrutiny, inspection and complaints investigation as are already established for the police.</p>
	<p pid=".3WS.2/11">This framework for external scrutiny goes further than Mr. Justice Butterfield's recommendations, so that HMRC and ministers are empowered to ensure the independent, timely and expert investigation of problems arising in serious criminal cases. Where appropriate in such cases, we will make use of these arrangements in the future.</p>

	<p pid=".4WS.1/1">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Budget that, owing to the sustained volatility in the oil market, the annual inflation only increase in main fuel duties would be deferred until <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.1/2">Following sustained pressure from G8 Finance Ministers, OPEC have committed to increasing quotas by up to 1 million barrels a day by September.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.1/3">But in the short-term uncertainty, and the risk of price volatility, remains high, with oil trading last week at above $59 per barrel.</p>
	<p pid=".4WS.1/4">The Government will not go ahead with the planned inflation increase on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September</phrase>&mdash;including for rebated oils, biofuels and road fuel gases&mdash;and will review the position again at the time of the pre-Budget report.</p>
