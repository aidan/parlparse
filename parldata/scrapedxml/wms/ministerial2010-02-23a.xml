	<p pid="a.32WS.2/1">I have arranged for copies of DEFRA's new Evidence Investment Strategy (EIS) which provides an agenda to prioritise and manage DEFRA's investment in evidence from 2010 to 2013 and beyond to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It highlights the need to focus efforts on the interlinked challenges of climate change, protecting ecosystems and developing a sustainable food supply. The strategy will ensure that DEFRA has access to the best evidence when developing and implementing policies. The strategy is available at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/evidence/science/how/strategy.htm">http://www.defra. gov.uk/evidence/science/how/strategy.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.2/2">DEFRA's Chief Scientific Adviser led a detailed review of DEFRA's evidence activities and worked in collaboration with teams across DEFRA and the evidence landscape (including the executive agencies, non departmental public bodies and key external stakeholders) to develop the strategy. The EIS will build on the progress made by DEFRA's first evidence strategy, Our approach to Evidence and Innovation for 2005-08, encouraging better use of evidence for policy-making.</p>
	<p pid="a.32WS.2/3">The strategy contains a number of recommendations including the importance of working with others, both internally and through partnerships with the research councils and other Government Departments, and developing skills, expertise and capabilities which will improve DEFRA's gathering and use of evidence.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-02-23a.36WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" speakername="David Miliband" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs" colnum="36WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100223/wmstext/100223m0009.htm#10022378001372">
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/1">I would like to update the House on recent developments in the political and humanitarian situations in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/2">Since the end of the fighting last May between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam there has been a unique opportunity for the Government to work with all communities in Sri Lanka to achieve lasting peace through genuine national reconciliation. The UK has continued to make the case that this can only come about through a fully inclusive political process to address the underlying causes of the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/3" class="italic">Elections</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/4">Following the presidential election of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-26">26 January</phrase> the Prime Minister wrote to President Rajapakse and I have spoken with Foreign Minister Bogollogama. Together with others, such as the Secretaries-General of the UN and the Commonwealth and the EU High Representative, we have urged President Rajapakse to use his new mandate to make real progress on national reconciliation. The President has made some positive comments about the need to focus on the concerns of Tamils and to discuss the devolution of powers. Setting out his plans for political reform would be a welcome next step.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/5">Election monitors and the Election Commissioner were united in declaring the result of the election valid. But they voiced concerns about aspects of the election campaign, including incidences of violence and allegations of electoral malpractice. We have been encouraging the Government to address these concerns by conducting thorough investigations into any allegations and to encourage an atmosphere of calm by reaching out to those who did not support the President. There have, however, been worrying reports of a clampdown on those who did not support President Rajapakse. The arrest of his principal challenger in the election, Sarath Fonseka, has done nothing to ease tensions. The Government needs to ensure that all detainees, including Fonseka, are treated strictly in accordance with Sri Lankan law.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/6">The next opportunity for Sri Lankans to elect their political representatives will be the Parliamentary elections that are expected to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-08">8 April</phrase>. The Prime Minister has encouraged the President to ensure that measures are in place to remove the scope for allegations of malpractice. I have underlined to Foreign Minister Bogollogama the importance of making it possible for all Sri Lankans to vote. While we welcomed the high national turnout in the presidential election of 70 per cent., this dropped to less than 30 per cent. in the north and east. An election in which all communities can select their representatives of choice could advance the prospects for genuine reconciliation.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/7">We will continue to engage with the Government and other political parties in Sri Lanka to encourage a process of political reform. In recognition of the potentially positive contribution they could make to that process, we also continue to engage with the Tamil, Muslim and Sinhalese communities based in the UK. This includes the activities of Des Browne MP, the Prime Minister's special envoy for Sri Lanka. I will be addressing the forthcoming London conference of the global Tamil Forum to encourage a forward-looking, constructive approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/8" class="italic">Accountability</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/9">The EU has made clear its view that a credible process to address alleged violations of international humanitarian law by both sides during the conflict could also contribute to the process of reconciliation. The US State Department report on the conflict in Sri Lanka and the statement by Philip Alston, the UN special rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, underline the need for a credible and independent investigation. We continue to make this clear to the Sri Lankan Government, most recently when I spoke to Foreign Minister Bogollogama earlier this month. We await with interest the findings of the committee set up by President Rajapakse to look into the State Department report.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/10" class="italic">Human Rights and GSP+</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/11">A third way in which the GoSL could encourage genuine reconciliation would be through greater promotion and protection of human rights, including media freedoms, and by tackling the culture of impunity. I have reinforced to Foreign Minister Bogollogama the importance of producing and implementing a human rights national action plan, as was agreed at the UN Human Rights Council periodic review of Sri Lanka in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-19">19 October</phrase> the European Commission published its report into Sri Lanka's compliance with three of the conventions linked to Sri Lanka being a beneficiary of the GSP+ scheme. The report was clear about Sri Lanka's failings in its implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the convention on the rights of the child. The report reinforces our concerns about the human rights situation in Sri Lanka and we share the Commission's assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-15">15 February</phrase> the UK and other member states supported the Commission's formal recommendation to withdraw GSP+ benefits from Sri Lanka. This will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-15">15 August</phrase>, six months following the date of the decision. We continue to urge the Government to engage constructively with the European Commission and to take all necessary steps to address the serious concerns highlighted in the Commission's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/14" class="italic">Humanitarian Situation</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/15">The UK's most immediate priority since the end of the conflict has been to work for an improvement in the humanitarian situation. By the end of the fighting there were over 280,000 internally displaced people in camps in the north of Sri Lanka. We have been advocating an improvement in conditions inside the camps and for IDPs to be able to return to their home areas as soon as it is safe to do so. Since September 2008, the UK, through the Department for International Development, has also allocated &#163;12.5 million to the humanitarian response.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/16">Conditions in the camps have improved and there has been progress in the return of IDPs. UN official figures estimate that as of <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-15">15 January</phrase> around 187,500 people have been released from the camps, of which 158,500 have been able to return to their home areas, while 29,000 vulnerable people have been housed with host families or in institutions. It is important that vulnerable people have been housed with host families or in institutions. It is important that IDPs continue to be able to return to their home areas as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/17">The Government's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-01">1 December</phrase> that all IDPs still in the camps would be granted freedom of movement was a positive step. However, some restrictions remain in place and we will continue to encourage the Government to ease those.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.1/18">We will continue to work with international partners and with the Sri Lankan Government to encourage progress on reconciliation, accountability and human rights as a basis for the lasting peace all Sri Lankans want and deserve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-02-23a.38WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health" colnum="38WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100223/wmstext/100223m0009.htm#10022378001373">
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/1">I am publishing today the &quot;Consultation on Services for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in England&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/2">Since 2005 the Department, the National Health Service and other key stakeholders have been working together to identify the best ways to improve care and outcomes for those people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to reduce the overall prevalence of the condition. Following this work we have developed a set of recommendations for the NHS, further action for the Department and we are now consulting with stakeholders. This document represents the final consultation stage before we publish the final strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/3">We estimate that over three million people in England live with this condition. One person dies in England of COPD every 20 minutes-a loss of about 25,000 lives every year. COPD is also the second most common cause of emergency admission and the fifth largest cause for readmission to hospital. It is also one of the most costly, in terms of acute hospital care.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/4">It has therefore become clear that we need to change our approach to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of the condition. As we have developed the strategy we have had extensive engagement with people with COPD and their carers</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/5">The strategy offers a real opportunity to make a difference to people with COPD and their carers. Successful implementation will require ongoing commitment and ambition and the engagement and involvement of all stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/6">The strategy does not define how each aspect of care should be delivered. We think services need to be sensitively planned and appropriately delivered in response to the needs of each local community. However, the strategy is designed to support local service plans within the NHS, and to complement other related national and local initiatives. This will include the clinical guidelines developed by NICE and other broader health promotion initiatives such as the national tobacco control programme. With better co-ordinated and integrated services, we can provide care that better meets the complex needs of people with COPD and meets their expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/7">Because of the magnitude of the burden of asthma, we have given separate attention to that condition within this strategy, highlighting where there are synergies in the approach to the care of these conditions and where there are differences. It also highlights some aspects of good asthma services.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/8">&quot;Consultation on Services for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in England&quot; has been placed in the Library and copies are available for hon. Members from the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/9">The consultation will run from <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-23">23 February</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-05">5 April 2010</phrase>.</p>

	EU Development Ministers Meeting (Segovia)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-02-23a.44WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for International Development" colnum="44WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100223/wmstext/100223m0010.htm#10022416000823">
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/1">The informal meeting of EU Development Ministers, organised by the Spanish presidency, took place in Segovia, Spain, on 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-18">18 February</phrase>. I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/2">The items covered were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/3" class="italic">The Millennium Development Goals Review Summit</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/4">This session focused on EU preparations for the MDGs summit in New York in September 2010. The new Development Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, and the presidency underlined the importance of the summit to galvanising support for poverty reduction before the 2015 MDG target date. The UK, alongside the Commission, a number of other member states and civil society representatives, argued that the EU should demonstrate global leadership through a comprehensive package that would include commitments to those goals most at risk, particularly maternal and child health, food security and education. The Commission welcomed the clear steer from Ministers and will reflect this in its proposals planned to be put to the May and June Foreign Affairs Councils. The overall EU position will then go to the June European Council for agreement by leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/5" class="italic">Financing for Development</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/6">I underlined the importance of honouring our EU Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments. While alternative financing mechanisms, including from the private sector, are likely to form an increasingly significant part of meeting the global development and climate challenges, ODA will remain the core contribution and our pledges must be met. I shared the UK's experience of increasing ODA to a position where we will meet the 0.7 per cent. GNI target by 2013 and there was considerable interest in our draft legislation to make this commitment a legal obligation. Several member states highlighted the challenge of meeting the targets in the current economic environment, though all member states reaffirmed the importance of the commitment. The Commission and presidency will work further on suggestions for enhancing the accountability of member states to meet their pledges including an annual review of progress by Heads of Government and delivery plans to 0.7 per cent. for member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/7">By special invitation, Norway presented on its work on combating tax evasion and tax havens. In response to the presentation and a Commission discussion paper, Ministers noted the importance of mobilising domestic resources in developing partner countries as a key step in reducing dependency on aid and harnessing finance for poverty reduction. In this context, economic growth, support to improving partner countries' tax systems, tackling illegal financial flows and corruption and addressing tax havens where noted as particularly important. The French led a call for the presidency to ensure that innovative proposals on taxation and financing were discussed by both Development and Finance Ministers given the shared interest. The Commission will draft a paper for Ministers at the May Foreign Affairs Council on enhancing work on tackling tax evasion in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/8" class="italic">More effective EU development assistance</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/9">Alongside the quantity of aid, we discussed improving the quality of that aid. The Commission presented work on the improving the complementarity and co-ordination of EU aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/10" class="italic">Transatlantic relations</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/11">The new Administrator of the United States' Agency for International Development (USAID), Dr. Shah, presented his priorities to the group. These were: a strong focus on the MDGs, particularly how technology can be deployed in support of development; maternal health; food security; and education. Dr. Shah emphasised his desire to build an effective and practical partnership with the EU on development issues, something already in evidence and underlined by the response to the Haiti earthquake. EU Ministers welcomed his appointment and pledged to take forward this important relationship on a range of issues, not least the 2010 MDG summit.</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/12" class="italic">Haiti</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/13">Ministers discussed the situation in Haiti, both in terms of immediate response and ensuring better co-ordination for the reconstruction. Edmund Mullet, UN Special Representative to Haiti, Kristalina Georgieva, the new EU Humanitarian Commissioner and Dr. Shah provided details of their own efforts and their assessment of need. I joined my EU colleagues in recognising the tireless efforts of UN staff, Commission and other aid workers in Haiti</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/14">I argued for a thorough review of the humanitarian system over the last five years, learning lessons from Haiti and other disasters and drawing up recommendations to improve future responses. This proposal gained support from a number of Ministers and this will help to build the growing consensus behind the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.44WS.2/15">I also held a series of useful bilateral meetings discussing for example reform of the humanitarian system, Haiti, the MDGs and aid financing with amongst others: Dirk Neibel, the German Development Minister, Dr. Shah of USAID and Commissioner Piebalgs.</p>

	<p pid="a.57WS.2/17" class="italic">Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.2/18">The change in the Resource Departmental Expenditure Limit arises from an increase in relation to the recording of International Financial Reporting Standards for accrued employee benefits. The increase arises from the change in staff numbers between 2008-9 and 2009-10 and planned increased amounts of annual leave carried over by staff into 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.2/19">There has been an increase in appropriation in aid for operating activities and this is offset by increased expenditure. This reflects the activities of the Women's National Commission which has been making its services available to other government departments and agencies in line with the review of the Women's National Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.2/20" class="italic">Administration Costs Limit</p>
