	<p pid="e.71WS.1/1">Today my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, and I are announcing the publication of &quot;Healthy lives, brighter futures: The strategy for children and young people's health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/2">A healthy start in life is at the heart of a happy childhood and the ability of every young person to achieve their potential and grow up well prepared for the challenges of adolescence and adulthood.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/3">Children and young people are healthier than ever before, but we now have the opportunity to go further. We need to do more to achieve world-class health outcomes and minimise health inequalities, offering services of the highest quality and an excellent experience for the young people and their families who use them.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/4">We know that we must do more to provide mothers and fathers with the support they need to give their children the best start and to help young people to make healthy choices as they grow up and take more responsibility for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/5">Our two departments have come together to produce this long-term strategy to improve health outcomes for all children and young people from pre-birth to 19. It is a direct response to the views and concerns of young people, parents and professionals working with children and families.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/6">&quot;Healthy lives, brighter futures&quot; sets out how we will work in partnership with local authorities and Primary Care Trusts and those working across children's health services to build the quality of support for families at key stages in their children's lives&mdash; during pregnancy and the early years of children's lives, for school-age children as well as young people. Our package of support for children and young people with acute and additional health needs is backed by a total of &pound;770 million funding over three years to 2010-11, the largest ever investment in these services.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/7">Investing in children's health from the early years through childhood and adolescence will benefit children, families, society and the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/8">We have met many children, young people, parents and practitioners in the process of putting this strategy together Children and young people want easier access to health services to support their psychological as well as physical health. Parents and carers want better information about what services are available locally, with better links between the services that their children use. Frontline staff want help with providing excellent, integrated health and health care services for children and families.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/9">Through &quot;High Quality Care for All: NHS Next Stage Review Final Report&quot; we set out how the NHS would meet the challenges of the 21st century. &quot;Healthy lives, brighter futures&quot; sets out how we will continue to deliver improvements in children's physical and psychological health, building on existing policies such as the &quot;National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services&quot; and the Every Child Matters reforms.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/10">The strategy builds on work already in train to improve the quality and consistency of services, support and opportunities that families and children can expect in their local area. Services already aim to promote healthy lifestyles, intervene early where health problems arise and deliver support tailored to families' needs: easily accessible support in pregnancy and early years of children's life through Sure Start Children's Centres and GP practices; helping children to take increasing personal responsibility for their health during their school years and young people to deal with the health challenges of adolescence; good access to urgent care; and specialist support for children with complex and long-term conditions, so that every child can reach their full potential.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/11">Through the strategy we are making commitments to improve this existing support for children, young people and families:</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/12" class="indent">during pregnancy and the early years of life, more health visitors, and a strengthened role for Sure Start children's centres with each centre having access to a named health visitor; further expansion of the successful family nurse partnership programme for vulnerable first-time mothers; and the development and testing of a new antenatal and preparation for parenthood programme for mothers and fathers;</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/13" class="indent">for school-age children and their families, a core health programme, the development of a 'Healthy Child Programme' to set out what services should be available to parents, children and young people from 5 to 19 with schools supporting pupils' health and wellbeing, and pilots to test the impact of extending free school meals to a greater number of pupils; and</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/14" class="indent">for young people, more opportunities for sport, access to health services that are young-people friendly, and a new campaign to increase young people's knowledge of effective contraceptive methods, backed by increased investment of around &pound;27 million a year from 2008-09 for contraceptive services in a range of settings.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/15">The strategy emphasises the need to ensure that high quality, timely and accessible support is available for children and young people with acute or additional health needs and their families. We are making new commitments to strengthen that support:</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/16" class="indent">confirmation of &pound;340 million in NHS allocations over three years to improve the experience of disabled children and their families through better access to short breaks, community equipment and wheelchair services, including &pound;30 million for palliative care and end-of-life care, in addition to the &pound;340 million revenue funding already announced by DCSF for the Aiming High for Disabled Children programme and the &pound;90 million capital funding announced in the &quot;Children's Plan&quot;; and</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/17" class="indent">we will test innovative approaches to the provision of community equipment and make sure that by 2010 all children with complex health needs have individual care plans to support co-ordinated care.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/18">Improving children's health from birth to 19 is an ambitious agenda. In order to drive change in every area, we know that we need stronger joint leadership to plan, commission and monitor the delivery of excellent services. The strategy sets out how we will help those on the frontline make a reality of this vision.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/19">The strategy sets out a clear expectation that Children's Trust partners are to provide children and families with accessible and comprehensive information about the services, advice and support available locally. New commitments to support local provision include action to:</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/20" class="indent">promote stronger joint leadership and local accountability arrangements, with statutory Children's Trust Boards to include GP members as well as Primary Care Trusts;</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/21" class="indent">ensure all organisations with responsibility for child health and wellbeing are fulfilling their statutory responsibilities for safeguarding children;</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/22" class="indent">develop the child health workforce, with a particular early focus on health visitors;</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/23" class="indent">deliver a support programme for local authorities and PCTs to commission child health services;</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/24" class="indent">strengthen the information available to help plan, monitor and improve services; and</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/25" class="indent">give a stronger voice for children and young people in assessments of healthcare organisations, and robust arrangements to promote and ensure the quality of health services.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/26">With schools, GP practices, hospitals, Sure Start children's centres, the voluntary sector and Government all playing their part in support of families, we can ensure that every child has a healthy start in life and a brighter future. Working together, we can continue to work towards our goal to make this the best place in the world to grow up.</p>
	<p pid="e.71WS.1/27">Copies of &quot;Healthy lives brighter futures: The strategy for children and young people's health&quot; and the accompanying guidance on joint commissioning will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="e.81WS.1/1">Together with my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and the Minister for Housing, I am today publishing three consultation documents, the &quot;Heat and Energy Saving Strategy&quot; (HESS), the &quot;Carbon Emissions Reduction Target uplift&quot; (CERT) and the&quot; Community Energy Saving Programme&quot; (CESP), which together make up a comprehensive package to save energy and reduce emissions from now through to 2020 and beyond and increase the UK's energy security.</p>
	<p pid="e.81WS.1/2">The consultation on &quot;Heat and Energy Saving Strategy&quot; sets out the Government's long-term vision for dramatically improving the energy efficiency of our homes and businesses. If the UK is to achieve its targets on emissions reductions and renewable energy, we will have to move beyond conventional and easy to install energy efficiency measures and consider more radical ways of saving energy. We will also need to decarbonise the generation and supply of heat. By 2050, emissions from UK households need to be approaching zero if we are to meet our target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent.. The Minister for Housing recently published a consultation setting out proposals on making new homes zero-carbon from 2016, and seeking views on the Government's ambition that non-domestic buildings should be zero carbon from 2019. This strategy therefore concentrates on existing buildings. By 2020, our ambition is to have made available comprehensive whole house solutions to improve the energy performance of approximately 7 million homes. Building on this and by 2030, we aim to have made those measures available to all households.</p>
	<p pid="e.81WS.1/3">In support of this, two consultations on increasing the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target by 20 per cent. and the Community Energy Saving Programme set out the Government's immediate plans for households. In particular, they include increasing the current roll-out of energy efficiency measures and a new programme to deliver whole house solutions to the most vulnerable households in deprived communities. The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) is the Government's principal tool for delivering household energy and carbon savings. Under CERT, electricity and gas suppliers are required to meet challenging carbon-saving targets by encouraging households to take up energy efficiency measures. Suppliers are free to decide how to deliver their obligations, but typically will promote free and subsidised offers on key measures such as loft and cavity wall insulation and high-efficiency lights and appliances. They are obliged to meet at least 40 per cent. of their targets in a priority group qualifying, low-income households, including those aged over 70. The obligation applies in England, Scotland and Wales. By way of increasing the number of energy saving measures available to consumers and in response to high and rising energy prices, the Prime Minister, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September 2008</phrase>, proposed raising the CERT target by 20 per cent.. Making a significant contribution to the UK's environmental and social ambitions, increasing the level of CERT will mean a revised carbon target of 185 million tonnes lifetime C02 savings (from 154MtC02) to be delivered by <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. This means annual savings of 5:3 MtC02 (from 4.2 MtC02), equivalent to the annual C02 emissions from 940,000 homes. It is expected to drive increased energy supplier investment of some &pound;576 million, taking total energy supplier CERT investment to some &pound;3.2 billion.</p>
	<p pid="e.81WS.1/4">The Community Energy Savings Programme (CESP) was also announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September 2008</phrase> by the Prime Minister, and aims to deliver holistic packages of carbon abatement measures to vulnerable households in low-income, deprived communities in Great Britain and offers an opportunity to pilot some of the approaches outlined in the &quot;Heat and Energy Saving&quot; consultation document. The key proposals will deliver substantial emissions reductions and permanent fuel bills savings for those in the targeted areas, and are:</p>
	<p pid="e.81WS.1/5" class="indent">A new obligation on energy suppliers and electricity generators to deliver an estimated &pound;350 million of energy efficiency measures, and to ensure fairness to be targeted at the most vulnerable domestic consumers.</p>
	<p pid="e.81WS.1/6" class="indent">Ensuring targeted households, and hard to treat properties, receive the most effective and expensive actions like solid wall insulation.</p>
	<p pid="e.81WS.1/7" class="indent">Measures to be offered as a package to deliver whole house solutions, delivered in a house by house, street by street approach.</p>
	<p pid="e.81WS.1/8" class="indent">To deliver support through a community partnership where local authorities and community groups work with the electricity generators and energy suppliers to help identify the households in most need.</p>
	<p pid="e.81WS.1/9">The proposals in these consultation documents will help us to tackle both the immediate difficulties people face in paying their energy bills and the longer-term issues we face in becoming more energy efficient and decarbonising our heat supply.</p>

	<p pid="e.88WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-05">5 February</phrase> I made an oral statement to the House on the case of Mr. Binyam Mohamed, following the judgment handed down in the High Court on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-04">4 February</phrase>. As I underlined in the debate that followed, we are working as fast and as hard as we can to secure Mr. Mohamed's release from Guantanamo Bay and return to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.88WS.1/2">I now wish to update the House regarding progress made in Mr. Mohamed's case.</p>
	<p pid="e.88WS.1/3">Senior Government officials, including Her Majesty's Ambassador to the United States, have held further talks with the US Administration in recent days. President Obama issued Executive Orders on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-22">22 January</phrase> which established a review of the cases of all those detained at Guantanamo Bay. Following our representations, the US Administration has now agreed that Mr. Mohamed's case should be treated as a priority in this process. We continue to work with the US to achieve a swift resolution.</p>
	<p pid="e.88WS.1/4">We have long been concerned with reports of Mr. Mohamed's welfare and medical condition. Yesterday I met with Mr. Mohamed's US military defence counsel, Lt. Col. Yvonne Bradley, and her account underlined these concerns. The US government has also agreed that Foreign Office officials should visit Mr. Mohamed as soon as possible. The visit will help us make preparations for his return, should the review confirm a decision to release him. The team will include a medical examiner, who would take part in any return, so that he may assess Mr. Mohamed's condition himself and report back.</p>
	<p pid="e.88WS.1/5">I will keep the House informed on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="e.90WS.1/1">I am today laying regulations on fees for immigration and nationality services.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.1/2">The Government review the fees on a regular basis and makes appropriate changes as necessary. We have continued with our strategic approach to charging; setting certain fees on the basis of the value of the service as well as cost recovery in a number of areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.1/3">Some fees will continue to be set at or below levels that reflect the administrative costs of the service. These fees must be set out in regulations before both Houses of Parliament and are subject to the negative procedure. Other fees continue to be set at levels above the normal administrative costs of the service. This allows us to generate revenue which is used either to set certain fees below cost recovery or to deliver the Government's wider objectives such as the doubling of resource for enforcement announced in March 2007, and the fund to manage the transitional impacts of migration announced in July 2008. These fees must also be specified in regulations before both Houses, but are subject to the affirmative process.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.1/4">Today I laid regulations setting the fees charged above cost recovery. I am announcing our proposals for all the immigration and nationality fees we intend to charge during 2009/10 in order that Parliament may consider these regulations in context. For transparency, I have included the estimated unit cost for each route, so that it is clear which fees are set at or below cost recovery and the degree to which certain other routes are not.</p>
	<p pid="e.90WS.1/5">Finally, we have also proposed fees for several new processes and services we provided previously free of charge. These new services were specified in the Fees Order laid on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-21">21 January</phrase>. The fees for these services will be set in negative regulations. Full details on how to apply for these services will be provided on our website, <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="e.101WS.2/1">My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary of state (Lord Bach) has made the following Written ministerial statement.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/2">&quot;Between <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-18">18 June</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-10">10 September 2008</phrase>, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Legal Services commission (LSC) consulted on options for how payments made under the Family Graduated Fees Scheme, which governs payments to barristers for family legal aid work, could be reduced in order to live within budget, and to protect services to vulnerable clients. Our consultation was announced in a statement made by my noble Friend, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-18">18 June</phrase><i>, Official R</i><i>eport</i>, column WS81.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/3">Expenditure on legal aid barrister family advocacy has risen unsustainably from &pound;74 million to nearly &pound;100 million in the last five years&mdash;a rise of over 30 per cent. Over the same period, the number of cases has increased by only 11 per cent., so there has been a significant rise in average case costs in a short period. Payments to family barristers now form over 10 per cent. of the entire civil legal aid budget. Legal aid operates within a fixed budget and the department is obliged to take action to remain within that budget, or risk being forced to reduce vital services.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/4">Following the close of our formal consultation in the autumn, we have continued to engage with interested parties to hear their views. We are grateful to respondents for their time. We have listened and changed many of our proposals, and accepted some of the suggestions made by consultees.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/5">Today I am announcing a package of measures to restructure family barrister payments, reduce overall expenditure, and to refocus resources on high-priority clients. Given the significant priority afforded to public law children cases, these reductions will apply primarily to private family law work, such as child contact and residence disputes, and disputes over property. The Government is considering how we can increase the number of private law disputes which are resolved through mediation, because adversarial proceedings are not always in the interest of the parties. We will make the following changes to the Family Graduated Fee Scheme for barristers:</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/6">Abolish the &quot;more than two parties&quot;. Special Issue Payment which provides a 40 per cent. increase to fees when claimed in public law cases. We received strong representations from interested parties that this element of the scheme did not represent a sufficiently 'special' issue to merit a fee increase, as there are more than two parties in the large majority of such cases.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/7">Re-direct most of the funding spent on the 2 more than two parties&quot; Special Issue Payment into increasing by &pound;4.4 million p.a. the fees paid to barristers for hearings and conferences in child care or supervision proceedings. This will mean an increase in fees paid to lawyers in at least 3,500 of these cases each year.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/8">In private law disputes concerning child contact or residence, reduce the Special Issue Payments claimable by barristers for conduct issues and additional experts from 50 per cent. to 30 per cent. and 20 per cent. respectively. Both of these payments are currently running at 150 per cent. of the level intended.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/9">In private law disputes concerning financial settlement on divorce, abolish the most expensive Special Issue Payments claimable by barristers for issues concerning conduct, analysis of accounts, assets which are outside the control of the parties, and more than one expert. In addition, we intend to reduce the Special Issue Payments claimable for litigants in person or a relevant foreign element from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. All of these payments are running at a level higher than that intended.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/10">Introduce tighter procedures for barristers' claims for Special Preparation Fees, which was a suggestion made to us by interested parties. This is an area where fees are running at 800 per cent. of the level that anyone expected. Barristers will be required to submit to judges a detailed schedule of the hours spent in preparation so that these payments are only made where appropriate. We will also revise the claim forms so that the basis of any claim is clear.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/11">We are not reducing expenditure in the Domestic Violence category.</p>
	<p pid="e.101WS.2/12">Annual expenditure on family barristers' fees is now nearly &pound;26 million per year higher than it was five years ago&mdash;an increase which far outstrips any increase in cases. These changes will help us to reduce net expenditure by &pound;6.5 million per year, and to refocus resources on some of the most vulnerable families and children in society&quot;</p>

	<p pid="e.119WS.1/1">This statement explains two supplementary issues concerning payments of Invalidity Allowances to pensioners from April 2009.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/2">The Uprating Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-11">11 December 2008</phrase> announced new rates of Invalidity Allowance for customers under pensionable age to support the alignment of the rates of Incapacity Benefit and Employment and Support Allowance.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/3">The rates for eligible pensioners due to receive Invalidity Allowance will be increased in line with the retail price index in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/4">The Department subsequently wrote to pensioners eligible for an Invalidity Allowance informing them of their entitlements. However, due to a technical error, a small number were sent an entitlement notice which was incorrect.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/5">The Pensions Disability and Carers Service will ensure that the vast majority of customers who receive an Invalidity Allowance will receive accurate payments from April 2009&mdash;and we will notify those customers who receive an inaccurate notification that this correction has been made.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/6">This will ensure that for all of those pensioners their incomes are unaffected and the correct benefits paid.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/7">There will be a small number for whom corrections cannot be made before April and those will be corrected as soon as possible. If an under-payment has occurred, we will ensure the payment is corrected by June, and any arrears are paid to the pensioner. If an over-payment has occurred, we will not seek recovery though we will correct the overpayment as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/8">Of the 500,000 pensioners with entitlement to an Invalidity Allowance we estimate that around 45,000 people may be overpaid and around 25,000 may be underpaid, depending on their individual circumstances. We estimate that the amount of weekly overpayment will range from a minimum 5p to a maximum of &pound;3. The maximum underpayment will be &pound;1.80 a week.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/9">Any arrears will be calculated and paid to customers, and we will not take any action to seek recovery of these overpayments. As the Department works through the affected cases it will write to all customers who are affected to explain their position.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/10">As people become pensioners from April 2009, they should automatically move on to the higher rate of Invalidity Allowance. Because, the Uprating Order for this year does not provide the statutory basis ordinarily needed to make these higher payments, we shall be making them on an extra-statutory basis in the coming tax year. Around 7,000 customers are affected with payments worth in total around &pound;350,000.</p>
	<p pid="e.119WS.1/11">Our customers will not need to take any action. The Pension, Disability and Cares Service will identify and correct cases as soon as possible and contact all of those concerned.</p>
