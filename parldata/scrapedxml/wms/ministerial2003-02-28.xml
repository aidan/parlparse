	<p pid=".56WS.1/1">In the statement made by the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/926" name="Nigel Griffiths">my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-14">14 January 2003</phrase>, <i>Official Report,</i> col. 547&ndash;50, he said that the Greenpeace protestors who entered the Sizewell nuclear power station had not penetrated any of the internal security barriers.</p>
	<p pid=".56WS.1/2">My hon. Friend's statement was made on the basis of the best information available at the time from the nuclear operating company, British Energy. However, it is now known that although initial reports did not indicate that any sensitive area had been breached at the time of the Greenpeace incursion, a subsequent inspection by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security has established that some of the intruders entered through a door, which amounted to a breach of the Sizewell inner security barrier. Further defences within the inner security barrier contained the intruders and I should stress that at no time were any sensitive areas of the plant breached. The incursion was accurately assessed at the time not to pose a security threat and the response was measured and appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".56WS.1/3">The Director of Civil Nuclear Security has implemented a full investigation into the incursion, including this breach, with the full co-operation of the operating company. Immediate remedial action has been taken to prevent a recurrence of this breach of the inner security barrier and other lessons learned from the incident are being acted on appropriately.</p>

The remaining &pound;3,700,000 is in respect of the Criminal Records Bureau. The bulk of this claim, as last year, simply aligns the resource budget for IND more closely with the actual spend and reflects a long-planned in-year adjustment to the unrealistic budget level originally set in July 2000. (ii) Criminal Records Bureau: A reduction of &pound;11,485,000 in RfR01: subhead E1 and a corresponding increase of &pound;37,447,000 in RfR01: subhead E.5 consisting of a reduction in the forecast of receipts, as well as contributions totaling &pound;10,200,000 from Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills.

(iii) Transfers from Other Government Departments (OGDs) totaling &pound;15,706,000 including: Cabinet Office to RfFM: subhead C1 of &pound;250,000 to provide the appropriate provision for the transfer of the CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological &amp; Nuclear) Team.

Department of Health to RfRI: subhead G3 of &pound;62,000 for matched funded Intermediate Care Services Project. Department of Work and Pensions to RfR1: subhead AQ3 of &pound;450,000 for Street Crime Initiative Funding to link street crime offenders into employment opportunities.

	<p pid=".63WS.2/1">In my written reply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/781" name="Menzies Campbell">the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr Campbell)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-15">15 April 2002</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, col. 723W, I informed Parliament that we had questions about other possible breaches of the Israeli assurances about the use of UK-supplied equipment in the Occupied Territories (OTs) exported under previous Administrations. The Government has looked into the issue further and I am now able to inform Parliament of the outcome of our inquiries.</p>
	<p pid=".63WS.2/2">The only equipment that has been identified as being used by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) in the OTs, and that can justifiably be regarded as constituting a breach of the assurances, is a combination of Puma and Nachpadon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). These are derivative APCs on a Centurion chassis, which therefore have a significant and recognisable UK content. Parliament was informed of this in Mr Bradshaw's reply to a parliamentary question from Mr Galloway on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-11">11 March 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".63WS.2/3">In our view the Israeli assurances do not cover equipment consisting of components exported by the UK to a third country, which components were then incorporated in that country into products for onward export. The Foreign Secretary's announcement of <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-08">8 July 2002</phrase> set out how the Government will approach licence applications for goods where it is understood that the goods are to be incorporated into products for onward export.</p>
	<p pid=".63WS.2/4">We intend to inform the Israelis of the results of our inquiries. We shall re-emphasise our current concerns about exporting arms to Israel that might be used against Palestinian targets, and that our policy on assessing Israeli export applications has not changed: we shall continue to assess export licence applications for the proposed export of controlled goods to Israel on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".63WS.2/5">Our staff will continue to monitor the deployment and the use of equipment by the IDF in the OTs during their regular tours of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem; and will report to me any sightings of British-supplied equipment.</p>
