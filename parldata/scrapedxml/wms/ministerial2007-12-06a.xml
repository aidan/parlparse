	<p pid="a.80WS.4/1">My noble Friend the Minister of State for Trade and Investment (Lord Jones of Birmingham) has made the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.4/2" class="indent">Following my closing speech at Second Reading on the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-28">28 November 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-11-28.1280"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1280</phrase>, I would like to clarify to the House the Government's understanding of the British Retail Consortium's views on the inclusion of a cost recovery provision relating to the operation of the Primary Authority arrangements under part 2 of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.4/3" class="indent">I understand that the position of the British Retail Consortium is that there should be no such charges on businesses in a Primary Authority partnership. In informal discussion during the consultation on the draft Bill with a number of businesses, however, it was put to us that the inclusion of a power for local authorities to recover the costs of the service provided from the business would not be unwelcome, provided that the service provided ensured a reliable level of consistency in the regulatory approach taken to the business across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.80WS.7/1">I am today announcing a suspension of adoptions of Guatemalan children by UK residents in response to concerns about adoption practice in Guatemala. The suspension takes effect immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.7/2">We have had long-standing concerns about the adoption process in Guatemala, as evidenced by the imposition of additional procedural checks administered by the British embassy in Guatemala and the UK's objection to Guatemala's accession to the Hague convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.7/3">I am now introducing a suspension of adoptions in response to new evidence which demonstrates that: there are insufficient safeguards in the Guatemalan adoption system to prevent children being adopted without proper consents being given and improper financial gain being made by individuals in the adoption process. In particular that: there is a trade in babies being sold for overseas adoption; and mothers are being paid, or otherwise encouraged, to give up children for adoption. Such practices are, of course, contrary to the principles of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.7/4">I have given careful consideration to the position of UK prospective adopters currently in the process of adopting from Guatemala. I have decided that the suspension will take effect at the point when a Certificate of Eligibility is sent to Guatemala by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (or in a Northern Ireland case by the Department for Health, Social Services and Public Safety for Northern Ireland). This is the last point in the application process administered by the DCSF (or the DHSSPS).</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.7/5">Applications already sent to Guatemala will be not be prevented from proceeding in the usual way (subject, of course, to the usual checks), but only in exceptional circumstances will I consider that any other application may proceed. A decision about any application for an exception to the suspension will take account of the best interests of the child and all the facts of the particular case.</p>
	<p pid="a.80WS.7/6">I understand that the Guatemala authorities intend to legislate so as to implement the Hague Convention in the coming months, but I consider that the nature of the information currently held means we must act now. I will, of course, consider the effect on the ground of any changes to adoption legislation and practice in Guatemala, in keeping the suspension under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.84WS.2/1">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December</phrase> in Brussels. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. David Miliband) will represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/3">General Affairs</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/4" class="italic">Preparation of the European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-14">14 December</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/5">The Council will discuss preparation of the European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-14">14 December</phrase> in Brussels. The Government expect the European Council to focus on discussions of the mandate for a &quot;Reflection Group&quot; (&quot;Group of the Wise&quot;), and the adoption by the Council of a Declaration on Globalisation. The presidency will seek, with the Government's strong support, a signal from the European Council that, with the signing of the Lisbon treaty on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-13">13 December</phrase>, the EU now has a stable institutional framework for the foreseeable future and should focus on delivering concrete results for its citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/6">Discussion at the European Council is also expected to cover Justice and Home Affairs; a renewed commitment to the Lisbon Strategy for Jobs and Growth; energy and climate: change; and external relations where the Government's priorities will be Kosovo and Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/7" class="italic">2007 Enlargement Package</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/8">The Council is expected to take stock of progress on EU enlargement following the publication of the Commission's enlargement strategy and progress reports on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase>. The Government hope the Council will adopt conclusions reaffirming its commitment to enlargement on the basis of the conclusions of the European Council in December 2006, while welcoming the Commission's reports and recommendations for further progress. This will encourage continuation of reform efforts by all the candidates and potential candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/9">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/10" class="italic">European Neighbourhood Policy</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/11">The Commission is expected to brief the Council on its latest communication on the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which is likely to take stock of the progress made on ENP since last year's communication, and to make proposals for how to take the policy forward. The Government endorses ENP as a vital framework for supporting our EU neighbours in implementing their political and economic reforms, and as a means of tackling common challenges such as economic integration, energy and climate change, terrorism and extremism, migration, and good governance, to the benefit of all member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/12" class="italic">Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/13">The Council will discuss the regulation implementing Economic Partnership Agreements in signatory African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACPs) from <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>. The Commission will also present a paper recommending options compatible with the World Trade Organisation for those non-least developed countries who are unable to conclude negotiations by the end of the year. The Government wants duty-free quota-free access for all ACP exports to the EU market and will work to ensure that countries who have showed willingness to engage in the negotiations are not worse off in January 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/14" class="italic">Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/15">Discussion of the Western Balkans is expected to focus on Kosovo and will coincide with the end of the period of talks facilitated by the EU-US-Russia Troika. All indications are that Belgrade and Pristina will not have reached agreement on Kosovo's status. The Government will be pushing for the EU to take a leading role in charting the way ahead after the talks, acting decisively to ensure that Kosovo's status is rapidly resolved so that the whole region can move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/16">The Council is expected to adopt conclusions on enlargement and the Western Balkans. The Government support the EU perspective for the Western Balkans&mdash;it has driven key reforms and helped the region move forward from the conflicts of the 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/17" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/18">The Council is expected to discuss steps the EU can take to support the agreed twin-track international approach to the Iranian nuclear issue. The High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, is expected to brief the Council on his recent meeting with Saeed Jalili, Secretary of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/19" class="italic">Middle East</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/20">The Council is expected to welcome the progress made at the Annapolis Conference and to discuss the forthcoming Paris donors' conference. The Council is also expected to adopt conclusions focusing on the Annapolis Conference and EU action in support, including work to strengthen Palestinian security capacity through expansion of the EU mission to support the Palestinian civilian police, and the Paris donors' conference in December. The Government are committed to supporting the shared goal at Annapolis, &quot;to immediately launch good faith bilateral negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues without exception, as specified in previous agreements.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/21">The Council is also expected to discuss Lebanon, following the departure of President Lahoud on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November</phrase>. The Government remain concerned about the divisions between the Lebanese Government and the opposition over the election of a successor, which has been a major cause of tension in Lebanon. There now appear to be encouraging signs of progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/22">The Council is expected to adopt conclusions urging a swift, peaceful and democratic outcome to the process. The Government welcome the EU's sustained engagement on Lebanon and continues to support French efforts to facilitate a compromise between the Lebanese political parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/23" class="italic">Burma</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/24">Burma has been added to the agenda at the Government's request in order to maintain EU focus on Burma and to support the work of the UN Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari and the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Sergio Pinheiro. The Government also want the Council to take stock of the continuing detailed, follow-on work on EU sanctions being undertaken following decisions at the October and November Councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/25" class="italic">Sudan</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.2/26">The Government want the Council to send a strong statement on Sudan-Darfur and Chad through conclusions reiterating the EU's support for the ongoing UN-African Union (AU) led efforts to achieve a sustainable peace settlement in Darfur. The Government also expect the Council to call on all parties to do all they can to ensure prompt deployment of an effective AU-UN peacekeeping force, UNAMID, which will assume authority from the current AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS) by <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase>, and to call for the early deployment of the planned EU mission to Chad and the Central African Republic.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-06a.86WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="86WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071206/wmstext/71206m0002.htm#07120639002363">
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/1">I have today placed in the Library my proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales from 2008-09 to 2010-11. I intend to implement the proposals on police grant subject to consideration of any representations and to the approval of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/2">Policing and reducing crime remain top priorities for this Government. The 2006-07 British Crime Survey shows that since peaking in 1995, crime has fallen by 42 per cent. representing over 8 million fewer crimes. The Government have worked very hard to maintain the police grant at a good level for the next three years as well as to provide secure and stable funding across policing, crime and drugs. Police authorities will receive a realistic and affordable increase in grant, backed up by a programme of reform and modernisation and a continuing drive to increase efficiency and productivity and cut bureaucracy. chief constables and police authorities will have maximum flexibility to make the best possible use of resources to maintain the historically high number of police officers and have the right workforce balance they need to deliver local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/3">I have placed in the Library of the House today copies of the &quot;National Community Safety Plan for England 2008-11&quot;. The plan supports greater partnership working on community safety at national, regional and local level, and is intended to support practitioners in planning and delivering community safety objectives. The plan also includes our strategic policing priorities and key actions for the police service for 2008-09. The &quot;National Community Safety Plan&quot; follows on from, and supports, the objectives in the Government's crime strategy, published in July this year &quot;Cutting Crime: A New Partnership 2008-11&quot;. The crime strategy sets out how we will continue to build on the achievements of the past ten years, refreshing our approach to meet new challenges. The new &quot;Make Communities Safer&quot; PSA supports the crime strategy and helps to establish a more mature relationship between central Government and local delivery partners for driving improvement priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/4">The settlement builds on considerable investment in the police service over the past decade. On a like for like basis Government grant for the police will have increased by over 60 per cent. or over &pound;3.7 billion between 1997-98 and 2010-11. Our investment in policing, as well as significant extra investment from local taxpayers and the delivery by police forces and authorities of substantial increases in efficiency, has helped to expand local policing successfully, reduce crime and make our communities safer</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/5">The police service has responded well to the demands placed on it but we must make sure the service is in the best possible shape to meet them. We are committed to consolidating and building on the significant reforms and achievements to date, to support the police service in meeting these new challenges. In support of these aims, Sir Ronnie Flanagan is currently undertaking an independent review of policing. We also intend to publish a Green Paper in spring 2008 to consult on wider proposals for change.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/6">Excellent progress is being made in the delivery of neighbourhood policing. By April 2008 there will be a neighbourhood policing team in every area and we are ahead of schedule with more than 75 per cent. of England and Wales already covered by neighbourhood policing teams. Some 16,000 police community support officers are now supporting police officers in delivering real changes on the ground, fighting crime and making communities feel safer. Together with CLG, community safety partners and other agencies, the Home Office is working to integrate neighbourhood policing with local neighbourhood management to ensure that we have the greatest number of services working together to tackle the issues identified by our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/7">The Government remain committed to building on the significant progress that have been made to date in increasing efficiency and productivity and reducing unnecessary bureaucracy, to ensure that officers are most effectively focused on their front line duties. We want to empower and equip officers so they can provide the most visible and accessible police presence in the community possible. We intend to support this through a new efficiency and productivity strategy on which we are working with the service. In addition, this will be supported by further improvements to working practices and processes, greater flexibility and streamlining of local performance management requirements and wider access to innovative crime fighting technology that will be supported by a new &pound;50 million capital fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/8" class="italic">The Police Grant Settlement 2008<i>-</i><i>09 </i><i>&mdash;</i><i> 2010</i><i>-</i>11</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/9">Total provision for policing revenue grants in 2008-09 will be &pound;9,227 million, an overall increase of 2.9 per cent. Provision is also made for 2.9 per cent. in 2009-10 and 2.7 per cent. in 2010-11. I propose to distribute the settlement as set out below.</p>

	<p pid="a.86WS.2/25">Police funding proposals within the local government finance system are being announced by my hon. Friend, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth (John Healey)</phrase> today. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-05">5 November</phrase>, the Welsh Assembly Government announced its proposals for Revenue Support Grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/26">Provisional general policing grants (that is, Home Office Police Grant, Revenue Support Grant and National Non Domestic Rates) for English and Welsh police authorities in 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 are set out at tables 2 to 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/27" class="italic">General grant</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/28">Within the general grant provision of 2.7 per cent. I have set a funding floor at 2.5 per cent. in each of the CSR years. This means that each police authority in England and Wales is guaranteed an increase of at least this level in each year. This provides for stability while enabling us to move towards fuller implementation of the needs-based funding formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/29">The employer pension contribution rate payable by police authorities for police officers will be reduced from 24.6 per cent. of pensionable pay to 24.2 per cent. with effect for three years starting from April 2008. This revaluation does not affect employee contribution rates. We expect that the reduced employer contribution rate will result in a saving to police authorities of approximately &pound;15 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/30">The settlement recognises the importance of efficiency and productivity increases for police authorities. Compared to 2007-08, police authorities will be expected to deliver 9.3 per cent. cashable increases in efficiency and productivity by the end of 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/31">Keeping council tax under control remains a priority for the Government. And my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made clear in his statement on the comprehensive spending review that the Government expects the average council tax increase in England in 2008-09 to be substantially below 5 per cent. No decisions have been taken on capping principles in 2008-09 but we have made clear that we will not hesitate to use our capping powers as necessary to protect council tax payers from excessive increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/32" class="italic">Formula Grant Distribution</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/33">During the summer we consulted on whether to update the resource base of the formula and whether &quot;rule 2 grants&quot; (former specific grants now allocated with general grant) and the crime fighting fund (CFF) should continue as separate entities or be incorporated into general grant. I have carefully considered all the representations received in response to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/34">I have decided to update the resource base of the formula to reflect better the pressures facing the police. I have also decided, in the interest of stability, not to incorporate &quot;rule 2 grants&quot; into general grant. Likewise, the CFF will remain in its present, unhypothecated, form to give maximum flexibility to police authorities and chief constables.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/35">I have decided to move funding for the Initial Police Learning and Development Programme (IPLDP) from ring fenced status to a &quot;rule 2 grant&quot;. It will no longer be ring-fenced and will be distributed on the basis of each force's allocations in the last two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/36" class="italic">Welsh Police Authorities</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/37">In line with previous years I have ensured that Welsh police authorities are treated in line with English police authorities. I have provided additional support of &pound;15.4 million in 2008-09, &pound;15.5 million in 2009-10 and &pound;15.7 million in 2010-11 to ensure that Dyfed-Powys, Gwent and North Wales police authorities receive at least a minimum grant increase of 2.5 per cent. This additional support is also partly funded by reducing police grant to South Wales police authority, so that it too will receive the level of grant it would if it were in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/38" class="italic">Metropolitan Police funding</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/39">The settlement provides for the Metropolitan police authority to receive &pound;197 million in 2008-09 (+&pound;5 million over 2007-08) in formula provision to reflect their unique national and international role as well as the functions that fall to them by virtue of London being a capital city. This has been uprated in line with inflation for each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/40" class="italic">Specific Grants for Police Authorities</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/41">Police authorities will continue to receive extra funding through a number of specific grants for particular schemes. Details are set out in table 5.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/42"><i>Crime Fighting Fund</i>: &pound;277 million will again be made available to forces in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/43"><i>Neighbourhood Policing</i>: To ensure that neighbourhood policing is fully embedded across England and Wales, I have accepted the recommendation made by Sir Ronnie Flanagan to maintain the ring-fence on this funding in 2008-09. A total of &pound;324 million will be made available in 2008-09. Funding will increase by an average of 2.7 per cent. in each of the CSR years.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/44"><i>Basic Command Units</i>: The basic command unit fund was introduced in 2003-04 for a two-year period, subsequently extended. I will be continuing this funding at the level of &pound;40 million in 2008-09. I will be providing &pound;50 million a year in 2009-10 and 2010-11. During 2008, we will be consulting with the police and other key delivery partners on how this &pound;50 million fund for years after 2008-09 can best be used, and by which partners, to support successful delivery of the new PSA targets and crime strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/45" class="italic">Counter<i>-</i>Terrorism</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/46">Funding for police counter terrorism will be increased from &pound;472 million in 2007-08 to &pound;524 million in 2008-09, &pound;552 million in 2009-10 and &pound;579 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/47" class="italic">Capital</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/48">In 2007-08 we were able to make two in-year capital payments of &pound;25 million each to police authorities. That additional funding has been continued for the CSR years and &pound;220 million in capital and supported capital expenditure will be allocated to police authorities in each of the next three years, with each authority receiving the same allocation as in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/49" class="italic">Other issues</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.2/50">I will shortly be making further announcements about funding for the Olympics and Protective Services.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-06a.94WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="94WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071206/wmstext/71206m0005.htm#07120639002364">
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-16">16 November 2006</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Security, Counter-terrorism, Crime and Policing (Tony McNulty) announced a review of police pay arrangements led by Sir Clive Booth. The first part of Sir Clive Booth's review looked at the arrangements for determining police officer pay in 2007. The second part considered the effectiveness of the current police pay machinery.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase> this year my right hon. Friend published Sir Clive Booth's report on part one of his review. His report &quot;Fair Pay for Police Officers&quot; contained recommendations for determining police officer pay for 2007, including that the police officer pay award for 2007 should be based on a new public sector-facing index. My right hon. Friend made clear in publishing Sir Clive Booth's report that the method for determining police officer pay for 2007 would then be progressed through the Police Negotiating Board, before the Home Secretary took the final decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/3">The Police Negotiating Board have considered the recommendations in Sir Clive Booth's report and the police officer pay award for 2007. Unfortunately the board was not able to reach agreement and the matter was therefore considered by the Police Arbitration Tribunal (PAT). I received the Police Arbitration Tribunal's recommendation for the police officer 2007 pay award on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-29">29 November 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/4">The PAT recommendation was:</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/5" class="indent">To increase the pay of all ranks of police officers covered by the three Standing Committees of the PNB by 2.5 per cent. with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/6">I have considered this recommendation very carefully. In doing so I have taken account of the tribunal's findings and reasoning, the need to ensure value for money and the best use of resources, affordability and Government policy on public sector pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/7">The tribunal's recommendation for a 2.5 per cent. increase is based on a new index expanding that proposed by Sir Clive Booth. Having fully considered the PAT findings I accept the recommendation of the tribunal for an award of 2.5 per cent. However I have given very serious consideration to the implementation of this award and concluded that in the interests of affordability, and Government policy on public sector pay, the implementation of this award should be staged. This year's police officer pay award will therefore be 2.5 per cent. with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-01">1 December 2007</phrase>. Staging will mean that around &pound;40m extra will be available in 2007-08 to invest in the provision of policing services to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/8">The index suggested by the PAT for the 2007 award could inform discussion and negotiation of the police officer pay award for next year. However, I will continue to give careful consideration to any proposals from the police pay machinery on next year's pay award. This consideration will include how any such award can make the best use of resources, affordability, the need to ensure consistency with Government policy on public sector pay and that the needs of the service and of the taxpayer and public are best served.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/9">Sir Clive Booth has now provided his report on part two of his review &quot;Determining Pay in the Police Service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/10">I am grateful to Sir Clive Booth for undertaking the review. He has undertaken a wide-ranging consultation with interested parties including the Police Federation, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities, the Superintendents' Association, the Chief Police Officers' Staff Association, Unison and others. In his report on part two of his review, Sir Clive Booth recommends that: (i) a pay review body for police officers should be created; (ii) the pay of police officers and police staff should continue to be determined by separate mechanisms; (iii) the existing Police Staff Council machinery should be retained for the time being; and (iv) that chief officers are covered by the proposed pay review body for police officers, but if that is not created chief officers should become one of the groups covered by the Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/11">The Government welcomes Sir Clive Booth's report and accepts that a pay review body for police officers, including chief officers, should be created, the pay of police officers and police staff should continue to be determined separately and that the Police Staff Council should be retained. We note that in due course unified officer and staff pay machinery may be considered, in particular as police workforce developments are progressed, but do not think that this is a practical proposition for the time being.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/12">The Government will consult, in the near future, on proposals for implementing the necessary changes to the police pay machinery.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.1/13">I have today placed a copy of Sir Clive Booth's report in the Library of the House.</p>
