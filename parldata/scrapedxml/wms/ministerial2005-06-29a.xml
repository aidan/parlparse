	<p pid="a.57WS.5/1">I am pleased to advise that we have today have today published a policy statement for England's native and ancient woodland. This has been prepared jointly by DEFRA and the Forestry Commission England.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.5/2">This policy represents a significant change in emphasis for forestry activities in England by placing native and ancient woodland at the heart of forestry policy. The policy sets out a vision where &quot;ancient woodland, veteran trees and other native woodland is adequately protected, sustainably managed in a wider landscape context, and is providing a wide range of social, environmental and economic benefits to society&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.5/3">Taken together, native and ancient woodland makes up around half of England's total woodland area. They contain numerous protected and priority species, provide excellent educational and recreational opportunities and are a source of quality renewable resources in the form of hardwood timber and other products.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.5/4">The policy will make a significant contribution to several Government targets and policies, in particular the Government's biodiversity strategy for England, and will also help fulfil international commitments and statutory obligations. The Forestry Commission will work in close alignment with natural England partners to ensure effective and coherent delivery of the policy, including a simplified system of support for landowners.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.5/5">Copies of the policy statement will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.58WS.2/1">The official launch of the United Kingdom Security Advisory Team (UKSAT) took place in Antigua on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-09">9 June 2005</phrase>, with addresses from the hon. Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, and John White, British High Commissioner for the Eastern Caribbean. Sir James Carlisle, Governor General of Antigua and Barbuda, and other senior representatives from the region were also present.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/2">The UKSAT project supports delivery of FCO's strategic priority 2: protection of the UK from illegal immigration, drug trafficking and other international crime, and strategic priority 8: security and good governance of the UK's Overseas Territories. The FCO is providing &pound;1.5 million of funding for the project in 2005&ndash;06. The Eastern Caribbean is a key transit point for cocaine from Latin America destined for the UK; through UKSAT, we are seeking further to develop our law enforcement cooperation and effectiveness in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/3">UKSAT will work in partnership with the Regional Security System (RSS) and the UK Caribbean Overseas Territories (COTs) to enhance law enforcement capacity in the RSS countries and the COTs. This will be achieved through training, advice and mentoring to strengthen actions against drug trafficking and other organised criminal groups operating in the Caribbean.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/4">The team will evolve over the next three years to consist of 14 personnel based in RSS countries: eight UK staff will include officers from HM Revenue and Customs and Royal Navy and six recruited regionally. UKSAT will work closely with the RSS security screening programme to tackle corrupt practices and integrity issues in regional law enforcement organisations. In addition, UKSAT programmes will be delivered elsewhere in the region, notably Jamaica and Trinidad.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/5">As part of UKSAT, the Maritime Training Unit in Antigua will, in conjunction with the RSS Training Unit, continue to provide training and advice in support of maritime law enforcement activities in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/6">This practical training commitment reflects the close cooperation which exists at all levels between Her Majesty's Government and Governments of the Caribbean nations and a shared commitment to tackle the problems of security and organised crime in the region, which affects both the Caribbean nations themselves and the UK. It is also of particular benefit to the COTs in helping them to meet their maritime law enforcement needs and in providing them with a sound basis to generate sustainable and effective operational capabilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.59WS.4/1">I am announcing today statistics relating to anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs).</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/2">An ASBO is a civil order which protects the community from behaviour that has caused or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as the perpetrator.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/3">ASBOs were introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and have been available since April 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/4">ASBOs can be issued to anyone aged 10 years or over. They impose restrictions on the behaviour of individuals who have behaved in an anti-social way and protect communities from often longstanding and highly intimidating activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/5">Breach of an ASBO is a criminal offence and can lead to custody. The maximum penalty for breach of an ASBO is five years imprisonment or a fine of up to &pound;5,000 for an adult offender.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/6">The Home Office is notified by all courts of ASBOs issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/7">Data on the number of ASBOs issued is updated quarterly. New figures for the period up to December 2004 are now available. These figures show that for the period between April 1999 and December 2004 the number of ASBOs issued (as reported to the Home Office) was 4,649. The number of ASBOs issued in the quarter October to December 2004 is 17 per cent. of the total number of ASBOs issued over all quarters and indicates that ASBO numbers for the latest quarter are double those of the same quarter last year (October to December 2003&mdash;364 ASBOs).</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/8">Of those ASBOs issued, 52 per cent. were to adults and 44 per cent. to juveniles (4 per cent. of ASBOs are age unknown).</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/9">Some 55 per cent. were orders on application, 45 per cent. were orders on conviction.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/10">I intend to make a similar statement to the House every quarter to provide an update on ASBOs statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/11">I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses a briefing note containing information about ASBOs and the ASBOs statistics issued today.</p>

	<p pid="a.60WS.5/1">I have today given consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Scottish and Southern Energy's application to construct and operate flue gas desulphurisation plant at its Fiddler's Ferry coal-fired power station near Warrington. Planning permission has also been given subject to the inclusion of 52 conditions agreed with Warrington borough council.</p>
	<p pid="a.60WS.5/2">Coal and other fossil fuels remain vital ingredients in our energy mix, but we need to reduce the impact that burning them has on the environment. Fitting flue gas desulphurisation plant at Fiddler's Ferry is a welcome step forward and will help reduce the damaging effects of acid rain.</p>

	<p pid="a.60WS.7/1">With my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, I am pleased to inform the House that UK Trade and Investment announced today, at its launch of the UK Inward Investment 2004&ndash;05 report, that there were 1,066 direct investments in the UK by foreign owned companies between <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. This is an increase of 31 per cent. on the year. Among business sectors, the largest number of projects were in IT, followed by software, pharma and biotech. Total jobs figures were up 26 per cent. to 75,043 of which 39,592 were new jobs (up 55 per cent. on the previous year) and 35,451 safeguarded jobs (up 5 per cent. on 2002&ndash;03)</p>
	<p pid="a.60WS.7/2">This performance reflects the confidence which companies around the world continue to show in the business climate in the UK. The number of new projects has increased by 49 per cent. from 339 in 2003&ndash;04 to 506 in 2004&ndash;05, while mergers/acquisitions and joint ventures were up 41 per cent from 187 in 2003&ndash;04 to 264 in 2004&ndash;05. Expansions by existing investors were up 3 per cent., from 285 in 2003&ndash;04 to 296 in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.60WS.7/3">The competition is fierce. But we will not allow our position as market leader in Europe to make us complacent. UKTI will further strengthen and sharpen its operations in priority markets and the Government will continue to ensure that the UK provides economic growth and stability and an innovative climate to attract investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.60WS.7/4">I am arranging for a copy of the UK Inward Investment 2004&ndash;05 report to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.61WS.2/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Rossendale borough council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/2">In 2003&ndash;04, Rossendale borough council administered some &pound;10 million in housing benefits, about 55 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. The council was not at standard in any of the seven functional areas of performance standards. However, since August 2003 it had made and sustained improvements in a number of areas. It had processed claims faster, improved the standard of verification of claims, prosecuted fraudsters and publicised its counter-fraud efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/3">However, there were significant weaknesses in strategic management, project management and planning arrangements, management of counter-fraud operations, and the recovery of overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/4">Inspectors found errors in recording the time taken to process new claims that caused performance to be understated. Claims were in fact being processed in 46 days on average between April and December 2004 compared with the council's previously reported performance of 55 days. Performance had improved to the extent that for the month of December 2004 claims were processed within an average of 36 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/5">Internal auditors and the Audit Commission had previously identified some of the weaknesses described in the BFI report. However, the council had not implemented their recommendations and audit findings were not reported to members and senior officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/6">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.62WS.1/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on South Cambridgeshire district council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/2">In 2002&ndash;03, South Cambridgeshire district council administered some &pound;15.5 million in housing benefits, about 21 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. BFI assessed the council against the performance standards for counter-fraud and the internal and external audit elements of strategic management and found that the council was not at standard. Strategically there were some areas of good practice, including a clear corporate vision, but this was not fully reflected in operational plans, policies or local targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/3">The council gave a high priority to combating benefit fraud. The fraud team was well trained and experienced and had been successful in securing several high profile prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/4">However, the report notes serious concerns over some of the council's working practices, including weaknesses in management checking and failure to use management information. Authorised officers' powers were used routinely to obtain information from third parties, but no monitoring of these activities was undertaken to ensure compliance with legislation, and several breaches of these powers were identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/5">There were also breaches of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in several of the interviews under caution that BFI examined. Other evidence indicated that the council was not fully complying with the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/6">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.62WS.3/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Hart district council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.3/2">In 2003&ndash;04 Hart district council administered some &pound;7.8 million in housing benefits, about 34 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. The BFI's follow-up inspection found that the council was not at standard in any of the seven functional areas of performance standards and was providing a poor level of service overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.3/3">The council had failed to fully implement over 80 per cent. of the recommendations made following the first BFI inspection in 2000. This failure led to weak performance in key areas including customer services and overpayments in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.3/4">The council's service to its customers was poor, due mainly to a limited telephone service, an out of date housing benefits claim form and confusing and inaccurate decision letters. While the council was reporting that it was processing new claims for housing benefits in 23 days, against the standard of 36 days, some claims were being decided with insufficient evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.3/5">A lack of management checks and insufficient overpayments training meant that the council unnecessarily created overpayments. It also incorrectly claimed subsidy for overpayments caused by local authority error and only recovered 14 per cent. of overpayments in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.3/6">This inspection found a number of improvements in the council's counter-fraud work, including correctly applying sanctions in line with the council's policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.3/7">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings</p>

	<p pid="a.63WS.1/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on mid-Suffolk district council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.1/2">In 2003&ndash;04, mid-Suffolk district council administered some &pound;6.6 million in housing benefits, about 29 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. In the final quarter of 2003&ndash;04 the council was taking 96 days on average to process new claims for housing benefits against the standard of 36 days. This placed it in the bottom 15 per cent. of local authorities for reported performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.1/3">BFI found that during 2003&ndash;04 the council had introduced a new benefits IT system, recruited benefits managers and addressed other resourcing issues in the benefits service. Reported claims processing performance dipped in the period following the introduction of the new benefits IT system. However, a recovery plan was agreed and the backlog of work was managed impressively and cleared between April and October 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.1/4">This was reflected in a dramatic improvement in the speed of processing new claims, to 29 days by October 2004. Verification of claims was also being undertaken to a high standard. The council acknowledged that the improved performance was achieved at the expense of management assurance and indicated that it intended to implement improvements in assurance as a priority. Mid-Suffolk district council also needs to develop procedural guidance and structure its approach to training staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.1/5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.64WS.1/3">Gosport borough council had made significant improvements in the time taken to process new claims and was now taking an average of 25 days although to some extent this improvement had been achieved at the expense of quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/4">Weaknesses in management checking and poor reporting of performance failed to provide Members or senior officers with adequate assurance about true levels of performance. This was compounded by a failure to monitor the implementation of audit recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/5">Poor publicity and failure to assess the needs of working customers and ethnic minority groups limited access to the service. The requirements of race relations legislation had not been fully met. Failure to record all customer complaints was a particular concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/6">The council's classification of overpayments was incorrect in some instances and this calls into question the accuracy and validity of the 2004&ndash;05 subsidy claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/7">An effective counter-fraud team used an intelligence-led system that maximised the time, training and expertise of its investigators and led to an increase in the volume of sanctions administered. However, BFI were concerned by the limited adherence to guidance in the council's own prosecution policy when a sanction was administered.</p>
