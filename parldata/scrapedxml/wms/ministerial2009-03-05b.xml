	<p pid="b.62WS.2/1">Today I have published the Government's formal response to the Killian Pretty review. Our response sets out our proposals to take forward an ambitious programme of measures to create a more proportionate and responsive planning application process. This will help businesses, developers, councils and the wider community, particularly in the current challenging economic environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/2">The review was commissioned jointly by the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government and Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to consider how the planning application process could be improved for the benefit of all involved. The final report, with detailed recommendations, was published in November 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/3">We welcome the Killian Pretty report as a strong foundation for the next stage in reforming the planning system. In response to its recommendations, we propose actions to improve the planning application process from start to finish, grouped into five main themes:</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/4" class="indent">reducing the number of small scale developments that require full planning permission;</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/5" class="indent">making the planning application process more efficient and effective for all involved;</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/6" class="indent">improving the quality of information available to users of the planning application system;</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/7" class="indent">improving local authority capacity and performance in the process; and</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/8" class="indent">streamlining the national planning policy framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/9">We propose a phased approach to reform, with immediate priority given to consulting on detailed proposals to extend permitted development rights for businesses and public services and to streamline information requirements for applicants.</p>
	<p pid="b.62WS.2/10">Clearly, successful development and implementation of further improvements to the planning application process requires the active involvement of key stakeholders, including local government, the profession and private sector. So a key part of the implementation programme is to work closely with stakeholders, in a range of ways, including the formation of a stakeholder sounding board, in addition to full public consultation on draft proposals, where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.65WS.2/1">The Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council was held in Brussels on 26 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-27">27 February 2009</phrase>. My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Justice, Lord Bach, and the Scottish Solicitor-General, Frank Mulholland QC, attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The following issues were discussed at the Council:</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/2">During the Mixed Committee with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, Ministers discussed progress in implementing the second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) in the light of the analysis which had identified problems in the central system. Both the Commission and the presidency recognised the importance of the SIS II programme and the presidency reiterated that the repair phase would consist of two aspects, to be developed in parallel: an analysis and repair plan to resolve known bugs in the current SIS II programme and a contingency plan. The presidency also stressed the need for agreement on a set of common criteria against which both of these aspects could be assessed in the first half of 2009. The Council subsequently adopted Council conclusions confirming the action required in relation to the central SIS II project and a set of criteria against which the SIS II based scenario and an alternative scenario, based on a SIS I platform, would be assessed. They confirmed that a decision regarding the future of the project would be taken by June 2009 at the latest.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/3">During the Interior Ministers' meeting the Commission outlined the plans for implementation of the Visa Information System (VIS), notifying member states that the final phase had been pushed back to December 2009. The UK does not participate in the VIS.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/4">The Council was presented with the draft report on the outcome of the Swiss air borders evaluation which will be considered by experts in March. Switzerland thanked the Commission and presidency for the help they had given in the months before the evaluation and indicated that it was happy with the conclusions of the draft report, taking note of its recommendations and undertaking to report regularly on progress. The presidency concluded by looking forward to <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-29">29 March</phrase> when the Swiss were expected to join the Schengen area in full.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/5">The Commission presented its proposal for a European Asylum Support Office (EASO) to the Council. The Commission explained that the EASO's aims would be to enhance practical cooperation; help member states under particular pressures; and ensure a common European asylum regime. It would not make case decisions and would be part-financed through changes to the European Refugee Fund. The Commission hoped that the proposal would receive political agreement by the summer and be implemented in 2010. The proposal was broadly welcomed by a number of member states. The UK thanked the Commission for its proposal, noting that it went to the heart of what European co-operation was about: making a difference on the ground. It emphasised its support for practical co-operation on asylum in order to provide protection for those who needed it. The UK stated that systems should be streamlined, to deliver fair decisions quickly and tackle abuse. The UK also argued for more work with countries outside the EU in order to stop asylum being the weak point in immigration systems and to stop refugees having to travel to the EU to find safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/6">The presidency presented the Commission's report on implementation of the free movement directive. The Commission said it hoped to adopt guidelines on application of the directive by the summer. They confirmed that the guidelines would cover abuses of free movement rights, including marriages of convenience and persistent criminality: moving to another member state carried responsibilities as well as rights. A number of member states highlighted their concerns about abuses of free movement. The UK welcomed the Commission's work on guidelines and asked that they should set out consequences when these responsibilities are not met.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/7">The Council briefly discussed the issue of combating illegal immigration in the Mediterranean. The discussion highlighted the role of Frontex (the European Border Agency), readmission agreements and the need for further development of the EU's Global Approach to Migration.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/8">The Council also discussed progress in resettling Iraqi refugees following the Council conclusions adopted in November 2008 which set an EU target of 10,000. The Commission welcomed the fact that member states had notified their intention to resettle 5,100 refugees so far, improving the situation of refugees in Syria and Jordan. The Commission stated that additional funds (&euro;20 million) would be made available to support member states' efforts.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/9">During the working lunch Interior Ministers discussed the appointment of the Europol director, but no agreement was reached. The presidency said that it wanted to reach agreement at the next JHA Council meeting in April. The UK said that the recommendation of the management board, endorsing the UK candidate, should be followed.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/10">The closure of the US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay was also discussed during lunch. Ministers agreed that there was a need to obtain more information and study all aspects of the issue. Following the previous discussion in the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) there was agreement that further discussion with the United States would be a good idea.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/11">Under any other business, SWIFT was discussed, concerning the controls and necessary safeguards on data protection and use under the Terrorist Financing Tracking programme. Judge Jean-Louis Brugui&egrave;re commented that the US Administration had set up a particularly robust programme to ensure the protection of personal data for counter terrorism purposes, though there was still room for improvement. The Commission would be making available a report on state of play on SWIFT. On the EU's anti-drug policy, the presidency and Commission stressed the need for more and better supply side indicators. A report would need to go to Council in June on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/12">Ministers reached a broad consensus on presidency conclusions to steer negotiations on the proposed framework decision on prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings, in particular focusing the instrument on preventing situations where the same person is subject to parallel proceedings in different member states, and establishing flexible mechanisms for communication. The UK supported these conclusions. The presidency hopes to be able to reach political agreement on this proposal at the June JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/13">A negotiating mandate was also agreed authorising the presidency to open discussions with Japan for an EU agreement on mutual legal assistance. The Commission noted that in future it would be necessary to decide how to prioritise target countries for these agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/14">The presidency updated member states on progress in e-justice and asked the Commission about the financing of e-justice projects, particularly video conferencing. The Commission reminded member states that there was already money available to fund e-justice projects and undertook to present all the available funding opportunities at the next JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/15">Under any other business the presidency provided a state of play report on negotiations on an amending directive on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements. It noted that the Transport and Tourism Committee of the European Parliament had proposed 19 amendments to the proposal. The presidency hoped that it would be possible to reach a first reading deal in April.</p>
	<p pid="b.65WS.2/16">Sweden presented a paper on transparency in the EU, advocating the need to demonstrate a greater commitment to transparency, stronger protection of citizens' individual rights and better understanding of the citizens' expectations. Germany updated member states on the appointment of a new director to the tribunal for the International Law of the Sea, which dealt with civil disputes.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-03-05b.69WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" speakername="Jonathan R Shaw" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions" colnum="69WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090305/wmstext/90305m0003.htm#09030551000253">
	<p pid="b.69WS.2/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-09">9 March 2009</phrase> in Brussels. I will represent the UK, except for the agenda item on the Pregnant Workers Directive where the UK will be represented by my hon. Friend, Minister of State for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs. There are no health or consumer affairs issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.69WS.2/2">The first and main item of the agenda is the preparation for the spring European Council which will be held on the 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-20">20 March 2009</phrase>. A key messages paper will be adopted following a public debate on the economic crisis and the European economic recovery plan. The key messages paper identifies the main messages emerging from the various other reports for adoption at the March Council. The presidency will also give information on preparation for the Tripartite Social Summit. The Tripartite Social Summit meets a minimum of once a year, including before each spring European Council. It is attended by the current presidency, the two future presidencies (Sweden and Spain), the Commission and the social partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.69WS.2/3">The next item will be the presidency's progress report on the negotiations to amend the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). Member states can apply to the EGF for matched funding of measures to help back into work any people made unemployed through large scale redundancies. The Government believe that the EGF plays an important role and the UK is involved in negotiations to ensure that recently proposed revisions mean that it plays that role as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.69WS.2/4">The Council will also seek adoption of Council conclusions based on the recent Commission Communication &quot;New Skills for New Jobs&quot;. The conclusions commit member states and the Commission to develop policies and services to address skills needs and labour markets mismatches. There will also be adoption of Council conclusions on Professional and Geographical Mobility and the Free Movement of Workers. The conclusions rightly stress the importance of joined-up approaches, to support professional and geographic mobility, in response to the economic downturn. The Government welcome both sets of conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="b.69WS.2/5">There will be a policy debate on the draft proposal to amend an existing directive which sets out the minimum protections for pregnant workers, and new or breastfeeding mothers. The UK system of maternity leave and pay is in many ways more generous than the proposed minimum. The Government support the aims of the proposal but need to ensure that any proposed changes would be compatible with our own existing provisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.69WS.2/6">Under any other business, the Commission will present its recent communication contributing to the spring European Council. In addition, the chairs of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee will give an oral presentation to provide information on their 2009 Work Programmes. There will also be information on all conferences held under Czech presidency to date.</p>
