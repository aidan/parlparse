	<p pid="a.61WS.3/16">The net change in the resource element of the DEL arises from the Machinery of Government change transferring the Government Social Research Unit from Cabinet Office to HM Treasury, &pound;914,000 for 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/17">The following items are DEL neutral:</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/18" class="indent">the draw down of &pound;600,000 administration costs from the Financial Inclusion Fund for expenditure on the promotion of banking services to those on low incomes. &pound;1 million of funding for the FIF was classified as Treasury non-voted DEL administration budget at the start of the year; the other &pound;400,000 remains within non-voted DEL.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/19" class="indent">Transfer between RfRs 1 and 3, &pound;12,465,000, to fund OGC's work on its wider remit, including delivering the efficiency programme and changes in provisions relating to the residual vacant estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/20" class="indent">Transfer between RfRs 1 and 2, &pound;3,700,000, for increased spend on coinage arising from higher metal prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/21" class="indent">Increase in appropriations-in-aid within all three RfRs (RfR1 &pound;10,702,000, RfR2 &pound;500,000, RfR3 &pound;325,000) with increased expenditure switching from RfR1 to RfR 2 for coinage spend, see above, and RfR 3 for expenditure relating to OGC's fee earning services.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/22" class="indent">Movement of OGC Efficiency Challenge Fund allocation from non-voted to voted, &pound;2,422,000. The allocation for the ECF within non-voted DEL for 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;7,800,000, and total forecast ECF expenditure for 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;8,868,000. The other &pound;6,446,000 of funding is being transferred from RfR 1, as above.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/23">The net reduction of &pound;1,745,000 in the capital element of the DEL arises from:</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/24" class="indent">Transfer of capital spend from Core Treasury (RfR 1) to fund planned expenditure by OGC (RfR 3). The transfer is DEL neutral. In addition, non-operating appropriations in aid are increased by &pound;1,380,000 to cover loan repayments from OGCbuying.solutions to OGC. The increased net provision is to finance OGC's spend on its domestic IT systems and capital improvements to its Norwich office.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/25" class="indent">A further reduction in core Treasury and DMO capital for provision in the Main Estimate no longer required.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.3/26">The non-voted resource DEL of &pound;35.4 million in the table above includes banking and gilts registration services provided by the Bank of England and Computershare, plus MEPs' salaries and the Civil List. Latest forecasts indicate that those activities are likely to underspend the provision by around &pound;3.9 million in aggregate. In addition, &pound;400,000 of the original &pound;1 million provision for the Financial Inclusion Fund and &pound;5,378,000 of the original &pound;7.8 million provision for the Efficiency Challenge Fund have not been transferred to voted resource DEL and will not be applied in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid="a.62WS.0/15">The increase in the DEL relates to resources only and arises from end year flexibility being drawn down. This is in order to allow National Savings and Investments to continue with the successful project investment, and to allow costs arising from more recent forecasts on the Evidence of Identity costs to be financed. More recent National Savings and Investments budgeting assumptions for 2005&ndash;06 showed an increase in costs associated with payments to Siemens Business Service (SBS) and other suppliers later in the year. These payments are necessary in order to meet National Savings and Investments financing targets.</p>
