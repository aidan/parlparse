	<p pid="b.89WS.2/1">I am today placing in the Libraries of both Houses copies of the strategy document &quot;Independence and Opportunity: Our Strategy for Supporting People&quot; and an associated impact assessment and equalities impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.2/2">The strategy document is the culmination of an extensive consultation with local authorities, service providers, service users and representative bodies on the future effective delivery of housing-related support.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.2/3">The document focuses on four key delivery issues:</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.2/4" class="indent">Keeping the needs of service users at the heart of the supporting people programme, by ensuring their involvement in the planning, design and delivery of services; and by encouraging choice and control over services, and by rationalising needs assessment for individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.2/5" class="indent">Enhancing our relationship with the third sector, who deliver the majority of housing related support services, by ensuring they have the capacity and tools to compete fairly for contracts to deliver services.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.2/6" class="indent">Delivering housing-related support services effectively in the new local government performance landscape, that is through the local area agreement framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.2/7" class="indent">Maximising efficiency and minimising bureaucracy through a national value improvement programme, which will assist in rationalising processes such as procurement and contracting.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.2/8">The strategy aims to provide additional clarity and focus to an already successful programme that helps a million people per year to attain or maintain independent living in their own homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.89WS.5/1">I and my hon. Friend, the Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare represented the United Kingdom at this month's Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg. Richard Lochhead, the Scottish Environment and Rural Affairs Minister, also attended.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/2">The Council reached unanimous political agreement on a presidency compromise proposal to reform the fruit and vegetable regime. The UK voted in favour as the reform met our negotiating objectives, including the flexibility we had sought with regards to allowing the four regions of the UK to take their own implementation decisions on inclusion of fruit and vegetables in the single payment scheme. The reform will also deliver full decoupling of the aids for products grown for processing.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/3">The Council also reached unanimous political agreement on a presidency compromise text, on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Greenland. The agreement provides fishing opportunities in Greenlandic waters for EU vessels including those of the UK, in return for Community funded financial contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/4">The Council adopted a conclusion on the Commission's report on the application of system of cross-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/5">The Council also adopted a set of general conclusions on the Commission's communication on reducing bycatches and eliminating discards. The UK intervened to welcome the Commission's initiative, but also drew attention to the potential difficulties in finding solutions that worked in the mixed fisheries which characterised the EU situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/6">The Council formally adopted a proposal to simplify and update the current regulation on organic food and farming, following the general agreement reached on the proposal during the Finnish presidency last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/7">The Council also adopted a range of Agriculture and Fisheries &quot;A&quot; points: labelling requirements for veal meat; a proposal amending the common organisation of the market in cereals by the abolition of maize intervention; multi-annual management plan for North sea sole and plaice; recovery measures for European eel; and a recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The UK could not offer its support to the compromise text on bluefin tuna. Despite voting against, the UK did manage to secure a joint Council-Commission declaration which should mean cases of overfishing are dealt with appropriately in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/8">The Council reached political agreement by qualified majority on a presidency compromise text establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets. The proposal consolidates the existing 21 sector-specific Common Market organisations into a single horizontal regulation. The UK voted in favour of the compromise text which satisfied the UK's principal concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/9">The Council also reached political agreement by qualified majority, with the UK voting in favour, on a set of measures to rebuild and manage the cod stocks in the Baltic sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/10">A number of issues, as follows, were raised under any other business:</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/11">The Council took note, without discussion, of a report provided by the presidency on the outcome of the conference of directors of EU paying agency, which was held in Postsdam, Germany. The Council also took note of a written update provided by the Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner on the state of play of discussions on proposals covering the marketing of plant protection products and on the sustainable use of pesticides.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/12">The ten new member states currently applying the single area payment scheme expressed concerns on the implementation of the system of cross-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/13">The Agriculture Commissioner updated Council on progress in the WTO agricultural negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/14">The Fisheries Commissioner set out the Commission's initial plans for handling the setting of the total allowable catches for 2008. He highlighted the importance of involving the full range of relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/15">Denmark expressed concerns about the operation of the existing management plan for the North sea sandeel fishery. The UK reminded the Commission about its interest, albeit limited, in the fishery and asked to be consulted when the management arrangements were reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="b.89WS.5/16">Finally, the UK expressed concerns regarding the continued illegal use of drift nets by a number of member states, following the ban agreed in 1992. The Commission explained that it took such illegal activity seriously and that it would make full use of its treaty powers to pursue any infringements.</p>

	<p pid="b.91WS.1/1">Charges to cover the costs of local enforcing authorities in regulating processes which are subject to Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Local Air Pollution Control (LAPC)) were introduced in April 1991. Interim charges for installations which are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 (Local Air Pollution Prevention and Control (LAPPC) and Local Authority - Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (LA-IPPC)) were introduced in August 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.91WS.1/2">With the approval of the Treasury, and following consultation with local authority associations and industry, I have revised the scheme specifying the scale of fees and charges in respect of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.91WS.1/3">This amendment to the scheme specifies the scale of fees and charges for certain petrol vapour recovery applications, namely, the application and subsistence fees that operators must pay for Stage II petrol vapour recovery (PVR II) systems at existing petrol stations. With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-15">15 June 2007</phrase> the application fee for PVR II will be &pound;91 and the subsistence fee for combined PVR I and PVR II will be &pound;202.</p>
	<p pid="b.91WS.1/4">The basis of these fees is set out in the consultation paper on &quot;The Implementation of the Petrol Vapour Recovery Stage II Controls&quot; which is available on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.91WS.1/5">The amendment has been laid before Parliament and copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.93WS.1/1">The majority of diplomatic missions in the United Kingdom pay the national non-domestic rates requested from them. They are obliged to pay only 6 per cent. of the total national non-domestic rates value, which represents payment for specific services such as street cleaning, lighting, maintenance and fire services. The total amount outstanding from all diplomatic missions is approximately &pound;821,000.00. However, as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, the missions listed below owed over &pound;10,000 in national non-domestic rates. Twelve additional diplomatic missions, who owe &pound;10,000 or more in respect of national non-domestic rates, have made arrangements with the Valuation Office Agency to clear their outstanding debts and have not been included in this list.</p>

	<p pid="b.94WS.1/1">In 2006, 15 serious offences allegedly committed by people entitled to diplomatic immunity were drawn to the attention of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. &quot;Serious Offences&quot; are defined as offences that would, in certain circumstances, carry a penalty of 12 months or more imprisonment.

	Inquests Into the Deaths of Servicemen

	<p pid="b.97WS.6/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following statement to the House about the inquests of servicemen and women who have died overseas where jurisdiction has been assumed by the Oxfordshire coroner, Nicholas Gardiner, and the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner, David Masters.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/2">All casualties suffered by the UK armed forces are a source of profound regret. UK service personnel have put their lives on the line to help build strong, stable and democratic nations and protect the interests of the United Kingdom and we cannot pay high enough tribute to the job they are doing, or the sacrifice some of them have made. We are committed to assisting the families of UK service personnel who have died on operations overseas when their loved ones are returned to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/3">We made statements to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-06-05.4WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 4WS</phrase>; <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-12">12 October 2006</phrase>,<i> Official Report</i>, column 26WS; <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-18">18 December 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-12-18.112WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 112WS</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-29">29 March 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-03-29.121WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 121WS</phrase>, with information about the conduct of inquests by the Oxfordshire coroner and today we are announcing progress which has been made since the written ministerial statement in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/4" class="italic">Background</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/5">Coroners are independent judicial officers appointed and paid for by the relevant local authority. Their officers and staff are employed by the local authority and/or the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/6">Each death of a serviceman or woman killed in an operation overseas whose body is repatriated to England and Wales is subject to an inquest. The inquest, both the investigation into the death and the holding of the public hearing into the death, is conducted by the coroner with jurisdiction which derives from where the body lies.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/7">In the case of deaths of servicemen and women whose bodies were flown into Brize Norton military airbase until it could no longer be used for repatriations on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, the Oxfordshire coroner has initial jurisdiction. In the case of deaths of servicemen and women whose bodies have been flown into Lyneham military airbase since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner has initial jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/8">The coroner has powers under the Coroners Act 1988 to transfer jurisdiction to another coroner while the body is still lying within his district and with the consent of the other coroner. Since late December 2006 the Oxfordshire coroner's practice was to transfer jurisdiction to coroners closer to the next of kin wherever possible; this practice has been continued by the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/9" class="italic">Progress with the Remaining Inquests</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/10">At the time of the March written ministerial statement, 56 inquests had been held, 46 into the deaths of servicemen and 10 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/11">A further 16 inquests have been held into the deaths of servicemen, making a total of 72 inquests which have been held since June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/12">Of these 72 inquests the Oxfordshire coroner, Nicholas Gardiner, has conducted five, Assistant Deputy Oxfordshire coroner Sir Richard Curtis six, Assistant Deputy Oxfordshire coroner Selena Lynch 28, Assistant Deputy Oxfordshire coroner Andrew Walker 32 and the Greater Manchester West Coroner Jennifer Leeming one.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/13" class="italic">Oxfordshire Coroner's Jurisdiction</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/14">There remain 11 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel in military conflicts and exercises overseas and four inquests into the deaths of civilians who lost their lives in Iraq and whose bodies were repatriated to Brize Norton before <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-16">16 May 2006</phrase>. This includes the death of a serviceman on an exercise in California in December 2005, details of which we have recently been advised by the coroner.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/15">The oldest outstanding military inquest in the Oxfordshire coroner's jurisdiction is the inquest into the death of Corporal Allbutt on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-25">25 March 2003</phrase> which will be heard on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June 2007</phrase>. The oldest outstanding civilian death inquest in the Oxfordshire coroner's jurisdiction is the inquest into the death of Antonio Jose Monteiro Abelha on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-22">22 June 2006</phrase>. This inquest will be heard on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-13">13 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.6/16">The four outstanding civilian inquests all have a hearing date. All but one of the outstanding inquests into servicemen's deaths before <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-16">16 May 2006</phrase> have a hearing date and these inquests are due to be heard by the end of October 2007. The MOD recently determined that there should be a board of inquiry in the case of Lieutenant Palmer who died on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase>. His inquest will not be heard until 2008.</p>

Of those retained by the Oxfordshire coroner, pre-inquest hearing dates have been set in 17 cases, hearing dates set in nine cases and progress made in the remainder. Of the 15 inquests which have been transferred to other coroners, progress has been made and dates set for three inquests.</p>

	<p pid="b.101WS.3/1">My noble friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy, Lord Truscott has made the following written statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/2">Following the Prime Minister's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-24">24 January</phrase> this year in relation to the recognition of the contribution made by the Bevin Boys who worked in the UK coalfields during and immediately after World War II I would like to update the House on the recent developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/3">Members will be aware that the Bevin Boys scheme was introduced in 1943 by then Minister for Labour and National Service, Ernest Bevin, in response to an increasing shortage of labour in the coal mining industry. The scheme ran between 1943 and 1948 and involved recruiting men aged between 18 and 25 years to work in coal mines rather than serve in the armed forces. Some 48,000 men worked in the mines under the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/4">I am delighted to announce that the DTI is launching today a lapel badge in recognition of the contribution this group made to the war effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/5">Of the 48,000 some 43 per cent. were conscripted directly into the mines and are known more generally as &quot;ballotees&quot;. The remaining 57 per cent. were those who opted for mine work in preference to joining the armed forces or those who were in the armed forces and volunteered to become miners. Only those who fall into these categories will be eligible for the badge.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/6">The Bevin Boys Badge is a survivors badge and I would encourage Bevin Boy veterans to wear it in public in order visibly to raise awareness of the important role they played during World War II and in the postwar reconstruction of the UK. Widows and estates will not eligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/7">The application process for the badge will be launched towards the end of the year. With a view to the first badge being awarded to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the demobilisation of the final Bevin Boys in March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/8">The DTI have worked closely with the Bevin Boys Association, who have expressed their extreme pleasure at the introduction, to ensure that the design of the badge suitably reflects the work they carried out. It is important that we never forget the sacrifices that were made both at home and abroad during the war, and this badge is a fitting way to remember the Bevin Boys' work to keep the coalfields going.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/9">A copy of the badge design has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.102WS.1/1">I have today launched a consultation document on improvements to regulation intended to support better payment practices in the construction industry. Copies are available in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/2">It has taken a long time to assemble these proposals following the publication of the DTI and Welsh Assembly Government's first consultation in March 2005.1 am delighted that we can now issue the second consultation we promised on &quot;Improving payment practices in the construction industry&quot;. I know how important it is for all in the construction industry that we have a system which delivers fair payment practices. The framework set out in Part II of the Housing Grants Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 has delivered improvement over the past nine years and it is important we build on this. I look forward to a healthy and constructive discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/3">The consultation document sets out a number of proposals on how we might seek to introduce greater clarity and transparency into the statutory payment framework to enable construction companies to manage cash flow better; and encourage parties to resolve disputes by adjudication.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/4">Prompt and fair payment practice throughout construction supply chains will help the construction industry to adopt integrated working as the norm.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/5">The proposals:</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/6" class="indent">improve transparency and clarity in the exchange of information relating to payments to enable the better management of cash flow;</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/7" class="indent">encourage the parties to resolve disputes by adjudication, where it is appropriate, rather than by resorting to more costly and time consuming solutions such as litigation; and improve the right to suspend performance under the contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/8">They do this by:</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/9">On adjudication</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/10" class="indent">improving access to the right to refer disputes for adjudication by:</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/11" class="indent">applying the legislation to oral and partly oral contracts</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/12" class="indent">preventing the use of agreements that interim payment decisions will be conclusive to avoid adjudication of interim payment disputes</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/13" class="indent">ensuring the costs involved in the process are fairly allocated</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/14">On payment</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/15" class="indent">preventing unnecessary duplication of payment notices</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/16" class="indent">clarifying the requirement to serve a section 110(2) payment notice</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/17" class="indent">clarifying the content of payment and withholding notices</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/18" class="indent">ensuring the payment framework creates a clear interim entitlement to payment</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/19" class="indent">prohibiting the use of pay when certified clauses</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/20">On suspension</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/21" class="indent">improving the statutory right to suspend performance by allowing the suspending party to claim the costs and delay which result.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/22">These proposals are intended to be proportionate amendments to the existing framework to address specific issues that have arisen during the nine years the Construction Act has been in operation. Guidance remains the preferred route to improve the operation of construction contracts and we have only considered further legislative intervention where we believe it is absolutely necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/23">Having emerged from the first consultation on &quot;Improving payment practices in the construction industry&quot; in 2005, these proposals were first outlined in the analysis of the consultation in January 2006. During 2006 a DTI appointed sounding board assisted in the development of the detailed proposals for this second consultation. I am very grateful for the work that the sounding board did.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/24">It was originally intended that these proposals should be introduced using a Legislative Reform Order (LRO) under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. But I have now concluded that it would be more appropriate to introduce these proposals using primary legislation. The consultation covers the primary legislative proposals in detail, as well as the consequential amendments that will need to be made to the Scheme for Construction Contracts (England and Wales) Regulations 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/25">We are now seeking the views of the construction industry and its clients on whether this package of proposals properly and adequately addresses the weaknesses in the existing framework, and how we might evaluate the costs and benefits of the package.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/26">We will be seeking to introduce legislation to implement the proposals emerging from this consultation through primary legislation as soon as a legislative slot is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.102WS.1/27">The consultation document is also available at: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/sectors/construction/constructionact/page13956.html/">www.dti.gov.uk/sectors/construction/constructionact/page13956.html/</a></p>
