	Trading In Financial Instruments
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-02-20c.10WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="10WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/wmstext/70220m0002.htm#07022067000742">
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/1">The Government are today announcing three steps to modernise the tax system to remove obstacles to competition and expand choice in trading financial instruments in the UK. They will allow firms to benefit from the new opportunities offered by liberalisation of financial regulation in the European Union, and specifically from the introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID).</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/2">First, from November 2007, the Government will no longer require transactions in shares admitted to trading on a regulated market under MiFID to be reported to that market, or those intermediaries to be members of that market, in order for intermediaries to benefit from stamp duty relief. Currently, relief from stamp duty is available for intermediaries that trade securities listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) only if they are members of the LSE and they report their trades to the LSE. This will allow new providers of transaction reporting services to enter the market more easily. The Government are today publishing draft clauses for consultation in advance of this year's Finance Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/3">Second, the Government are announcing that, in addition to shares admitted to trading on a regulated market, it also intends to extend this approach to include shares admitted to trading on a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF). Currently, in order to benefit from stamp duty relief, intermediaries trading in such securities are required to report transactions to the market on which the securities are admitted to trade. The Government intend to remove this requirement, in order to further extend choice in transaction reporting. However, before proceeding with this proposal, the Government are providing time for the Financial Services Authority to consider fully any possible regulatory implications from this change and will provide an update on progress at the Pre-Budget Report.</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/4">Third, the Government also propose to modernise the definition of a Recognised Stock Exchange for tax purposes to allow shares traded on other regulated markets under MiFID to benefit from the same tax arrangements that currently apply only to the LSE in the UK. For example, this will allow shares listed by the UK Listing Authority and traded on a regulated market under MiFID to be held in an Individual Savings Account or to meet the listing requirement to be a UK Real Estate Investment Trust. The Government will publish draft clauses in advance of this year's Finance Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/5">Taken together, these changes will help expand choice and increase competition in the provision of services to trade financial instruments in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/6">The Government have been a leading proponent of the need to improve competition and efficiency in Europe's securities markets for three reasons. First, to ensure that capital markets play their full role in financing the long-term investment needs of the wider economy as efficiently as possible. Second, to liberalise the provision of services to trade financial instruments within the EU so that successful firms and financial centres&mdash;such as London&mdash;can benefit from these opportunities within the European Single Market. Third, to ensure that the UK's markets and related services remain competitive internationally.</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/7">The Government have supported the introduction of greater competition through MiFID. The UK is the only major financial centre in the European Union to transpose the MiFID by the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January</phrase>. This gives UK-based financial firms the maximum time to prepare for the impact of the new trading environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/8">Today's announcement remove other unnecessary non-regulatory obstacles to greater competition in trading financial instruments by modernising the tax system to bring it closer into line with the liberalised regulatory environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/9">These announcements today coincide with an informal meeting of the High Level Group on City competitiveness, during which senior figures from the UK-based financial services sector met European Commissioners Charlie McCreevy and Neelie Kroes to discuss the future direction of financial services policy in Europe, including developments in trading securities.</p>

	Avian Influenza: Amendment to the General Permitted Development Order 1995 to allow Temporary Buildings or Extensions
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="c.18WS.1/1">Changes to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 for England came into force today introducing a new permitted development right to help mitigate the current increased risk of Avian Influenza ('bird flu').</p>
	<p pid="c.18WS.1/2">Following the recent outbreak of avian influenza on a farm in Suffolk, Defra have taken measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including the culling of all birds on the infected premises, putting in place a 3 km protection zone and a 10 km surveillance zone around the infected area and a restriction zone covering approximately 2090 km2 of North East Suffolk and South East Norfolk. In all of those zones, bird keepers are required to house their birds or, if that is not practical, otherwise isolate them from contact with wild birds.</p>
	<p pid="c.18WS.1/3">In order to help deal with the current increased risk of avian influenza nationwide, the Government have decided to assist poultry farmers and owners of other captive birds by granting planning permission in the whole of England for temporary and reversible works to shelter poultry and other captive birds from contact with wild birds. Landowners will be allowed to erect a building with a ground area of up to 465 square metres, or extend an existing building by up to 50 per cent. Any such development will be permitted to remain standing for as long as it is necessary to protect poultry and other captive birds from avian influenza, but not beyond 12 months. After such time the structures will either need to be removed and the land restored to its original condition or to any condition as agreed between the local planning authority and the developer or planning permission for a permanent structure will need to be sought.</p>
	<p pid="c.18WS.1/4">The amendment will also cover Conservation Areas, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Legislation protecting Listed Buildings and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) will continue to apply.</p>

	<p pid="c.36WS.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Attorney-General has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="c.36WS.2/2">The General Medical Council has started a hearing into allegations of professional misconduct by Professor David Southall, a consultant paediatrician. It is said that he kept so-called 'special case' files containing original medical records relating to his patients that were not also kept on the child's proper hospital file. Concerns have been raised that in some of those cases criminal proceedings may have been taken but the existence of the files not revealed, resulting in their not being disclosed as part of the prosecution process. I share those concerns.</p>
	<p pid="c.36WS.2/3">What is not clear at this stage is the nature and extent of the failure of disclosure, if such it be. I have therefore decided that I will conduct an assessment of the cases where Professor Southall was instructed as a prosecution witness to determine if any 'special case' files existed in any cases involving criminal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="c.36WS.2/4">Once that assessment has been completed, I will decide what, if any, further review is required.</p>

	<p pid="c.41WS.1/1">The Government are publishing a consultation paper today on Protecting Vulnerable Agency Workers. This consultation paper follows up the commitment to take forward measures identified in Success at Work, the Government's labour market strategy paper, published last year.</p>
	<p pid="c.41WS.1/2">The Government's intention is to address the bad practices that can affect the most vulnerable agency workers, but without placing burdens on the majority of reputable agencies, which would not use such practices, but are undercut by those who do. At the same time, in line with the Government's commitments on better regulation, we are seeking to reduce burdens on reputable agencies where we can do so without removing important protections for workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.41WS.1/3">Measures set out in the consultation document include giving workers a clear right to withdraw from accommodation, transport or other services provided by an agency without suffering any detriment, and banning the taking of fees at casting sessions held by talent-spotting agencies, and possibly for up to a week afterwards, to give would be entertainers and models the protection of a cooling off period. The Government also plan to make clear in guidance that driving agencies who flout the law and knowingly allow drivers to work beyond their hours can face criminal prosecution. In addition we will also provide potential EU migrant workers, who are at risk of being misled, with official advice on living in Britain before they leave, so they are aware of issues such as the cost of living before taking on loans to enable them to take up work in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.41WS.1/4">We will also introduce a measure to ease administrative burdens on agencies, by reducing the information requirements where they provide workers for very short assignments, of less than five days duration.</p>

	Consultation on smoke-free provisions on sea-going and inland waterways vessels
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-02-20c.41WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Scotland" colnum="41WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070220/wmstext/70220m0010.htm#07022079000776">
	<p pid="c.41WS.4/1">The Government announced last year that restrictions on smoking in enclosed workplaces, public places and vehicles would be introduced in England from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase>. These provisions are described in The Health Act 2006 which aims to act on medical and scientific advice. This will save thousands of lives over the next decade by reducing both exposure to hazardous second-hand smoke and overall smoking rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.41WS.4/2">The Health Act 2006 includes provisions designed to prohibit smoking in enclosed public places and vehicles, but does not cover vessels operating at sea or on inland waters. I now intend to introduce similar provisions to provide protection from second-hand smoke for people on vessels operating in UK waters, both at sea and on inland waterways.</p>
	<p pid="c.41WS.4/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-14">14 February</phrase> I launched a consultation paper asking for comments as to how smoke free provisions should be implemented on sea going and inland waterways vessels. The provisions, under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, will apply to all vessels operating in UK inland waters or within the 12 mile territorial waters regardless of which country they are flagged with providing they carry passengers or employees. I am also keen to see these provisions extended to Wales and Northern Ireland and for a consistent set of restrictions to be established in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="c.41WS.4/4">In line with the Health Act 2006, I am proposing that owners and operators of vessels may provide for residents and guests on merchant ships to be allowed to continue smoking in an entirely private area of residential accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.41WS.4/5">I am also proposing that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency hold the responsibility for enforcement of these provisions with a scale of penalties similar to those laid down in the Health Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.41WS.4/6">Copies of the consultation paper have been sent to a wide range of representatives in the shipping industry and they will have 12 weeks to respond to the consultation. Further copies of the consultation paper are available on the DfT website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a>. Copies have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.46WS.1/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase> in Brussels. There are no health or consumer affairs issues. I shall be representing the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.46WS.1/2">The first and main item is Preparation for the Spring European Council which will be held on the 8-<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March 2007</phrase>.

The Key Messages paper will be adopted following a policy debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.46WS.1/3">The second item is an information point from the Presidency on the content of the Tripartite Social Summit. This will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March</phrase> in advance of the Spring European Council to allow the European Social Partners to feed in their views to the Spring Council. Attendees are the current Presidency, the two subsequent Presidencies (Portugal and Slovenia), the Commission and the social partners.</p>

The exchange of views on &quot;Structuring the European Debate on demographic change&quot; will be the main discussion on the Council's agenda. I shall insist that Europe should avoid the temptation to set up new or duplicate processes at EU level where perfectly good mechanisms already exist. We need to place any new actions we take within the context of achieving greater growth and jobs and the existing open method of coordination. Within the context of demographic change in Europe, the Council will also be asked to adopt a resolution on the contribution of older people to economic and social development.</p>
	<p pid="c.46WS.1/5">Under Any Other Business, there is a Commission presentation on the &quot;New Community Strategy on Health and Safety at Work 2007-2013&quot;, which we expect to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase>. Also, the Committee Chairs will give an oral presentation of the 2007 Work Programmes of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee. The Council is informed annually about the Committees' work programmes.</p>
