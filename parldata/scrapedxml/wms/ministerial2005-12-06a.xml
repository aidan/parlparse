	<p pid="a.86WS.1/1">Ministry of Defence Votes A seek the maximum numbers of personnel to be maintained for service in the armed forces during each financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/2">As of <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>, we are amending the presentational format. The figures for the Commonwealth troops in the United Kingdom category will no longer be reported, and the numbers of the Queens Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps and Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service will be incorporated into those of the Regular Army and Regular Air Force.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/3">The Commonwealth Troops accounted for by the Army and RAF are members of Commonwealth Forces. The numbers are predominantly students attending courses, the remainder being those on exchange and attach&eacute; duties. The Commonwealth Troops, like those of other non-commonwealth nations, wear the uniform of and are paid and maintained by, their home nation. They are not members of the UK Armed Forces nor maintained for service with the UK Armed Forces and therefore fall outside the ambit of Votes A.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/4">Originally the Nursing Service were not a fully integrated part of the Services&mdash;being non-combatants&mdash;however they are now fully integrated and are now regarded as a sub-specialism and as such there is no longer appropriate to record these figures separately within Votes A.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-12-06a.87WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" speakeroffice="The Minister for Energy" colnum="87WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051206/wmstext/51206m01.htm#51206m01.html_spmin5">
	<p pid="a.87WS.4/1">I chaired, for the UK Presidency of the EU, the Energy Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December</phrase>. Alun Michael represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.87WS.4/2">The Council considered several matters of interest to the UK; chief among these were Better Regulation in the context of implementation of the EU's liberalised Electricity and Natural Gas market, Climate Change and Sustainable Energy, and EU Relations with Third Countries. There was an important and substantive debate throughout around the energy agenda discussed recently at Hampton Court, and the balance between our three key objectives of competitive markets, security of supply and tackling climate change. Member States recognised the important potential contribution from a European energy policy and supported Commission plans for taking this forward, through a Green Paper early in 2006, with a view to reporting to the <phrase class="date" code="">2006 December</phrase> European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.87WS.4/3">On market liberalisation, there was broad consensus that secure electricity and gas supplies at competitive prices, delivered on open, transparent and competitive markets are crucial to Europe's competitiveness; and that full implementation of the second electricity and gas directives was crucial. The Commission report on the internal energy market and the competition inquiry into the energy sector highlighted areas for more work, including more effective action by the Commission and national regulators against anti-competitive behaviour. Member States saw no need for further legislation until there had been more investigation into key issues such as market concentration, long-term contracts and the impact of the Emissions Trading Scheme. They agreed that the main issues for developing an effective internal energy market&mdash;such as independent and effective regulation, the development of regional markets, effective unbundling, and transparency&mdash;could be done within the existing framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.87WS.4/4">One Member State rejected the Commission analysis of market shortcomings, claiming that a period of regulatory stability was needed and that competition contributed to the ElTs energy problems as much as it helped to resolve them. Some Member States expressed concern at their dependence on particular energy suppliers, noting that similar liberalisation to the ElTs was needed in such countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.87WS.4/5">Council conclusions were agreed on climate change and energy efficiency. Energy efficiency was recognised as making an important contribution to the three primary energy objectives. Member States saw the expected agreement on the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive as welcome in this respect. Several Member States expressed concerns about the operation of the Emissions Trading Scheme and the need to revise the scheme before the next phase.</p>
	<p pid="a.87WS.4/6">On EU-third country relations, the Presidency and Commission summarised progress on dialogues with key energy partners. On Russia, the successful Permanent Partnership Council held in October signalled real hope of progress. There would be a second ministerial meeting with OPEC on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-02">2 December</phrase> to develop the dialogue begun earlier in the year and promote mutual understanding. The Energy Treaty signed with south-east European countries would establish a neighbouring regional market on the same lines as the EU internal market. A key issue at the Energy Charter Treaty's annual Conference on <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase> would be how to take forward the negotiations on the Transit Protocol.</p>

	<p pid="a.88WS.1/1">I chaired the Telecoms part of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council of the UK's EU presidency in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.88WS.1/2">The Council began informally over lunch, where I chaired a policy debate on the 2006 Review of the regulatory framework for Electronic Communications markets. The Council agreed that the Framework plays a key role in the development of open and competitive ICT markets. There was broad consensus that its implementation needs to be improved and that the Review of the Framework is a high priority for 2006. I was pleased that the Council gave a steer on the key issues for the Review. These included the importance of competition and investment in next generation networks, ensuring a light-touch regulatory approach and the importance of the needs of consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.88WS.1/3">The policy debate then continued in formal session with a focus on the future of EU spectrum policy. The Council agreed that spectrum is a valuable economic and social resource and that its management needs to be more flexible and efficient. However, views were divided about the role that market-based mechanisms and harmonisation should play in determining spectrum policy. There was broad support for further discussion and analysis on this important issue, particularly in light of the spectrum which will be released by the switchover from analogue television.</p>
	<p pid="a.88WS.1/4">I then chaired a policy debate on the Commission's i2010 Strategy. This was a public open session. I reported on the successful events held as part of our presidency, including the gathering of Chief Executives on 8&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-07-09">9 July</phrase> and the i2010 and e-accessibility conferences held in London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-06">6 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October</phrase> respectively. Evidence from the Disability Rights Commission prepared for the second of these conferences showed that websites that failed to meet the e-accessibility standards were 50 per cent. more difficult for all individuals to use, demonstrating that accessibility is an economic issue as well as an equalities issue. There was broad support for the i2010 Strategy and its three objectives to promote open and competitive markets, to strengthen ICT research and to achieve an inclusive information society. The Council discussed particular priority areas within the i2010 Strategy's three themes. These included the need for appropriate policy actions in the regulatory field, on broadband and content and on e-government and e-accessibility. There was agreement that the i2010 Strategy needs to be implemented effectively if its contribution to the Lisbon agenda is to be realised. I am pleased to report that at the end of this debate the Council adopted Council Conclusions on the i2010 Strategy and on e-accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.88WS.1/5">The Council also adopted Conclusions without debate on the subject of the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting. These Conclusions highlight the intention of Member States to complete the switchover, as far as possible, by the end of 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.88WS.1/6">Finally, I reported on the successful outcome on internet governance at the World Summit on Information Society and I highlighted the key role of the EU under our presidency in facilitating the compromise position. The agreement reached will provide a sound basis for delivering enhanced co-operation, and the response from the Commissioner and the Council was very positive indeed.</p>
