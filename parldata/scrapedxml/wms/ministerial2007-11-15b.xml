	<p pid="b.61WS.1/1">The Deputy UK Permanent Representative, Anne Lambert, will attend the Youth Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-16">16 November</phrase>. The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.1/2">Ministers will be asked to adopt a Resolution on implementing common objectives for voluntary activities of young people. The Resolution reflects one of the thematic priorities of the ongoing Open Method of Coordination for youth and also contributes to the joint Presidency priorities for 2007-08 of better social and professional integration of young people. The UK is broadly in favour of this document as it currently stands and particularly supports its emphasis on the positive contribution many young people make to society.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.1/3">Ministers are expected to agree Conclusions on a transversal approach to youth policy. The Conclusions call for a more cross-cutting, mainstreaming approach to youth policy across education and employment in the context of the Lisbon Agenda. The UK supports this approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.61WS.1/4">There will be an exchange of views on better consideration of youth issues in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy and implementing the European Youth Pact. The UK believes that the Youth Pact is best implemented through the National Reform Programmes and is anxious to avoid any additional burdens around youth-specific reporting.</p>

	Municipal Waste Policy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-15b.72WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="72WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071115/wmstext/71115m0006.htm#07111550000917">
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/1">Household waste recycling has quadrupled in the last 10 years and waste is growing much less quickly than the economy. Business has also been increasing its effort to reduce the amount of packaging it puts around the products that we buy. Last month we announced proposals for increased targets for recovery and recycling of packaging for 2008-12. In 2012 we now hope overall to see producers recycling and recovering 66 per cent. of all paper and 65 per cent. of all glass packaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/2">But we need to do more. Methane emissions from biodegradable waste in landfill count for about 3 per cent. of UK greenhouse gas emissions. We still lag behind much of mainland Europe in recycling and we will face EU fines if we exceed landfill limits.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/3">In May, we announced a revised Waste Strategy for England. It set out new ways for us all to reduce, reuse and recycle our waste for the sake of the environment. Incentives appeared as part of that strategy and we consulted on possible schemes to help local authorities influence residents' behaviour at a local level. These schemes were similar to those that had been successful in both Europe and in North America. The UK is currently the only EU15 country that prevents authorities from trialling or putting in place these type of incentives schemes. The Local Government Association and local authorities from across the political spectrum have called for powers to introduce similar schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/4">Following on from the consultation, we announced in the Climate Change Bill Command Paper that we would provide in the Bill a power for a small number of local authorities to pilot incentives for household waste minimisation and recycling. I am today announcing the detail of these proposals, which for the first time will mean that authorities will be able both positively to reward those who recycle and charge those who do not.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/5">A maximum of five local authorities will be granted permission to pilot the schemes. Councils will be able to come forward with schemes to fit local circumstances but they will have to be approved by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and will need to be consistent with the framework set out in legislation. This approach will allow us to monitor the impacts of the pilots and report back to Parliament before a decision is made whether to roll them out more widely. Parliament would have a say in any final decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/6">The framework covers a range of issues. First of all, since we are keen to avoid placing additional burdens on local residents, it says that if the authority collects any revenue through a scheme this must be returned to residents so residents as a whole will not be paying more. To further reduce the burden on both the public and local authorities, we are also enabling authorities to pay back rebates, and collect any payments, through Council Tax, should they wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/7">We have also built in further simple checks and balances to help ensure the right level of public protection. These are not about restricting local authorities' behaviour, as we continue to believe that they are in the best position to understand what is right for their area. Instead they are about helping the public to understand better what they might expect to see in a pilot scheme regardless of where they are in the country. For example, pilots could only be introduced where there was a good kerbside recycling service in place, and we ask that authorities take account in their plans of the needs of, or impacts on, potentially disadvantaged groups - for example young families. We also think that it is sensible for pilot authorities to review their policies for tackling flytipping, and to have a flytipping prevention strategy in place. Evidence from other countries where financial incentives schemes operate suggests that an increase in fly tipping is not an automatic consequence of introducing them, but having a strategy in place is good common sense. Government intend to retain a reserved power to create a cap in the future on the level of incentive, should this be necessary. We consider that this power provides a further protection for households.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/8">Climate Change means that each of us needs to look at what we currently do and think hard about what more we could do both inside and outside the home. This includes working together to reduce the amount of waste we generate. Our plan for incentives for waste fits into this.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/9">To support this work on guidance and pilots, the Government will be making &pound;1.5 million available every year for the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/10">Copies of the summary of consultation responses and impact assessment have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The documents are also available on the website of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.73WS.2/23">Iraq</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/24">The Council is expected to discuss EU engagement with Iraq.

	<p pid="b.73WS.2/38">Operation EUFOR ALTHEA (Bosnia-Herzegovina)</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/39">The political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has deteriorated over the last year, leading the EU to postpone signature of BiH's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (the first of many steps towards EU membership) in October 2007, following the collapse of police reform talks. The Government believe the EU and the international community should continue to encourage leaders in Bosnia to exercise restraint and to continue to engage in dialogue with each other and with the High Representative.</p>

	<p pid="b.73WS.2/45">Development and Security</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/46">The Council will adopt Conclusions on Development and Security in four areas: Strategic Planning, Security Sector Reform, the EU-Africa partnership on Security and Development and Humanitarian Aid.

Ministers will discuss the consequences and impacts of the strategy on EU external action, on the basis of a Presidency paper. The Government will push for agreement of the strategy and action plans and continues to push for action on Millennium Development Goals, climate change and peace and security. We expect Member States to be supportive of the strategic partnership and its goals, and to commit to implementation of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/50">Towards an EU response to situations of fragility</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/51">The Council will adopt Conclusions on the development of an EU policy and improved practices on the situation of Fragile States. The EU's response to fragile situations is critical as fragile states pose a great challenge, both in terms of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and in terms of global and regional security. The Government support the implementation of the measures proposed in the Commission's communication to increase coordination and coherence.</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/52">Policy coherence for development</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/53">The Council is expected to adopt Conclusions on policy coherence for development, including on climate change and migration. The discussion is expected to focus on the launch of the EU's first two-yearly report, reporting on the extent to which EU Member States have fulfilled their commitments to integrate development concerns within broader policymaking and highlighting key outstanding issues for the next reporting period.</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/54">Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/55">The Council will discuss the Commission's Communication on Economic Partnership Agreements. The core of the Commission's strategy is to agree goods-only agreements this year ahead of the deadline on the <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase> before returning to services and other trade related areas in the future. The Government want to ensure that EPAs deliver on their development potential. The Government will also want to make clear that the African Caribbean and Pacific countries should not be bound to taking commitments on non-goods issues. It is their choice to negotiate on those elements.</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/56">Advancing Agriculture in Africa</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/57">The Council is expected to discuss the Advancing African Agriculture Strategy proposal for continental and regional-level cooperation on agricultural development in Africa, which the Government support. A better aligned and coherent EU response will help Africa to achieve its goal of agricultural-led growth, a more predictable response to dealing with hunger, and be better equipped to respond to the challenges presented by climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/58">Partnership with Cape Verde</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/59">The Council is expected to discuss a Partnership between the EU and the Republic of Cape Verde, a small Portuguese speaking island off the coast of West Africa. In line with the Cotonou Agreement this anticipates that Cape Verde will become a partner in increased police and judicial cooperation with Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/60">AOB: Ratification on the Cotonou Partnership Agreement</p>
	<p pid="b.73WS.2/61">EU Member States need to ratify the revised EU's Partnership Agreement with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States (known as the 'Cotonou Agreement') and the 10th European Development Fund (EDF), by the end of 2007 in order for both to come into effect. Member States who have not already done so will be encouraged to conclude their ratification processes as soon as possible. The Government completed their ratification process in September.</p>

	<p pid="b.78WS.4/1">The Independent Sector is playing an important and increasing role within the NHS, providing high quality treatment and choice for patients, and innovation, dynamism and contestability for existing National Health Service providers. Alongside the hard work of staff in every organisation, the use of the independent sector is an integral part of our success in delivering dramatic falls in waiting times for patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/2">That is why we have taken a number of measures to make better use of the independent sector:</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/3" class="indent">In the first wave of the independent sector treatment centre (ISTC)programme we established 23 fixed site ISTCs, a mobile ophthalmology service, a mobile MRI scanning service, a chlamydia screening service and six walk-in centres. This investment worth over &pound;1.4 billion has provided nearly 800,000 elective procedures, diagnostic assessments and episodes of primary care to NHS patients and is helping to reduce waiting times in those areas. I am today providing further information on each first wave scheme, including the contract value, volume of activity, case mix by volume and utilisation rates, and in future this data will be published annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/4" class="indent">There has been rapid growth in patients choosing to be referred to the 129 independent sector hospitals currently registered under the Extended Choice scheme. The value of activity has doubled in the last month alone. From April 2008, all patients referred for an elective procedure will be able to choose to go to any hospital in England which meets NHS standards and price. This already applies for orthopaedics and from December will cover general surgery, gynaecology and cardiology.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/5" class="indent">We are procuring additional GP services through the Fairness in Primary Care initiative from a range of providers including the independent sector, and as announced last month we will be inviting bidders for further primary care contracts as we roll out new GP-led health centres and extra GP surgeries in deprived areas. In addition, we are offering primary care trusts the opportunity to use independent sector expertise in developing their commissioning function.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/6">As I said to the Health Select Committee in July, independent sector procurement will have to meet the local needs of patients and offer sound value for money for taxpayers. Where it meets these requirements we will increase the role of the independent sector in the provision of NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/7">The Department has therefore undertaken a thorough revalidation of all the schemes currently being procured nationally through the ISTC programme to ensure they meet these objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/8">The Director General of the Commercial Directorate has advised that I proceed with the procurement of the following schemes:</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/9" class="indent">PET CT North Diagnostics (additional CT scans);</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/10" class="indent">PET CT South Diagnostics (additional CT scans);</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/11" class="indent">Renal (provision of dialysis treatment);</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/12" class="indent">Hampshire and Isle of Wight Electives (Southampton element);</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/13" class="indent">Greater Manchester (B) Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/14" class="indent">Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire Electives;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/15" class="indent">Essex Electives;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/16" class="indent">Hertfordshire Electives;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/17" class="indent">Greater Manchester (A) Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services; and</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/18" class="indent">London North Electives.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/19">I am pleased to announce that three of these: PET-CT North, PET-CT South and the Renal scheme have been approved to move to financial close. The Department will conclude decisions on the remaining schemes no later than the end of March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/20">However the director general has concluded that the following schemes should not proceed as they were unlikely to provide acceptable value for money as the local NHS has successfully improved capacity to meet patients' needs. These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/21" class="indent">North East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire Referral Assessment Diagnostics and Treatment Service;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/22" class="indent">North East Diagnostics;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/23" class="indent">South East Diagnostics;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/24" class="indent">Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridge Electives;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/25" class="indent">Cumbria and Lancashire Clinical Assessment and Treatment Service; and</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/26" class="indent">Hampshire and Isle of Wight Electives (Lymington element).</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/27">In addition, the Director General has advised that the contract with Care UK for the provision of diagnostic services in the West Midlands should be terminated because of an unacceptably low rate of use (5 per cent. utilisation to date), and a very low prospect of the utilisation increasing which represents poor value for money to the taxpayer. In short. a significant increase in productivity by local NHS providers has substantially reduced the need for the capacity provided by this scheme with waiting times for most diagnostics reduced from more than one year to currently three weeks on average.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/28">The reduction in the overall size of the procurement does not represent a change in policy. As I have stated before, we will continue to use the independent sector. However, as I said to the Health Select Committee, we will now move towards greater local procurement of services. This will enable primary care trusts to take procurement decisions quickly on behalf of their patients rather than waiting for a prolonged process run from Whitehall. We believe this will be a more effective route for increasing the quality of the role which the independent sector is able to provide in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/29">To support this move I am announcing today the establishment of an Independent Sector Procurement Forum as a means for Independent and Third Sector providers to advise the Department on policies and practices related to local procurement of clinical services in order to ensure a level playing field.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/30">The forum will draw on a range of expertise and experience, including Ivan Bradbury of In Health Netcare and Sir Ian Carruthers of the South West Strategic Health Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/31">The forum will be advisory and act as a channel for the market to communicate and advise the Department on PCT procurement policies and practices.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/32">We remain committed to choice, to empower patients and drive improvements in the quality of care. For choice to be truly effective, and for all providers to be able to compete fairly, it is essential that all patients are aware that they can now choose the hospital they are referred to. In the run up to the start of free choice, we will raise public awareness of choice through, for example, NHS Choices and other means, as well as encouraging local providers to inform patients about the local choices available to them, and publishing a Code of Promotion to help guide them in this.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/33">To ensure fairness we will also,</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/34" class="indent">publish clear competition principles and simple rules for commissioners and providers to apply consistently for all those that provide services on behalf of the NHS, including social enterprise and third sector organisations as well as the independent sector;</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/35" class="indent">establish a competition panel to provide independent advice on competition issues to SHAs, which they would be excepted to follow working closely with their PCTs. The panel will only consider issues where action to resolve issues have been exhausted; and</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/36" class="indent">seek to open up membership of the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) to many non-NHS providers of NHS care.</p>
	<p pid="b.78WS.4/37">Our approach to the Independent Sector is pragmatic not ideological. Where independent sector providers offer good value for money, innovation, and high quality patient care, we will continue to bring them in to work as part of the family of NHS providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.81WS.1/15">The increase in net total resources and capital is by a take up of End Year Flexibility (EYF) of &pound;9,800,000. Of this &pound;4,100,000 is an increase in near cash administration costs, which will be used to fund restructuring of the Food Standards Agency's headquarters operations and related accommodation and support services costs. Near cash programme costs increase by &pound;4,400,000 to assist with the restructuring of the Meat Hygiene Service. The balance of &pound;1,300,000 is an increase in capital and will be used to fund an increased investment in IT hardware and infrastructure.

	<p pid="b.93WS.2/1">The Government have today laid before Parliament &quot;Working Together to Cut Crime and Deliver Justice: A Strategic Plan for Criminal Justice 2008-11&quot;(Cm 7247). This plan sets out how we will deliver the new Justice for All Public Service Agreement targets for the Criminal Justice System to improve efficiency and effectiveness in bringing offences to justice, especially serious offences; increase public confidence and victim and witness satisfaction; increase recovery of criminal assets and improve enforcement of the orders of the court.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/2">The strategic plan sets out a new approach to the way in which the criminal justice agencies&mdash;police, prosecution, courts, probation, prison and youth justice services&mdash;will work together to improve efficiency and effectiveness in bringing offences to justice by giving Local Criminal Justice Boards greater flexibility to tailor their work to local priorities. The Plan also sets out how the Criminal Justice System will support the Government's wider drive to make communities safer through reducing crime and re-offending, as detailed in the Crime Strategy: Cutting Crime: A New Partnership 2008-11, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/3">By working together more closely, staff in the Criminal Justice System have already successfully brought more offences to justice, improved services to victims and witnesses and built strong partnerships sat national and local level to drive up performance, supported by modern technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/4">This plan builds on that success and sets out our commitment to a Criminal Justice System which:</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/5" class="indent">is effective in bringing offences to justice</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/6" class="indent">engages the public and inspires confidence</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/7" class="indent">puts the needs of victims at its heart; and has</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/8" class="indent">simple and efficient processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/9">While we have made great strides in tackling volume crime, there is more to do to tackle some of the most serious crimes, such as sexual and violent crime and support the victims of these crimes. At the other end of the scale, we need to intervene earlier and more effectively with young people at risk, both victims and offenders. We need to continue our drive to tackle some of the most intractable problems - mental health, substance misuse and social exclusion - which underlie many crimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/10">We recognise that it is crucial to engage the public more closely in the work of the Criminal Justice System. We need to bring the Criminal Justice System closer to the people it serves so that we inform them, consult them and tell them how we are responding to their views. Local Criminal Justice Boards, working with local communities and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships will have a key role in achieving this. More needs to be done to ensure that the Criminal Justice System provides a service which is fair and effective for all sections of the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/11">We will go further in improving the efficiency of every part of the system making better use of the technology that is now in place, and give local areas title freedom to innovate and drive locally-tailored programmes of change.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/12">The programmes of work we set out in this plan will support this local approach. We are designing a blueprint for local leadership to enable Local Criminal Justice Boards to implement a co-ordinated programme of reform which is shared by all the criminal justice agencies and engage effectively with local communities and local partners to tackle local priorities and reduce crime and re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/13">We have set ourselves a challenging target on asset recovery sending a strong signal that crime does not pay. Offenders will be held to account for their actions and offered more opportunities to make amends to their victims and society. We will ensure that standards of service to victims and witnesses are embedded throughout the Criminal Justice System and that we respond to the needs of all victims, particularly the victims of the most serious crimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/14">We will continue to drive improvements across the whole criminal justice process. But we will do so in a different way. At a national level we will provide the framework and support, but improvements will be driven at local level, informed by local priorities. We will measure and respond to the views of local people about their local services. We will work in partnership with local community and voluntary organisations. We will build on what works to make a sustainable difference to reducing crime and re-offending in communities.</p>

	Disability Living Attendance Allowances

	<p pid="b.112WS.4/1">Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA) are paid to people with extra needs arising from their disabilities. These benefits are administered by the Disability and Carers Service. Where people have reached state pension age and are receiving state pension or pension credit, normal practice is to combine the payment of AA or DLA with state pension and pension credit so that the customer receives one combined weekly payment of benefit. These combined payments are administered by The Pension Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.4/2">The Department is responsible for administering more than 1.6 million such cases. It has recently been identified that over a period dating from 1996, there are just over 4,000 cases where our customers have been paid in error by both The Pension Service and the Disability and Carers Service. The total amount overpaid is estimated to be some &pound;26 million. Steps have already been taken to prevent such duplicate payments occurring in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.4/3">It is clearly right that where duplicate payments are being made the position should be corrected. However, given that the customers involved are both elderly and disabled, I have decided not to seek recovery of past overpayments, some of which go back as far as 1996, in cases where the customer clearly did not know they were being overpaid.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.4/4">I recognise that some people will need help in adjusting their finances to the reduced, albeit correct, level of benefit We believe that a very small number of the cases, around 50, involve people with a terminal illness and I judge it would not be appropriate to cause them and their families additional worry. In these cases, I propose to make ex-gratia payments to maintain the higher level of payment. Based on information held by the Department the estimated cost will be no more than &pound;200,000 in a full year.</p>
	<p pid="b.112WS.4/5">In all other cases I propose, at the same time as stopping the duplicate payment, to make in each case an ex-gratia payment of between &pound;100 and &pound;350, depending on the length of time they have been overpaid. Beyond that further ex-gratia payments will be considered on an individual basis in case of exceptional needs. The total cost of making the ex-gratia payments outlined above is estimated to be no more than &pound;1.3 million.</p>
