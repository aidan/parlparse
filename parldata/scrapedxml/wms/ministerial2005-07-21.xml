<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-21.115WS.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" speakername="John Reid" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="115WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050721/wmstext/50721m03.htm#50721m03.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".115WS.3/1">The Ministry of Defence has been reviewing how best to organise elements of our supply chain in order to provide the armed forces with the necessary logistic support in a modern environment. I am today able to announce the outcome of a number of studies into logistic support arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/2">The Future Defence Supply Chain initiative aims to deliver a modern and effective Defence Supply Chain focused on meeting the demands of today's armed forces both in peace-time and in support of operations. MOD has been evaluating four alternatives and has selected an in-House option worked-up in close consultation with the trades unions to provide the best possible combination of effectiveness and cost. By updating processes, improving training for staff, rationalising the distribution network and the closure of the storage depots at Stafford by the end of 2007, Llangennech by mid-2008, and Longtown by mid-2009 we expect to make savings of over &pound;50 million per year by 2010 and over &pound;400 million over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/3">The new organisation will require around 2,000 fewer civilian posts and around 50 fewer armed forces personnel. These reductions will contribute to the wider MOD manpower reductions announced in the 2004 White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/4">A study into the future role of the Defence Munitions Centre at Crombie in Dumferline West is now complete and I have decided, subject to consultation with the national trades unions, to implement the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/5">The study determined that the explosives storage capacity available at DMC Crombie is not required to meet the known and projected storage liability of its customers. Crombie will, in future, concentrate on providing a loading/off-loading function to HM Ships and Royal Fleet Auxiliaries, together with berthing and other jetty operations.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/6">DMC Crombie currently employs 168 staff. If the recommendations of the Study are implemented, there would be a reduction of 142 posts at the site. It is anticipated that 67 posts would go in the first year, with the balance of 75 posts being phased over years 2006&ndash;07 to 2009&ndash;10. Implementation of the study recommendations has the potential to deliver savings in the order of &pound;18.1 million over a 10 year period.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/7">I have also today approved, subject to conclusion of trade union consultation, ABRO's proposal, to begin phase one of a two part rationalisation programme. Phase one addresses the immediate impact of the downturn in ABRO's Defence revenue projections, but will not diminish the range of capabilities ABRO is currently able to deliver to the front line.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/8">As a result, ABRO will reduce its headcount to approximately 2,150 posts by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>, which includes the potential for up to 246 redundancies. The changes will realise annual manpower cost savings in the region of &pound;2.1 million in 2005&ndash;06, and &pound;8.3 million per year thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/9">ABRO are still developing phase two of the programme but the aim is to address the process efficiencies, site re-structuring, and other change initiatives required to ensure ABRO has a sustainable competitive position from which it can grow in the medium term.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/10">Finally, as a direct consequence of an announcement made today by Rolls-Royce Defence Aerospace on the outcome of an open competition for future overhaul and component repair on RB199 engine modules, up to 50 jobs will be lost at the Defence Aviation Repair Agency's (DARA) Engines Business Unit at Fleetlands in Gosport, Hampshire. I have agreed that DARA can now begin the formal 30-day consultation process with the trades unions.</p>
	<p pid=".115WS.3/11">We are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact on the people affected by these announcements. Our current plans envisage that the majority of civilian reductions will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early release but some compulsory redundancies may prove necessary. There will be no redundancies from the armed forces. Staff and the trade unions are being kept fully informed of developments through meetings, briefings and formal consultation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-21.120WS.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government" colnum="120WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050721/wmstext/50721m04.htm#50721m04.html_spmin2">
	<p pid=".120WS.3/1">I am pleased to announce the final details of the Local Authority Business Growth Incentives scheme (LABGI), which will make its first payment in February 2006. The scheme allows local authorities to retain a share of increased business rates revenue generated in their area. By creating a direct financial incentive for local authorities to encourage business growth in their locality, LABGI provides the opportunity for local government and business to work together to deliver economic success and prosperity to their local community.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/2">In our consultations we have set out five principles for the scheme, which the Government remains committed to:</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/3" class="indent">that the scheme should give all local authorities an incentive to maximise local economic growth;</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/4" class="indent">that the scheme will give local authorities additional revenues to spend on their own priorities;</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/5" class="indent">that the incentive should be consistent with Government aims for growth in all regions of the country and reductions in the persistent gap in performance between regions;</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/6" class="indent">that the distribution of benefits must be fair, reflecting relative performance not relative circumstances; and</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/7" class="indent">that the scheme should be as intelligible and transparent as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/8">Following the announcement of the scheme in the Chancellor's 2002 pre-Budget report, consultations have been held in 2003 and 2004 and volunteer local authorities also took part in a dry-run exercise to test out the administration of the scheme. All responses to the consultations and the experiences from the test exercise have been carefully considered and taken into account in the details of the scheme I am confirming today.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/9">Business growth is measured in terms of the increase in a local authority's rateable value during a calendar year. A single payment will be made to each eligible local authority in the final quarter of the financial year. The scheme operates as an unringfenced grant under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003: authorities are free to spend the revenue on their own priorities in their own areas. Administering the scheme in this way was broadly welcomed in the recent consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/10">The starting point for each authority is their rateable value at <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>. An authority's rateable value figure will not be reduced by successful appeals. Empty and part-empty property reliefs will be netted off, using the most recent set of audited data from the authority's normal National Non Domestic Rates (NNDR) return.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/11">Each authority has a target level of rateable value growth that must be reached to benefit from LABGI&mdash;known as the floor. The floor is defined as an authority's baseline growth rate minus a national adjustment factor. Baselines are calculated using a National Historic Growth Model&mdash;the preferred model from the first consultation. This has been modified by dividing all the authorities into eight baseline groups based on historical growth rate, rather than seven as previously announced. Feedback from the second consultation highlighted a fairer split was necessary and we have accepted this argument.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/12">The other features of the scheme are the same as the Government set out in the final consultation paper and which received broad support.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/13">There is a national adjustment factor for all baseline groups of 1.4 per cent. At the end of the first year a new list of rateable values will be produced by the Valuation Office Agency, as at <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2005</phrase>, not including appeals, but net of empty and part-empty property reliefs. This will be compared to the starting list from <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase> to calculate each local authority's growth rate. Growth above the floor is then multiplied by the business rate multiplier. A scaling factor of 70 per cent. is applied to all revenues above the floor to calculate the final amount eligible locally. Each authority has a ceiling&mdash;the maximum revenue that can be kept in any year&mdash;with money above the ceiling being passed back to the central business rates pool for distribution between all authorities. An authority's gains in one year in excess of the ceiling will be counted against the following year's target. The ceiling is based on a modified version of part of the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) element of the Formula Spending Share (FSS) from the local authority's Revenue Support Grant calculation.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/14">The ceilings in the first three years of the scheme will be 3 per cent., 6 per cent. and 9 per cent. of modified EPCS FSS, respectively. In two-tier areas, LABGI revenues will be shared out according to each tier's contribution to the total ceiling amount. In London, revenues will remain with the boroughs.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/15">To prevent authorities that fail to gain money in one year having an unrealistic growth target the next year, their floor will be re-based and a new lower floor will be calculated. This will maintain the incentive effect of the scheme for all authorities. Feedback from the recent consultation suggested that re-basing floors was a positive modification to the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".120WS.3/16">The scheme puts in place the right incentives for local government to work with local business and promote economic growth in its area. This will encourage local government to build effective partnerships with local business, to help deliver increased prosperity and to build long-term economic sustainability for its locality. Local authorities stand to gain up to &pound;1 billion in England and Wales over three years&mdash;this is genuinely additional and unringfenced.</p>

	<p pid=".124WS.3/1">I am announcing today the publication of consultation drafts of four annexes to Minerals Policy Statement 1 (MPS1) &quot;Planning and Minerals&quot;. These deal with &quot;Aggregates provision in England&quot;, &quot;Brick clay provision in England&quot;, &quot;Natural building and roofing stone in England&quot; and &quot;Onshore oil and gas in England&quot;. These set out the planning policies that Government considers should be followed by local authorities, the minerals industry, and other stakeholders to ensure that the supply of these minerals is achieved at acceptable cost to society, including environmental costs, and to help protect the environment, in the interests of sustainable development. They should be read in conjunction with MPS1. That document, which contains the over-arching principles for minerals planning, will be finalised in the light of consultation carried out on it in winter 2004&ndash;05 and on these annexes.</p>
	<p pid=".124WS.3/2">When finally published, the annex &quot;Aggregates provision in England&quot; will, together with the guidelines for aggregates provision issued in June 2003 and parts of MPS1, complete the review and revision of Minerals Planning Guidance Note 6 &quot;Guidelines for aggregates provision in England&quot;, published in 1994. When finalised, the annex &quot;Onshore oil and gas in England&quot; will replace DOE Circular 2/85 &quot;Planning control over oil and gas operations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".124WS.3/3">The draft annexes to MPS1 take account of relevant legislative changes since earlier guidance was issued including the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act (2004). They contribute to the Government's sustainable development objectives for planning and the creation of sustainable communities, by helping to secure the necessary supplies of minerals, particularly for construction, while seeking to minimise the effects of mineral working on local communities and the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".124WS.3/4">Consultation on the draft annexes to MPS1 will run until <phrase class="date" code="">31 October 2005</phrase>. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid=".127WS.2/1">On 12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July</phrase>, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Ruth Kelly) chaired an informal meeting in London of Education Ministers from the EU, accession, candidate and EEA countries to look at how skills can contribute to raising productivity and therefore to the Lisbon goals for jobs and growth.</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/2">The meeting consisted of four sessions, which considered:</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/3" class="indent">(1) Sector skills</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/4" class="indent">My right hon. Friend (Ms Kelly) outlined our presidency focus on highlighting how education and skills can contribute to the Lisbon agenda and the importance of skills responding to the needs of employers. Ministers discussed national experiences in developing sector-based approaches as a mechanism for employers to express skills requirements and to link education and training with labour market requirements in a knowledge economy.</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/5" class="indent">There was consensus that employers should be involved in both designing and delivering vocational training courses, but only a few Member States involved employers in academic education. Ministers agreed that vocational training should be made more attractive to learners.</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/6" class="indent">(2) European Qualifications Framework</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/7" class="indent">This session was focused on a presentation by Commissioner Figel of the European Commission's consultation on a proposed European Qualifications Framework. This would provide a tool for improved understanding of qualifications from different countries. This should help mobility of learners and workers and thereby alleviate skills gaps. The Commission consultation is planned to last until the end of the year. The idea was welcomed by ministers, but they underlined that it should be user-friendly and must be implemented on a voluntary basis. Commissioner Figel explained that the Commission would propose a Council and Parliament Recommendation next spring.</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/8" class="indent">(3) The Relationship of Skills to Productivity</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/9" class="indent">The presidency tabled a paper, prepared by the four UK Government Skills Alliance Departments and agreed jointly with the European Commission. This sets out evidence for the contribution of skills to increasing productivity. It also raises questions for ministerial discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/10" class="indent">Ministers discussed skills in a panel session with representatives from industry. John Monks, General Secretary ETUC, explained that unions could be ambassadors for learning. He pointed out that employees were often nervous about undertaking training, as they were worried about failing. Philippe de Buck, Secretary General of the EU-wide employers' organisation, UNICE, argued that governments needed to provide more support for training in companies particularly for SMEs. Bill Thomas, a member of the UK's ICT Sector Skills Council, underlined the importance of businesspeople understanding how ICT could be used to improve productivity.</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/11" class="indent">Ministers agreed that economies would increasingly need highly skilled people, but also underlined the importance of having good basic skills as a foundation for achieving this.</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/12" class="indent">(4) Possible Next Steps</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/13" class="indent">The meeting concluded with Ministerial discussion groups. I chaired one group, with other groups chaired by Phil Hope MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Skills, and Allan Wilson MSP, Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".127WS.2/14">During these groups, Ministers agreed that: skills needs should be addressed at a sectoral and regional level; better recognition of informal and non-formal learning was needed: and that businesses should be encouraged to invest more in training their employees. There was an interest in member states continuing to share experiences and learn from each other on sector-based approaches. There was also recognition that Education Ministers should explore ways of working across Government, with other Ministers with an interest in skills and productivity, and that Education Ministers should be closely involved drawing up Lisbon National Action Plans.</p>

	<p pid=".139WS.2/1">My hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-25">25 January 2005</phrase>, <i>Official Report,</i> column WS165, that the Government were intending to set up a Government Decontamination Service (GDS), as an executive agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The decision was part of cross-government work to ensure that the UK is prepared for a range of emergencies and has been developed as part of the CBRN Resilience Programme led by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/2">The new service will be launched on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2005</phrase>. Robert Bettley-Smith, a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has been appointed as its chief executive.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/3">The service will have four principal functions to ensure the UK has a highly effective decontamination capability.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/4">Firstly, the service will provide high quality advice and guidance to responsible authorities during their contingency planning for CBRN, significant HAZMAT incidents and during actual incidents, and regularly help validate and test the arrangements that are in place.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/5">Secondly, the service will work hand in hand with specialist suppliers and advisers to rigorously assess the ability of companies in the private sector to carry out decontamination operations, and ensure that responsible authorities have ready access to those services if the need arises. If required, the GDS will also help co-ordinate decontamination operations.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/6">Thirdly, the service will work with Government Departments, responsible authorities, specialist suppliers, research organisations and other nations to improve decontamination technologies and capabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/7">Finally, the service will be the Government's eyes and ears on the national capability for the decontamination of buildings, infrastructure, mobile transport assets and the open environment, will be a repository of information, and a source of expertise in the event of CBRN incident or major release of HAZMAT materials. The GDS will regularly review the United Kingdom's capability gaps.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/8">The GDS will provide a service in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as in England. In Scotland CBRN resilience is devolved. Scottish Ministers decided that the GDS should be invited to provide a service in Scotland and the Scottish Executive has been actively involved in its establishment. A similar statement will therefore be made in the Scottish Parliament. The Welsh Assembly Government is not responsible for CBRN resilience under the terms of the devolved settlement in Wales but has been fully consulted and supports the development of the GDS.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/9">The following key performance targets to deliver these functions have now been agreed for the Service's first six months of operation:</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/10" class="indent">The GDS will put in place the first framework of contracts with specialist suppliers who have CBRN decontamination expertise, and as far as possible ensure the framework is scientifically robust, by the end of October 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/11" class="indent">The GDS will have defined its operational structure, role and response arrangements, agreed them with our stakeholders and secured the approval of the Ownership Board, by the end of March 2006. The GDS will have put in place a comprehensive training programme for its staff, by the end of December 2005, who will be fully engaged in CBRN response preparation and planning with stakeholders through participation in Regional Resilience Forum CBRN working groups and their equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by the same date.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/12" class="indent">The GDS will have established effective working relationships with centres of excellence for scientific advice on CBRN hazards and their decontamination through mechanisms such as memoranda of understanding or the establishment of regular exchanges of information, by the end of October 2005. The GDS will have created a database of information on contaminants, their effects and relevant decontamination techniques for use within the GDS, and introduced a programme to ensure that it is reviewed and updated regularly, by the end of December 2005. The GDS will be working with other Government Departments by July 2005, particularly through the Home Office Science and Technology Programme, to improve understanding through research projects with academia and industry.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/13" class="indent">The GDS will focus on developing a successful GDS team by developing (by July 2005) and implementing (by December 2005) a succession and recruitment plan that values diversity and talent, and by setting a clear training plan and starting the process of becoming accredited to the Investors in People standard by the end of March 2006. By the end of March 2006 the GDS will have established a baseline for staff satisfaction so that it can address areas where improvement is necessary in future years.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/14" class="indent">The GDS will engage with its potential customers to deliver a new user-friendly and effective GDS. The GDS will carry out a customer satisfaction exercise to establish a baseline against which to set standards and objectives for the future. The GDS will endeavour to meet (within the constraints of the resources available) the needs of stakeholders for advice and guidance. To do this the GDS will draw up a communications plan, incorporating a strategy for stakeholder engagement, and secured the approval of the Ownership Board, by the end of November 2005. The plan will include the GDS's strategic objectives in communications, the resources it will commit to the task, and the range of opportunities that it will seek to make use of to deliver the plan.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/15" class="indent">By the end of October 2005, the GDS will have established an Audit and Risk Committee (as set out in the Framework Document), established its terms of reference, and completed a comprehensive review of risks to the Service's core business and an action plan to address them.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/16" class="indent">The GDS will work towards improving its efficiency by modelling, with the relevant specialist suppliers, the costs of two decontamination scenarios, so that it can set a baseline and show efficiency gains in future years. The GDS will also establish a baseline for the GDS's running costs and meet the Defra year on year 2.5 per cent. efficiency savings objective.</p>
	<p pid=".139WS.2/17" class="indent">The GDS will balance the GDS's books for the financial year 2005&ndash;06 within Government guidelines.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-21.144WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="144WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050721/wmstext/50721m08.htm#50721m08.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".144WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July 2005</phrase>, suspicions were raised about the possibility of Newcastle Disease being present in pheasants on an estate in Surrey. We acted immediately on suspicion of disease following the control measures set out in Defra's exotic animal disease generic contingency plan. The suspect premises were immediately placed under restriction while the state veterinary service started their investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/2">Initial investigations identified two possible sources of the infection. Among the 12,000 pheasants on the suspect premises were a number of birds imported from France during the previous month and so it was possible that they had first become infected there. The second possibility was that the pheasants had been infected once they had arrived in England from contact with wild birds. It is known that wild birds can carry the virus responsible for Newcastle Disease.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/3">The UK contacted the French authorities who immediately began a thorough investigation. There has been excellent co-operation between authorities in the two countries. There was a rapid exchange of information concerning the movement of birds between France and the infected premise in England. The French authorities identified a number of farms that had supplied birds to the infected farm. They undertook active surveillance and sampling which has now allowed them to conclude by blood sampling that birds on one farm have been exposed to the Newcastle Disease virus in the Loire Atlantique. Although virus isolation results are not yet available, culling of 20,000 pheasants and 35,000 partridges will commence on that farm today, ahead of final confirmation. The farm has been placed under restrictions and all movements off have been stopped.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/4">Disease on the premises in Surrey was confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-15">15 July</phrase> and an order was given for the pheasants on the infected premises to be killed. The first birds on the infected premise were humanely culled on Monday morning and by 5 pm on Monday, 2,700 birds had been killed. Depopulation is continuing and we will ensure that as many of the birds as possible are killed. The culled birds are incinerated in a commercial animal incinerator. None of the affected birds will enter the human food chain.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/5">Also on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-15">15 July</phrase>, a Declaratory Order was signed, putting in place a Protection Zone around the Infected Premise and a Surveillance Zone. A census of all poultry premises has been undertaken and patrol visits started in the Protection and Surveillance Zone. Samples have been taken from premises adjacent to the Infected Premise which could be epidemiologically linked. Clinical examinations of the larger poultry premises have started in the Surveillance Zone with no clinical evidence of Newcastle Disease being apparent.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/6">The EU Commission were informed immediately disease was confirmed and we continue to keep in close touch about the control measures we have put in place. The EU Commission is satisfied with the measures we have taken so far.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/7">We immediately put in place measures to ensure exports, both to EU member states and non EU countries of birds and hatching eggs do not originate from within the Infected Area. Intra-Community trade in birds and hatching eggs takes place on the basis of EU export health certificates which give area freedom from Newcastle Disease. Trade in birds and other susceptible commodities which originate from outside the restricted area can continue. Export health certificates to non EU destinations are required for most commodities relating to birds, including hatching eggs, poultrymeat, poultry products, table eggs, ready meals etc. The conditions for export depends on that country's import requirements. Exports to non-EU countries can take place provided the importing country has not imposed a total ban on imports of poultry and poultry meat or requires the UK to be free of the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/8">Our advice to poultry keepers is to put in place strong biosecurity arrangements, keep an eye open for disease and to consider, in consultation with their veterinarians, whether vaccination would be appropriate. Some large-scale poultry producers already routinely vaccinate their flocks against Newcastle Disease. The Secretary of State may order vaccination of poultry if she thinks it is an appropriate and proportionate response to the disease outbreak.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/9">The Health Protection Agency has confirmed that Newcastle Disease virus does not pose a significant threat to human health even when people handle birds known to be infected. Close contact is required for transmission to man. The virus is spread via aerosols from infected birds which can occasionally cause conjunctivitis, fever and flu like symptoms. The symptoms only last a few days and there are no long term effects on health. There is no risk of human infection from consuming poultry meat.</p>
	<p pid=".144WS.1/10">Industry and other stakeholders, including game shooting bodies, have been kept informed of the suspicion and confirmation of disease and their views have been sought. Industry supports the action taken as they wish the outbreak to be eradicated as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".145WS.1/1">I chaired the Council for the agriculture items on the agenda. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary (Commons), Ben Bradshaw, represented the United Kingdom and chaired the Council for the fisheries item. Also in attendance was the Parliamentary Under Secretary (Commons), Jim Knight.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/2">Before the Council I met a delegation from the EU federation of farm unions and farm co-operatives (COPA-COGECA) including representatives of the sugar beet growers organisation (CIBE).</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/3">I began the Council by presenting the UK presidency work programme for the next six months. It includes amongst other things, sugar reform, the EU's Rural Development Strategic Guidelines, Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), Avian Influenza, Welfare of Broiler Chickens and a range of proposals to progress the sustainability of the fisheries industry.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/4">The Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection took the opportunity to announce adoption of a TSE Roadmap setting out the Community's BSE Strategy for the short, medium and long term, and signalled his intention to publish an Action Plan on Animal Welfare towards the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/5">He also presented a proposed directive establishing minimum rules for the welfare of chickens kept for meat production. I said the presidency would take forward technical discussions on the proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/6">At the request of France, Council discussed the measures introduced by the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July</phrase> to protect the Bay of Biscay anchovy stock. The Commission was not prepared to relax its ban on fishing at this stage but said it would keep the situation under constant review.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/7">The Agriculture Commissioner presented her proposal for EU Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development, hoping for political agreement on this proposal in October. The guidelines aimed to ensure that rural development programmes contributed to the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives of jobs, growth and sustainability. Once the EU Guidelines had been agreed, they would be the basis for drawing up national strategies through a process of dialogue between Member States and the Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/8">Over lunch the Agriculture Commissioner provided the Council with an update from last week's WTO mini-ministerial meeting under the Doha Development Agenda negotiations. There had been no major developments but she noted that its existing mandate had allowed the Commission to engage constructively in the discussion and to maintain pressure on other trading partners.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/9">The Council held its first discussion on Commission proposals to reform the EU sugar regime. There was broad support for a restructuring scheme instead of production quota cuts, and for a 10-year time horizon, but some member states argued that the proposed price cuts went too far and too fast, that compensation should be higher, and that the &quot;Everything But Arms&quot; import arrangements should be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/10">Under Any Other Business, Italy called for the Commission to open crisis distillation measures before the end of July to deal with the critical situation on its wine market. The Commission replied that they needed time to analyse the situation, but would do so as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/11">The Netherlands expressed concern about the clarity of Community marketing standards for poultry meat. In particular, they were concerned that poultry meat that had been frozen should not be labelled as fresh. They also called for the introduction of a label for poultry meat originating from EU. The Commission agreed that marketing defrosted poultry meat as fresh was not in conformity with EU standards. The Commission would reflect thoroughly on both questions.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/12">In light of an intervention by the Danish Minister, a proposal for a Council Decision providing for derogations from the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances Regulation for lead and for the flame retardant, Deca BDE, in electrical and electronic equipment, which had come forward for formal adoption from the Environment Council, was referred back to the Committee of Permanent Representatives for further discussion.</p>
	<p pid=".145WS.1/13">In closing the Council I noted that the informal Agriculture Council would be a joint event with the Environment Council taking place in London from 10&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-09-12">12 September</phrase>. The next Agriculture and Fisheries Council would be on 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-20">20 September</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".147WS.4/1">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) was held on 18 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July</phrase> in Brussels. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase> chaired the Council, given our presidency. I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/2">The Foreign Secretary made a short intervention at the start of the GAERC on the London bombings. He thanked partners for their expressions of sympathy and recalled the declaration agreed by the JHA Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July</phrase>. The Council adopted short conclusions reaffirming the declaration, focusing on external action.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/3">The agenda items were covered as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/4" class="italic">Presidency Work Programme</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/5">The Foreign Secretary gave a brief presentation on the GAERC work programme for the next six months, highlighting in particular future financing and the future of Europe. On future financing, the Foreign Secretary highlighted the presidency's commitment to work towards a deal during the presidency. On the future of Europe, the Foreign Secretary welcomed Luxembourg's referendum result, and said that the next step should be on the basis of the declaration agreed at the June 2005 European Council. We are committed to having a broad, inclusive debate during the period of reflection. The informal Heads of Government meeting this autumn was a key next step.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/6" class="italic">Enlargement</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/7">The Foreign Secretary briefed partners on the <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July</phrase> meeting of the Croatia task force, where there was further consideration of Croatian co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). There was no change in its assessment that Croatia was not yet co-operating fully with the tribunal. The Foreign Secretary invited the task force to review the situation in September.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/8">Commissioner Rehn presented the Commission's draft negotiating mandate for Turkey. He highlighted that Turkey's progress would be long and difficult. The Council's reasons for opening talks and its previous commitments remained unchanged. The opening of negotiations on <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase> was conditional on six pieces of legislation entering into force&mdash;they all had on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">1 June</phrase>&mdash;and on Turkey signing the Ankara agreement protocol. The Foreign Secretary confirmed that the presidency would be working towards the signing of the protocol in consultation with the Council legal service.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/9" class="italic">World Trade Organisation (WTO)</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/10">Commissioner Mandelson updated the Council on the mini-ministerial in Dalian (12 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July</phrase>) and gave an assessment of how preparations are going in the run-up to the end-July WTO general council in Geneva. The Foreign Secretary noted that the main trade discussion would take place during the informal trade ministers' dinner on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July</phrase>. The Council agreed conclusions, which recalled that Council conclusions from October 1999 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-28">28 June 2003</phrase>, in particular, remain valid and set the Community approach to the Doha development agenda (DDA) negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/11" class="italic">Preparation of the EU-China Summit</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/12">The Foreign Secretary updated partners on the progress of preparation for the <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-05">5 September</phrase> summit. A progress report on summit preparations covering the draft agenda, elements for a joint statement and declaration on climate change and energy was agreed. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner highlighted that the Commission would also be signing the financing agreement for two environmental projects totalling &euro;55 million. The Commission also raised China market economy status (MES), noting that they would keep this under active review and wanted to see some progress at the summit. The Foreign Secretary concluded that the Commission and presidency would take forward summit negotiations with the Chinese and keep partners fully informed.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/13" class="italic">Uzbekistan</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/14">The Foreign Secretary highlighted the importance of the EU's response to the situation in Uzbekistan. The EU would not solve the problem in one stroke, and should bear in mind its long-term policy towards Uzbekistan and the region as a whole. The Council welcomed the appointment of Jan Kubis as EU special representative for central Asia and noted his intention to travel to the region as soon as possible. The Council agreed to review the EU-Uzbekistan partnership and co-operation agreement in the light of his visit. The Council agreed conclusions expressing profound concern about the situation in Uzbekistan. The presidency will continue to monitor the situation during August.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/15" class="italic">Zimbabwe</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/16">High Representative Solana gave an account of the unacceptable situation in Zimbabwe and stressed the need to work with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and other African partners. He also welcomed the UN's forthcoming assessment and the African Union's decision to send an envoy to Zimbabwe. Commissioner Michel also condemned the recent actions and noted that the EU position was clearly stated in the declaration on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase> and the demarches in SADC capitals. The Foreign Secretary concluded that if the UN special envoy's report was critical, the Council should consider further restrictive measures. The Council agreed conclusions condemning Operation Murambatsvina; expressing profound concern about the demolitions and evictions; and agreeing to keep EU policy, including on sanctions, under review.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/17" class="italic">UN Millennium Review Summit</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/18">Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner outlined the key elements of the Commission's communication on UN reform to the Council.

	<p pid=".147WS.4/20">Terje Roed-Larsen, the UN Secretary-General's special envoy on the implementation of UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1559 briefed Ministers over lunch. Larsen highlighted that the withdrawal of Syrian military forces was now complete. Larsen informed the Council that the recent Lebanese elections, which had been broadly free and fair, had been an important step towards creating an independent and sovereign Lebanon. The EU should now encourage the Lebanese to form a new Government quickly and play a role in tackling corruption and strengthening good governance and security. The Foreign Secretary summed up and expressed strong support for Larsen's work. Council conclusions were agreed, which call on Syria to take action to promote stability in Iraq, Lebanon and on the middle east peace process.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/21" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/22">High Representative Solana briefed the Council on his recent (10 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July</phrase>) visit to the region. He commented that the situation on the ground was now calm, but developments at the end of last week and over the weekend had not been positive. The Council discussed Gaza disengagement and reiterated its full support for Quartet Special Envoy James Wolfensohn. Ministers emphasised the urgent need for Israel and the Palestinian Authority to co-operate effectively with each other and with Mr. Wolfensohn to support Palestinian institutional and economic development. The Council urged the Palestinian Authority to accelerate reforms and Israel to put in place the conditions essential to viable Palestinian economic growth. The Council noted the ongoing role played by the Commission in leading donor activity on Palestinian governance issues. Conclusions were agreed which reflected these points.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/23" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/24">The Foreign Secretary, together with the French and German Ministers and High Representative Solana, briefed partners on the work towards a comprehensive package on the three issues covered by the <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-15">15 November 2004</phrase> Paris agreement: nuclear issues; political and security issues; and economic and technological co-operation. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner briefed on the outcome of the 12 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July</phrase> negotiations on the EU-Iran trade and co-operation agreement. Ministers also discussed the outcome of the recent Iranian presidential elections.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/25" class="italic">Indonesia/Aceh</p>

It welcomed the successful conclusion of the Helsinki negotiations and agreed that the EU should be prepared, in principle, to provide observers to monitor the implementation of the peace agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/27" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Estonia/Russia Border Treaty</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/28">Estonian Foreign Minister Paet outlined to partners why the ratification of this treaty has stalled and how they hope to take matters forward with the Russian Federation. The presidency said this was a matter of acute concern for the Estonian people. We hoped for a satisfactory outcome of the ratification process, based on what had already been agreed between Estonia and Russia, as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/29" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Malta/Illegal Immigration</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/30">The Council heard an intervention from Maltese Foreign Minister Frendo on the increasingly acute problem of illegal immigration in Malta and noted his request for solidarity and for this issue to be kept on the Council's agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/31" class="italic">EU-Macedonia Association Council</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/32">In the margins of the GAERC, the annual EU-Macedonia Stabilisation and Association Council meeting took place on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July</phrase>. Macedonian Foreign Minister Mitreva chaired. I led the EU, supported by Commission Rehn, the Council secretariat and the Austrian Minister for Europe, Dr. Winkler. Mitreva was accompanied by experts on the Ohrid framework agreement, policing, judiciary, minorities and the economy, who made technical presentations in these areas. Mitreva expressed disappointment at the EU's cautious stance on visa liberalisation. The Association Council underlined the June 2005 European Council's commitment, which emphasised that the future of the western Balkans lay within the EU, provided each country met the established conditions. The Association Council welcomed Macedonia's adoption of the final legislation linked to the framework agreement and looked forward to its full implementation. The Association Council also stressed the need for further reform of the police and judiciary, fighting corruption, structural economic reform and meeting the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) criticisms of this year's municipal elections.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/33" class="italic">EU-Kazakhstan Cooperation Council</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/34">In the margins of the GAERC, the EU and the Republic of Kazakhstan held its seventh meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July 2005</phrase>. I chaired the meeting and was supported by the Austrian Minister for Europe, Dr. Winkler, and the Commissioner for Energy, Mr. Andris Piebalgs. Kazakhstan was led by Deputy Prime Minister Akhmetzhan Smagulovich Yessimov.</p>
	<p pid=".147WS.4/35">The Co-operation Council reaffirmed the desire to see EU-Kazakhstan relations continue to strengthen politically, economically and commercially, especially in the context of the partnership and co-operation agreement. It emphasised the need for increased efforts by the Kazakh authorities to comply fully with international norms and standards, including those of OSCE, in the fields of rule of law, democracy and human rights. The Co-operation Council expressed its expectation that the forthcoming presidential elections would be fair and in line with international standards. The Co-operation Council also agreed to promote bilateral dialogue focusing on market access issues and to work for early accession of Kazakhstan to the WTO. It welcomed the signature of the agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Kazakhstan on trade in certain steel products. The Co-operation Council underlined the importance of regional co-operation in central Asia as an effective means of conflict prevention and economic development in the region and welcomed the increasingly active role Kazakhstan is playing in different regional initiatives.</p>

	<p pid=".166WS.1/4">Also published today are the RDAs' reported tier 3 outputs for 2004&ndash;05. These results are evidence that the RDAs continue to play a valuable role in improving the economic performance of the English regions and, through working with their partners, the RDAs are making a real difference to the individual regional economies concerned. The figures cover the creation and safeguarding of jobs, the amount of brownfield land brought back into use, the number of businesses added to the regional economies, the number of learning opportunities created and the amount of private sector investment attracted benefiting deprived areas, all as a result of RDA activity.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.1/5">Press releases on the tier 3 outputs have been issued in each region. Copies of the output results have been placed in the Library, and are also available on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/rda/info">www.dti.gov.uk/rda/info</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".166WS.3/1">The Informal Competitiveness Council hosted by the UK presidency took place in Cardiff on 11 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July 2005</phrase>. Lord Sainsbury of Turville chaired the first day, covering research issues, and I chaired the second day, which considered EU better regulation and the development of the internal market. Over dinner on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July</phrase>, both Research and Economics/Industry Ministers discussed innovation policy.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/2">On the first day, Research Ministers heard presentations from a number of speakers, including Research Commissioner Potocnik and representatives from industry and science.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/3">The Commission stressed the need for the EU to help fulfil Lisbon goals for growth and jobs by committing more money for EU research, both nationally and for the EU's next research framework programme (FP7). Speakers from academia and business gave presentations on how the framework programme could be made simpler and more accessible for business and how the Scientific Council for the proposed European Research Council (ERC) had been chosen.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/4">Ministers then broke up into five small groups for detailed discussions on the structure of the European Research Council (ERC); increasing industry and SME participation in the framework programme; and how to develop the potential of the less research intensive regions. In addition, Ministers were asked to consider the cross-cutting issue of simplification as it related to their areas.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/5">Group rapporteurs reported vigorous and useful discussions. Lord Sainsbury concluded that, while there were still difficult issues to tackle, there was consensus on the need for the ERC to be independent; on the need for effective, practical help for SMEs; that collaborative research should be more user-driven; that help for less research intensive regions had to be focussed; and on the continued importance and need for simplification.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/6">On the second day, the session on EU better regulation opened with presentations from Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry Gunter Verheugen, Alain Perroy, the director general of CEFIC (the European Confederation for the Chemicals Industry) and leading member of the Alliance for a Competitive European Industry, and Jacek Piechota, the Polish Economics Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/7">The Commission's commitment to progressing the better regulation agenda in the EU and the importance of regulatory reform in achieving Lisbon objectives on growth and jobs were stressed. The Commission also outlined recent initiatives that would contribute to the delivery of regulatory reform, including strengthened impact assessment guidelines that would ensure that the effects of proposed legislation on competitiveness were taken into account. A new push to simplify existing EU regulation and screening of proposals that were already on the table for their effects on competitiveness. Alain Perroy gave a business perspective on the need for regulatory reform and Jacek Piechota outlined steps that Poland had taken at a national level to improve policy-making processes.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/8">Ministers then split into four groups to discuss using impact assessments in Council deliberations; maximising the involvement of business in policy-making; simplification; and what member states can do to improve the regulatory framework at a national level. Ministers reported productive and positive discussions, with a strong consensus on the need to deliver regulatory reform for growth and jobs. In my summary, I welcomed the Commission's clear commitment to change and recent initiatives, and emphasised the need for the Commission and member states to work together to achieve results.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/9">Debate on the internal market began with presentations from Czech Deputy Prime Minister for economic affairs Martin Jahn, who explained how membership of the internal market has benefited the Czech economy, and Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, who called for greater efforts to ensure effective implementation of the existing acquis and for progress on opening up the market in services.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/10">Subsequent breakout group discussions concluded that the internal market was often taken for granted and should be more vigorously promoted. The perception of enlargement (focused on immigration and social dumping) was at odds with the actual impact (a strengthened global position for the EU, a more varied and flexible EU economy). Ministers also emphasised the need for progress on the services directive as key to the future development of the internal market. In addition, implementation, enforcement and the provision of advice and assistance to businesses and citizens were seen as crucial.</p>
	<p pid=".166WS.3/11">The presidency summary of debate has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and can also be found at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ewt/compet.htm">www.dti.gov.uk/ewt/compet.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".168WS.1/1">Following news reports in recent weeks, I made a statement about the coal health compensation schemes to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>, outlining a number of immediate steps I was taking to respond to these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".168WS.1/2">I now wish to inform the House that the Secretary of State and I have also decided to initiate an external review of the Department's administration of the former British Coal health schemes so that the Government can be advised whether any further action is necessary in the way in which we are internally managing the schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".168WS.1/3">The draft terms of reference are:</p>
	<p pid=".168WS.1/4" class="indent">&quot;To review the integrity of the administration of the scheme for dealing with coal health claims; and to identify any specific measures needed to improve the administration of the scheme; to consider whether there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent, detect and pursue fraud whilst ensuring the fair and timely settlement of claims; and to make recommendations accordingly to Ministers and/or the Accounting Officer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".168WS.1/5">Candidates to lead the review are currently being approached and we hope that the lead of the review will be announced shortly. The precise timing and conduct of the review would be a matter for further discussion with the head of the review, but we would expect that conclusions should be available by the end of September.</p>
	<p pid=".168WS.1/6">The review will not encroach on the ongoing investigations being carried out by the South Yorkshire police into potential fraud under the compensation schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".169WS.2/13">The 2005 Act also covers general qualifications bodies awarding general qualifications, such as A-levels and GCSEs. This new duty was introduced following a recommendation made by the pre-legislative Scrutiny Committee in May 2004. During passage of the Bill, we made clear that we would need to consult with all interested parties before finalising the detail of the duty. That consultation is ongoing and we will announce the commencement date of the duty later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".169WS.2/14">I am also placing in the Library the outcome of the consultation exercise the Department completed earlier this year on our proposals for using regulation making powers under the 2005 Act's provisions on private clubs, premises, the definition of disability and the Part 3 Questions Procedure. In general, respondents agreed with our proposed approach and we will be bringing forward draft Regulations accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".169WS.2/15">However, in the light of consultation, and following a review of evidence of the extent of discrimination faced by people with more minor forms of cancer, we have decided not to exercise the 2005 Act's regulation-making power which would allow us to exclude certain types of cancer from automatic coverage by the DDA 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".169WS.2/16">We have concluded that it is not possible to distinguish effectively between those people whose cancers are likely to go on to require substantial treatment and those whose cancers are not and that, if we were to attempt to do so, we would introduce uncertainty and complexity into the definition of disability. This would lead to unfair and unequal outcomes for disabled people, and make it difficult for employers and others with responsibilities under the Act to understand and comply with their duties. Treating all people who have cancer as disabled people ensures a straightforward approach, which will provide equity of outcome, while having minimal consequences for employers and service providers by reducing red tape.</p>
	<p pid=".169WS.2/17">Finally, our 2004 consultation document, &quot;Delivering equality for disabled people&quot; (CM 6255) covered the bodies that would be subject to 'specific duties' to assist them in complying with the new general public sector duty to promote equality for disabled people. As a result of that consultation, we have decided that the following additional bodies will be subject to the specific duties:</p>
