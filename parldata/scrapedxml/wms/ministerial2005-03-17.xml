	<p>I am publishing today the Department's five-year plan, &quot;Living Life to the Full&quot;. Copies will be deposited in the House Libraries and the plan will be available on the DCMS website.</p>
	<p>The plan sets our course for the next five years and builds on the significant progress that we have made in recent years. It sets out our achievements, our goals and the practical steps we will take to achieve them in the years ahead.</p>
	<p>The fabric of this country and the quality of life we all experience are improving rapidly. The average proportion of household income spent on leisure nearly doubled between 1977 and 2002. We all expect more choice and higher quality. At the same time, opportunities are expanding to enjoy the arts, visit museums and galleries, to play sport, to travel, access the world's best media and prosper in the creative industries.</p>
	<p>We have come a long way. In 2001 we introduced free admission to national museums and galleries&mdash;resulting in a record number of visits&mdash;34 million last year. Creative partnerships&mdash;bringing the experience and stimulation of culture to young people in deprived areas&mdash;will see 450,000 young people involved by this time next year. We recently published the BBC Green Paper setting out the framework for a strong BBC independent of Government. We are investing &pound;1 billion in sports facilities to benefit every community. Working in partnership with the Department for Education and Skills we have ensured that more than a half of all children in school do a weekly minimum of two hours PE and school sport, up from a quarter in 2002. We are putting our whole-hearted support behind London's bid to bring the Olympics to this country in 2012.</p>
	<p>But there are still too many people who do not know about the opportunities available to them or who are not able to afford the cost of their talent. There are parents who cannot afford to support their children in making the most of their creativity and skills; adults who do not know how to get involved in local cultural and sporting opportunities; young people who miss out on formative experiences.</p>
	<p>In the plan we make 10 commitments covering the key areas where the Department, working together with our partners in our sponsored bodies, in local government, in the voluntary and private sectors, can make a real difference.</p>
	<p>We will work to build a comprehensive offer to young people on culture&mdash;known as creative sparks. We will review how national Lottery money has been spent so far on arts, sport, heritage and film projects, and then consult about how proceeds should be spent in these areas after 2009. We will continue to improve our support for elite athletes, rewarding success with the talented athlete and 2012 scholarships. We will persuade nearly half a million adults per year to become physically active. We will complete our programme to replace outdated licensing and gambling laws, balancing personal freedom and prosperity with strengthening protection for the vulnerable. We will provide a virtual high-street for tourism and leisure offering an information and booking service to on-line users.</p>
	<p>The title of the plan is &quot;Living Life to the Full&quot;. Quite simply that is what our sectors can offer&mdash;the ability for everyone to live their lives and develop their talents to the fullest extent. So the aim of our five-year plan is straightforward, yet ambitious&mdash;making the quality of life in this country world-class and giving everyone the chance to taste it.</p>

	Revised Spatial Strategy (East Midlands) and Milton Keynes and South Midlands Sub-regional Strategy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-03-17.22WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" speakername="Keith Hill" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning" colnum="22WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050317/wmstext/50317m01.htm#50317m01.html_spmin2">
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is today publishing the revised regional spatial strategy for the east midlands (RSS8) and the Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-regional strategy (MKSM SRS). This follows public examinations on the draft revised RPG8 and the MKSM SRS and subsequent public consultations on proposed changes to both documents.</p>
	<p>Copies of the revised RSS and MKSM SRS, together with the related statements of changes and summary of representations, are available in both Libraries of the House. These have also been provided for all the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities. Documents are also available via the ODPM and regional government office web-sites: <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a>; <a href="http://www.gose.gov.uk">www.gose.gov.uk</a>; <a href="http://www.go-em.gov.uk">www.go-em.gov.uk</a>; <a href="http://www.go-east.gov.uk">www.go-east.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p class="italic">Regional spatial strategy for the east midlands (RSS8)</p>
	<p>RPG8 was issued by the Secretary of State in January 2002 to provide a broad development strategy for the east midlands up to 2021. This also represented the &quot;spatial&quot; element of the east midlands Integrated regional strategy (IRS) and provided the framework for meeting the region's development needs in a way that promotes a more sustainable pattern of development.</p>
	<p>The revised RSS, issued today, is more concise, more regionally specific, more focused on delivery and has cross references to national policy rather than repetition. However the RSS also incorporates relevant parts of the MKSM SRS, including increased housing figures for Northamptonshire. Elsewhere in the region housing provision figures were not reviewed but these will be re-examined in the next RSS review which will be conducted under the spatial planning principles required by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act.</p>
	<p>Other new elements in the revised RSS include:</p>
	<p class="indent">A revised regional transport strategy, which has been informed by a number of major studies in the region, and revised indicative targets and timescales for transport schemes;</p>
	<p class="indent">A criteria-based policy for renewable energy projects;</p>
	<p class="indent">A new map of natural and cultural assets;</p>
	<p class="indent">Proposals for sub-regional strategies in parts of the region, including the area around Nottingham, Derby and Leicester (the &quot;three cities&quot;), the northern coalfield area of north Nottinghamshire and north Derbyshire and an area around Lincoln (the Lincoln policy area); and</p>
	<p class="indent">A new appendix which indicates how policies are to be implemented and measured.</p>
	<p class="italic">Milton Keynes &amp; South Midlands Sub-Regional Strategy</p>
	<p>This relates to one of the four growth areas set out in the Government's sustainable communities plan published in February 2003, and covers Northamptonshire and parts of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Its largest urban centres are Milton Keynes, Northampton, Luton-Dunstable-Houghton Regis and Bedford-Kempston.</p>
	<p>One of the key objectives of the plan is to increase housing supply and particularly to facilitate the building of more affordable houses in the area. The final sub-regional strategy, being published today, sets out the scale and form of development up to 2021 and will provide strategic direction for local authorities, local delivery vehicles and other delivery bodies.</p>
	<p>The strategy incorporates amendments following public consultation on the Secretary of State's proposed changes to the draft strategy prepared by the regional assemblies for the east of England, the east midlands and the south-east. The strategy has also taken account of the recommendations of the independent panel following the five week public examination held in March and April 2004.</p>
	<p>Key issues that emerged from the public consultation include:</p>
	<p class="indent">The importance of infrastructure provision to enable growth;</p>
	<p class="indent">The need for economic growth as well as housing growth;</p>
	<p class="indent">Clarification of the status of some key transport projects;</p>
	<p class="indent">Community safety&mdash;the need to create neighbourhoods designed to minimise crime and antisocial behaviour;</p>
	<p class="indent">The applicability of affordable housing targets for Milton Keynes and Aylesbury;</p>
	<p class="indent">The need to place greater emphasis on regeneration in Luton and issues of green belt review around the town;</p>
	<p class="indent">The reintroduction of possible directions of growth around Northampton.</p>
	<p>The Secretary of State has carefully considered these issues along with all representations submitted, and has made a number of amendments to the final document in response.</p>
	<p>The sub-regional strategy constitutes revisions to the regional spatial strategies for the south-east, east of England, and east midlands and will therefore form part of the statutory policy basis for the preparation of local development documents by local planning authorities within the sub-region. It is at this stage that detailed site specific proposals will be brought forward and this process will provide further opportunities for public consultation and stakeholder involvement.</p>
	<p>Increasing the supply of homes and affordable housing in the wider south-east is essential to promote sustainable communities, and it is critical that the scale of growth is itself sustainable. This means that new communities must have the infrastructure that they need such as schools, transport and health facilities. The sub-regional strategy will help ensure that brownfield land is used first, improve the environmental efficiency of homes, and create new green spaces and places that will stand the test of time.</p>

	<p>On 27 January I announced that the chief medical officer for England had agreed to carry out a review of the revalidation of doctors and related matters, following concerns expressed by Dame Janet Smith in her fifth report from the Shipman inquiry. Dame Janet focused her inquiries, as her remit required, on the medical profession. However if changes are proposed to the arrangements for doctors, it is likely that they will have important implications for the regulatory arrangements for the other health professions, particularly where their roles are changing. And there may be other implications. I have therefore asked Mr. Andrew Foster, director of workforce, to lead a review of non-medical professional regulation. This review will run in parallel to the review into medical issues being conducted by Sir Liam Donaldson. It will consider and advise me about the measures needed to:</p>
	<p class="indent">strengthen procedures for ensuring that the performance or conduct of non-medical health professionals and other health care staff does not pose a threat to patient safety or the effective functioning of services, particularly focusing on the effective and fair operation of fitness to practise procedures;</p>
	<p class="indent">ensure the operation of effective systems of continuing professional development and appraisal for non-medical health care staff and make progress towards regular revalidation where this is appropriate;</p>
	<p class="indent">ensure the effective regulation of health care staff working in new roles within the healthcare sector and of other staff in regular contact with patients.</p>
	<p>In the light of the above, it will further consider and recommend any changes needed to the role, structure, functions and number of regulators of non-medical healthcare professional staff. The director of workforce is likely to report his conclusions and recommendations to me towards the end of the year.</p>
	<p>As with CMO's Review, there will be an advisory group, which will include experts from non-medical regulators and from the NHS. A larger reference group, which will include education and training bodies and professional organisations as well as consumer and healthcare quality interests, will also support this process.</p>
	<p>The members of the advisory group are:</p>

	<p>The 26 December 2004 tsunami brought destruction to coastal areas of South and South-East Asian countries and claimed over 273,000 lives, leaving millions of people in need of assistance.</p>
	<p>DFID committed &pound;75 million to the immediate relief effort, some &pound;66 million of which has already been allocated to United Nations agencies, the Red Cross movement, and non-government organisations, or spent through DFID direct action or donations in kind.</p>
	<p>The British public has responded with unprecedented generosity to this disaster. Appeals such as that of the Disasters Emergency Committee have had an overwhelming response.</p>
	<p>DFID will now contribute up to &pound;65 million for longer-term rehabilitation and reconstruction. This is likely to be channelled mainly through the trust funds that are being set up in affected countries. Our response will be guided by the findings of needs assessments currently being finalised, and by the level of resources already available to affected countries. Our assistance towards longer-term reconstruction will not be at the expense of DFID funding for other emergencies or existing programmes.</p>

	<p>Earlier today, I informed the Government of Nepal that the Department for International Development was ending support to Nepal's police, prison services and the Prime Minister's office. A total of &pound;2.4 million had been committed but &pound;1.3 million remains unspent and will now be cancelled.</p>
	<p>This follows the dismissal of the Government by King Gyanendra of Nepal on 1 February. Since then, the UK Government have been carrying out an initial assessment of the implications for our development partnership with Nepal. Assistance will continue to be kept under review.</p>
	<p>The criteria against which decisions on DFID assistance are made are the ability to make an effective contribution towards the millennium development goals and the safety and security of staff. We need to ensure that our programmes can continue to benefit poor and excluded people in Nepal. It is vital that the Government of Nepal maintain agreed financial allocations to essential development services, such as health and education, and not divert them to other purposes.</p>
	<p>Along with the rest of the international donor community, the safety and welfare of staff carrying out development programmes, especially those in the field, is of paramount importance. We will not continue programmes in the face of increased and unacceptable risk or interference. The UK has called on both parties to the violent conflict in Nepal to ensure that the international community can continue to provide the development assistance that is needed to provide essential services to the poor. The Department for International Development will press for concrete measures by both sides to affirm that they will do everything in their power to safeguard poverty reduction programmes and staff.</p>
	<p>We are deeply concerned about human rights in Nepal and will continue to work with others in the international community to encourage democracy in Nepal, the full protection of human rights by both parties to the conflict and progress towards a peace process.</p>

	<p>I am pleased to announce that we are today publishing a White Paper setting out proposals for a Company Law Reform Bill.</p>
	<p>These proposals result from a comprehensive review of company law, which we initiated in 1998. In 2001 we received the final report from the company law review, an independent group of experts, practitioners and business people. The White Paper also takes account of international and other developments. We are very grateful for the input of a wide range of interested parties into the proposals we are bringing forward today.</p>
	<p>The White Paper sets out a range of measures designed to further four crucial objectives: to enhance shareholder engagement and a long term investment culture; to ensure better regulation and a &quot;Think Small First&quot; approach; to make it easier to set up and run a company; and to provide flexibility for the future.</p>
	<p>The proposals are part of a wider programme of action to facilitate enterprise, encourage investment and promote long-term company performance. We brought forward legislation to strengthen regulation of the accounting and audit profession and to allow a new type of community enterprise company. We have laid draft regulations for quoted companies to produce an operating and financial review and we have introduced greater transparency by quoted companies on directors' remuneration. We have taken smaller companies out of the need for an audit. We have also worked with market participants to strengthen corporate governance and shareholder engagement.</p>
	<p>The measures set out in the White Paper represent a significant step forward in ensuring that our law remains up to date, flexible, and accessible for all those who use it. By making company law better fitted to today's realities, the measures should create improved performance across the economy as whole. They could also produce cost savings for business of some &pound;250 million a year. The proposals will help ensure that Britain remains one of the best places in the world to set up and run a business.</p>
