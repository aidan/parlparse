	<p pid="a.7WS.5/1">Lord Hunt, Minister for Sustainable Development and Energy Innovation and I, will represent the UK at the Environment Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-04">4 December</phrase>. Stewart Stevenson, Scottish Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change will also attend.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.5/2">At Environment Council the French presidency will report on progress on the EU climate-energy legislative package. They will also provide briefing on the proposed renewable energy directive. The main outstanding issues on the climate and energy package include the redistribution of a proportion of allowances to the new member states for the purposes of solidarity; how to identify those sectors at risk of carbon leakage and what measures would be appropriate to reduce this risk; and the use of revenues from the auctioning of allowances. The door is still open for agreement on a financing mechanism for the demonstration of carbon capture and storage technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.5/3">The presidency will also report on progress on the proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars&mdash;C02 from cars&mdash;and on the proposal for a directive on industrial emissions&mdash;integrated pollution prevention and control, IPPC directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.5/4">Furthermore, there will be a policy debate and adoption of Council conclusions on the sustainable consumption and production (SCP) and sustainable industrial policy (SIP) action plan. The policy debate is likely to focus on next steps for delivering the plan, ecolabelling, lifestyles and behaviour, and carbon content display for products.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.5/5">Following policy debates, Ministers are due to adopt Council conclusions on addressing the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and addressing the global mercury challenges in preparation for the 25th session of the UNEP Governing Council in Nairobi on 16 to <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-20">20 February 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.5/6">Under 'any other business', the European Commission will present communications on: the dismantling of ships; the EU strategy on invasive alien species, the EU and the Arctic region and the implementation of European Community environmental law. Additionally, the European Commission is likely to present a Green Paper on biowaste management in the European Union. Finally, the Irish delegation has asked for a discussion under 'any other business' on waste&mdash;the fall in demand for recycled materials.</p>

	<p pid="a.14WS.7/1">The legislative programme for the Fourth Session was unveiled in the Queen's Speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-03">3 December</phrase>. All of the Bills announced in the Queen's Speech contain provisions that apply to Scotland, this is a programme that will significantly benefit Scots from all walks of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/2">In this Session the Government will take forward measures to ensure fair rules, fair chances and fair futures for people across Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/3">This statement includes a summary of the legislation announced in the Queen's Speech and its application to Scotland. This statement includes both new Bills that will be introduced in the coming weeks and months and those Bills that are carrying-over from the last Session. It does not include draft Bills. The Bills listed in section 1 are not likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament. Section 2 details Bills that are likely to contain provisions that require the legislative consent of the Scottish Parliament (LCM) in line with the Sewel convention. A brief description is provided of the provisions likely to require consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/4">The list also identifies the lead Government Department:</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/5" class="italic">UK Legislation unlikely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament at introduction:</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/6">The Bills in this section deal largely with reserved matters. Discussions will continue between the Government and the Scottish Ministers to ensure that if provisions relating to matters which trigger the Sewel convention are included in any of these Bills during their passage at Westminster, the consent of the Scottish Parliament will be sought for them:</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/7">Banking (HMT) (introduced in 3rd Session)</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/8">Borders, Immigration and Citizenship (HO)</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/9">Child Poverty (Child Poverty Unit)</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/10">Health (DoH)<sup>(1)</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/11">Political Parties and Elections (MOJ) (introduced in 3rd Session)</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/12">Savings Gateway (HMT)</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/13" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup>While health care is predominately a devolved matter, the provisions in this Bill extending to Scotland do not require an LCM</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/14" class="italic">Legislation likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament at introduction:</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/15">Discussions will continue between the Government and the Scottish Ministers on Bills that might include provisions that trigger the Sewel convention. The Bills identified within the Queen's Speech in this section are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/16"><i>Children, Skills and Learning (DCFS)</i>&mdash;The Bill allows for arrangements between UK and Scottish Ministers to be made in relation to the provision of education and training services that will require an LCM. The Bill will also include reserved measures on the right to request time off to train.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/17"><i>Coroners and Justice (MOJ)</i>&mdash;The Bill will include devolved measures, that require an LCM, on criminal memoirs and the transposition of the services directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/18"><i>Equality Bill (GEO)</i>&mdash;Equal opportunities is a reserved matter. This Bill will require an LCM as it will amend the Scottish Ministers functions by allowing them to impose specific public sector duties on Scottish public bodies for the three new strands.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/19"><i>Local Democracy, Economic Regeneration and Construction (DCLG)</i>&mdash;The Bill requires an LCM for devolved measures that relate to the construction industry supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/20">Specifically these will improve clarity on cash flow and encourage parties to resolve disputes by adjudication rather than by litigation. Additionally the Bill will repeal uncommenced provisions in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act that apply to Scotland which relate to the Boundary Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/21"><i>Marine and Coastal Access (DEFRA)</i>&mdash;This Bill will greatly improve the way the UK uses its vast natural marine resources and maximises the benefits it gets from them, balancing competing, economic, ecological and social interests. The Bill will enable a single UK-wide marine policy statement to be drawn up by UK Ministers in conjunction with the devolved administrations. An LCM will be required to make Scottish Ministers the marine planning authority and to give them powers to designate marine conservation zones for the Scottish offshore region. They will also have responsibility for marine licensing in relation to many activities in the Scottish offshore region.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/22"><i>Policing and Crime (HO)</i>&mdash;This Bill will include a significant range of reserved provisions that will extend to Scotland. The Bill will also include measures that provide for the recognition and enforcement of English and Welsh Football Banning Orders in Scotland which will require an LCM.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.7/23"><i>Welfare Reform and Birth Registration (DWP)</i>&mdash;Social Security is a reserved matter and the Bill will include wider-ranging reserved provisions that will extend to Scotland. An LCM will be required to confer a regulation making power upon the Scottish Ministers so that they may include devolved funding streams within the &quot;right to control&quot;.</p>
