<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2002-11-19.11WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1169" speakername="John Prescott" speakeroffice="The Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State" colnum="11WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021119/wmstext/21119m01.htm#21119m01.html_spmin0">
	<p>We want to encourage people to stand as local councillors. We recognise their voluntary contribution as an important aspect of public life. We recognise that this commitment can be time-consuming, and therefore welcome employers encouraging their employees to serve as councillors by allowing them paid time-off to carry out their council duties.</p>
	<p>The Electoral Commission has published its view that, under Schedule 7 to the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (Xthe Act&quot;), the provision of such paid time-off should be treated as a political donation to the employee in his or her capacity as a holder of elective office. On the basis of this view, the value of such paid time-off must be reported to the Commission, where the total is more than #1,000 for each employee in the course of a year. In addition, employees will not lawfully be able to accept such paid time-off from their employers where these are not Xpermissible donors&quot; under the Act.</p>
	<p>The Government accepts that there has been uncertainty surrounding the issue. However, the Government's long-standing policy is that the provisions of the Act should not apply to the receipt by a councillor of paid time-off for carrying out his or her duty as a councillor. It would be clearly wrong for some employers not to be able to offer paid time-off to their employees to serve as councillors. Moreover requirements on other employers, and in some cases their employees, to calculate and to report the value of such paid time-off to the Electoral Commission would be a disincentive for employers from supporting employees who wish to serve as councillors.</p>
	<p>Consequently, we are proposing to include in the Local Government Bill, announced on 13 November in the Queen's Speech, amendments to Schedule 7 to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The effect of these amendments would be to exclude the value of any salary paid to an employee by an employer in respect of time-off taken in order to undertake duties as a local councillor from the definition of a donation in Schedule 7 to the Act. This would mean that it will be open to all employers to grant such paid time-off, and that the value of such time-off would not have to be reported to the Electoral Commission.</p>
	<p>We are providing for these amendments to apply with retrospective effect, so that any paid time-off which might have been granted to councillors since 16 February 2001, when the requirements of Schedule 7 to Act came into force, is not to be considered as a political donation.</p>

	Empty Homes
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2002-11-19.12WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government and the Regions" colnum="12WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021119/wmstext/21119m01.htm#21119m01.html_spmin1">
	<p>The Government recognises that council tax information may be useful to local authority empty homes services in their work to get such property back into use. However, it is unclear whether legislation as it currently stands allows either personal or non-personal information collected for council tax purposes to be divulged to, or used by, other parts of an authority and we are aware that the Information Commissioner has advised that the legislation does not permit such uses of council tax personal information.</p>
	<p>The Government has therefore decided to legislate in the forthcoming Local Government Bill to make it clear local authorities can use personal and non-personal council tax information to support the development and implementation of strategies dealing with empty homes. In legislating, we will ensure that personal information will be limited to an individual's name or an address or number for communicating with him. I believe this is a sensible and proportionate response which will help get more long term empty domestic property back into use.</p>

	<p>In the light of responses to last November's consultation paper on proposed changes for second homes and long term empty homes, we have decided to give local authorities new discretion in relation to council tax discounts and exemptions.</p>
	<p>Firstly, we will allow English local authorities to reduce council tax discounts on second homes from 50 per cent to a minimum 10 per cent. Authorities in the areas where the discount has been reduced will retain any additional council tax raised. We do not propose to reduce their revenue support grant to reflect their ability to raise more council tax. The changes could raise an estimated extra #65 million in England and authorities will be able to decide how to spend this money to improve local public services, such as affordable housing, transport or policing.</p>
	<p>We have decided not to remove the discount completely because owners need an incentive to inform the local authority that properties are second homes. Without such information, local authorities would not be able to identify the extra revenue which could be raised from changing the discount.</p>
	<p>We recognise the special position of those who are required to live in tied accommodation provided by their employer or because of a legal requirement, such as a condition of a licence. A discount of 50 per cent will continue to apply in these cases.</p>
	<p>Secondly, we will allow English local authorities to reduce or remove completely the current 50 per cent council tax discounts on long term empty dwellings. Authorities will not retain any additional revenue raised. This is because we believe that decisions on whether to end the discount should be based purely on whether the measure is likely to make owners consider bringing their properties back into use.</p>
	<p>Thirdly, we will give local authorities in England and Wales powers to create their own discounts and exemptions, including powers to grant relief on a case by case basis. Authorities exercising these powers will meet the costs of any new discounts or exemptions.</p>
	<p>These decisions follow consultation on the proposals which demonstrated strong support for the reduction of discounts on second and long-term empty homes.</p>
	<p>An analysis of the responses to the consultation exercise has already been placed in the Library of the House and on the web-site of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p>These measures require primary legislation. As we said in the consultation draft of our Local Government Bill published on 12 June, we plan to add these measures to this Bill before it is introduced.</p>

	<p>We will today launch the XSuccess for All&quot; strategy for reforming further education and training. XSuccess for All&quot; will build on the strengths and systematically tackle the weaknesses within the learning and skills sector, through a programme of reforms which will:</p>
	<p class="indent">improve the responsiveness, design and quality of provision in each locality to meet learner, employer and community needs, with providers focusing on their individual strengths;</p>
	<p class="indent">achieve excellence in teaching and learning across the sector by identifying, creating and disseminating good, learning materials and training and support practice programmes;</p>
	<p class="indent">improve leadership, raise the number of qualified teachers, managers and support staff in the sector, and ensure better rewards for high performing staff; and</p>
	<p class="indent">Establish a new planning, funding and accountability system for providers in the sector.</p>
	<p>This strategy represents a vote of confidence for the learning and skills sector, and will be supported by our largest ever investment programme in further education and training:</p>
	<p class="indent">the total planned funding for further education allocated to the Learning and Skills Council will rise by #1.2 billion by 2005&ndash;6 compared to 2002&ndash;3, a 19 per cent. real terms increase in 3 years;</p>
	<p class="indent">all learning and skills providers will negotiate 3-year funding deals based on agreed assumptions on participation levels;</p>
	<p class="indent">capital funding for the whole learning and skills sector allocated to the LSC will rise by over 60 per cent. in real terms by 2005&ndash;6 compared to 2002&ndash;3; and</p>
	<p class="indent">funding of over #40million in 2003&ndash;4 rising to over #100 million in the year 2005&ndash;6, to deliver a major programme of training and support for teachers and trainers across the learning and skills sector in response to area reviews and inspection findings.</p>
	<p>For further education and sixth form colleges, we will provide new money sufficient to raise the core unit of funding by 2 per cent. each year in real terms, on average. Targeted funds for college pay and staff training will also be consolidated into core funding, further boosting the core unit of funding by at least 3.5 per cent. from 2003&ndash;4.</p>
	<p>Higher funding rates will be paid to colleges who perform well in meeting the needs of learners and employers. Poor performing colleges will get lower increases. Where necessary they will receive additional support and intervention until they improve. By 2005&ndash;6, this investment should enable a substantial narrowing of the core funding gap between FE and school sixth forms, and of the pay gap for staff between general FE colleges and schools.</p>
	<p>We are also committed to further investment in work based learning providers to deliver the major reform of Modern Apprenticeships recommended by the MA Advisory Committee under Sir John Cassels, and the PSA target of 28 per cent. of young people entering MAs before they are 22 by 2004. We will make further announcements in due course about assumed funding for work based learning and adult and community learning.</p>

	<p>The Medical Manning and Retention Review has recently been completed. It was conducted inclusively, with the involvement of the British Medical and Dental Associations and NHS representation. The Review was undertaken against the background of serious manning shortfalls among medical and dental officers in the Defence Medical Services (DMS). It complements the work of the Medical Quinquennial Review (MQR) and its recommendations will be taken forward in parallel with those of the MQR. The Review will inform the Ministry of Defence paper of evidence to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) for the 2003 pay round.</p>
	<p>The Review has involved a detailed examination of the manning requirement and how this should be met. It has also examined the factors which influence medical and dental officer manning and, to assist in this, an independent human resources consultant was employed to obtain the views of serving medical and dental officers and those who had recently left the Armed Forces. As part of the Review, comparisons were made with pay and conditions of service in the NHS and other potential areas of employment. The MOD's existing proposals for aligning the terms of service of medical and dental officers across the three Services were also re-examined.</p>
	<p>The Review concluded that three main issues needed to be addressed if the necessary improvements in recruitment and retention were to be achieved: overstretch; pay and pensions; and the quality of life. It made a number of recommendations covering both remuneration and non-financial issues. The main recommendations are:</p>
	<p class="indent">New pay arrangements, endorsed by the AFPRB, which will form the basis for our evidence on medical and dental officers' pay to the AFPRB early in the New Year. It is planned that the new pay structure will be implemented in two phases; the first, which contains most of the changes, with effect from 1 April 2003, and the second with effect from 1 April 2004;</p>
	<p class="indent">Interim improvements to the pension arrangements for DMS medical and dental officers in advance of the introduction of a final salary scheme for all military personnel around 2005&ndash;6;</p>
	<p class="indent">Introduction of XGolden hellos&quot; not exceeding #50,000 gross for a commensurate 5-year return of service to improve direct entry recruiting in those medical specialities that are in short supply and have a significant deployment base.</p>
	<p>The Review also addressed the need further to strengthen management processes across the DMS and proposed a range of recommendations encompassing management, career and quality of life issues which will receive urgent action.</p>
	<p>The outcome of the Review will provide a significant opportunity to build on the work of the MQR and maintain focus on the two key defence medical outputs&mdash;deployable operational medical capability, and timely appropriate healthcare for Service personnel. The Government is committed to providing modern and forward-looking Defence Medical Services fit to meet the challenges we expect to face in the twenty-first century.</p>
