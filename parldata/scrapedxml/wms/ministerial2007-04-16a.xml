	<p pid="a.1WS.5/1">The Department for Constitutional Affairs has published &quot;Civil Court Fees&quot;, a consultation paper, which sets out proposals to:</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/2" class="indent">reform the system of fee exemptions and remissions;</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/3" class="indent">increase fees for civil business in magistrates' courts; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/4" class="indent">re-balance the fee structure in the other civil courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/5">The purpose of the consultation is to identify in the package of proposals whether&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/6" class="indent">(1) the new system of fee concessions is well-targeted, simple, transparent and consistent;</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/7" class="indent">(2) the re-balanced structure of civil fees provides a closer match between income and cost drivers within the system; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/8" class="indent">(3) the particular increase in an individual fee might have specific untoward consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/9">Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and can also be obtained free on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/confr.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/confr.htm</a>#full.

	<p pid="a.1WS.8/1">I wish to announce formally the appointment of Sir Michael Lyons as the new chairman of the BBC. Her Majesty the Queen approved his appointment in Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-04">4 April</phrase> and it will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 May</phrase> for a period of four years. Sir Michael brings a very wide range of experience and skills to the task of leading the BBC Trust in its role of representing the interests of licence fee payers, and in holding to account the executive board, which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the BBC. He and his colleagues on the Trust have a unique part to play in the future of public service broadcasting thorough their continued delivery of the new model of governance at the BBC and I am confident that, in Sir Michael, the BBC will have a chairman of whom it can be proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.8/2">The process by which Sir Michael was appointed followed the guidance of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA), and was scrutinised by an OCPA independent assessor throughout. The post was advertised in the national press and on the DCMS and Cabinet Office websites, shortlisted candidates were interviewed by a selection panel who made recommendations to DCMS Ministers, who then made recommendations to the Queen through the Prime Minister. I am delighted that this rigorous open competition has resulted in the appointment of a very able and enthusiastic chairman who will help to ensure the BBC continues to thrive and adapt to new challenges in a changing environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.8/3">I should also take this opportunity to express my tremendous gratitude to Dr. Chitra Bharucha who has, as acting chairman of the BBC, successfully overseen the launch of the new Trust. She will continue to support the Trust and its new chairman in her capacity as vice-chairman.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-04-16a.2WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for International Development" colnum="2WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070416/wmstext/70416m0001.htm#0704169000053">
	<p pid="a.2WS.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-04">4 April</phrase>, the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action, I announced that the UK will commit &pound;30 million to mine action over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.5/2">It is now eight years since the UK ratified the Mine Ban Treaty (the Ottawa convention). Since 2001 the Department for International Development has contributed at least &pound;10 million per year on global mine action. Much has been achieved by the international community during this period: mine casualties continue to decline; there is virtually no trading of anti-personnel mines anywhere in the world; over 30 million stockpiled anti-personnel mines have been destroyed; and large areas of land have been cleared of mines and rendered productive again. The UK has made a significant contribution to this in a number of badly affected countries. For example, since 2002 DFID has spent over &pound;6.5 million on demining projects in Afghanistan; during that time the number of casualties has more than halved. Similarly DFID has provided over &pound;2 million in Cambodia where the number of casualties has dropped from over 1,500 per year in the early 1990s to under 500 in 2006. More recently, following the conflict in Lebanon last year, DFID provided over &pound;2.5 million for rapid response to remove cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance from residential and agricultural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.5/3">Despite this, there remains much to be done. Casualty rates in the worst affected countries remain unacceptably high, as does the social and economic impact. Many countries are still heavily dependent on the support of the international community to deal with mines that contaminate their land.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.5/4">Over the next three years, we will focus our assistance on direct mine action, and building developing country capacity to carry out mine action while continuing to encourage countries to ratify the Ottawa convention. We will aim to reduce the impact of mines in developing countries through support to well established and effective de-mining organisations, and we will help mine affected countries develop the means to manage and deal with the remaining problems themselves.</p>
