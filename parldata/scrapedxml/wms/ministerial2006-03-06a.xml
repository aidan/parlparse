<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-06a.47WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence" colnum="47WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060306/wmstext/60306m01.htm#60306m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.47WS.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has today announced the award of a contract to AgustaWestland for the Integrated Merlin Operational Support (IMOS) programme, part of the wider Defence Logistics Transformation Programme, which seeks to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of military logistics support to the front line.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.2/2">IMOS is a radical departure from the current method of supporting the Merlin helicopter: in-service support of the Navy and Air Force Merlin variants will be fused, under IMOS, into a single, innovative, availability-based contract. IMOS will focus support activities for Merlin at the Main Support Base recently established at RNAS Culdrose. It will provide comprehensive technical servicing including supply and Depth servicing, and it will incentivise industry to improve aircraft availability to the Front Line while reducing costs through-life.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.2/3">The 25-year contract is worth approximately &pound;450 million over the first five years and will result in approximately 20 per cent. savings&mdash;some &pound;1 billion, over the 25 year life of the aircraft. The IMOS programme will complement the Defence Logistic Organisation's broader strategy to relocate the majority of support to the single most effective site, which is already showing early success with the Harrier and Tornado Fleets.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.2/4">As set out in the Defence Industrial Strategy, the MoD is working to establish a Multi-Platform Strategic Partnering Arrangement with AgustaWestland. IMOS is a key element of this strategy which sets out to enable the delivery of improved output at reduced cost to the MoD while allowing industry to benefit from greater openness and business opportunity.</p>
