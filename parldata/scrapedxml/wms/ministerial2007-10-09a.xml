<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-09a.27WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" speakername="David Miliband" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs" colnum="27WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071009/wmstext/71009m0001.htm#07100935000069">
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-08">8 August</phrase> the Prime Minister announced a review of the Government's assistance to our locally engaged staff in Iraq. The Defence Secretary, Home Secretary, Secretary of State for International Development, Chief Secretary to the Treasury and I have now agreed on the elements of a scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/2">Locally engaged Iraqi staff working for our armed forces and civilian missions in Iraq have made an invaluable contribution, in uniquely difficult circumstances, to the UK's efforts to support security, stability and development in the new Iraq. We are hugely grateful to them for their contribution, which continues to be essential to the delivery of our mission in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/3">In recognition of that, we have decided to offer those staff, on an ex gratia basis, assistance which goes above and beyond the confines of what is lawfully or contractually required. Assistance will be based on objective criteria, taking into account determinable and relevant factors. It is offered in recognition of the service by these courageous Iraqis in direct support of HMG's efforts to help the Iraqi Government and people build a peaceful, stable and prosperous Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/4">The assistance announced by the Prime Minister yesterday will allow Iraqi staff, including but not limited to interpreters, currently working<sup>(1)</sup> for HMG in Iraq, who have attained 12 months or more continuous service, to apply for a one-off package of financial assistance of between six and 12 months salary, depending on length of service, to meet the costs of relocation for themselves and their dependants in Iraq or the region, if they are made redundant or have to resign from their job because of what we judge to be exceptional circumstances. Alternatively, these staff will be able to apply for exceptional leave to enter the UK, or to avail themselves of the opportunity for resettlement in the UK through the UK's Gateway refugee resettlement programme, provided that they meet the criteria for the programme, including that they satisfy UNHCR that they meet the criteria of the 1951 convention and need resettlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/5">In addition, interpreters/translators and other Iraqi staff serving in similarly skilled or professional roles necessitating the regular use of written or spoken English, who formerly worked for HMG in Iraq, will be able to apply for assistance for themselves and their dependants provided that they satisfactorily completed a minimum of 12 months service, and they were in our employ on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>. Former staff meeting those criteria will be able to apply for a one-off package of financial assistance similar to that available for serving staff, or to avail themselves of the opportunity for resettlement in the UK through the Gateway programme as set out above.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/6">This assistance will principally apply to Iraqi nationals who meet the eligibility criteria set out above, and who work, or have worked, in Iraq in the following capacities:</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/7" class="indent">as direct employees of the UK armed forces or the Ministry of Defence;</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/8" class="indent">on letters of appointment from the British embassy in Baghdad or the British embassy offices in Basra and the Kurdistan region;</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/9" class="indent">as direct employees of DFID and the British Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/10">In addition, we are considering what assistance may be provided to a limited number of contracted staff meeting the eligibility criteria who have worked in particularly close association with us as an integral part of HMG programmes, projects and operations in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/11">We will announce further details, including on how eligible staff may apply, before the end of the month.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.2/12" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup>defined as those working for our civilian missions or armed forces on or after <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-08">8 August 2007</phrase>, the date on which the review of policy was announced.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-09a.28WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="28WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071009/wmstext/71009m0001.htm#07100935000070">
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/1">The informal Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council was held in Lisbon on the 1 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-02">2 October 2007</phrase>. The Home Secretary, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget Prentice) and I attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The following main issues were discussed at the Council and, since it was an informal Council, no formal decisions were taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/2">The first session opened with an introduction to the new counter-terrorism co-ordinator, Gilles de Kerchove. The presidency stressed that he would need to be a key link between the Commission and the Council. The Commission introduced the legislative package it was planning to present in November which would include an amended framework decision on terrorism, work on explosives, and an EU system for the exchange of passenger name records.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/3">The UK thanked member states for their support in tackling terrorism in the UK and acknowledged that terrorism was an EU-wide problem. The UK and others highlighted the importance of data sharing and using databases to support law enforcement to strengthen the EU's security. The UK supported targeted information exchange. The presidency concluded that preventing radicalisation needed joining up of all information sources. There would be further discussion at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/4">In a discussion on deportation with assurances, the UK emphasised that deportation was an important tool, but exposed a difficult balance: ensuring we could deport an individual deemed a risk to our security while protecting that individual's rights. The UK fully endorsed the use of technology, for example CCTV, in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/5">The presidency subsequently introduced its paper on the importance of automatic border crossing systems and the Schengen information system. The Commission expanded on this paper by stating that existing visa systems were outdated and, in the medium-term, the EU should look to implement a comprehensive entry/exit system. This was broadly welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/6">The UK welcomed work on inter-operable systems noting that the use of screening technology had facilitated over 1,200 arrests in the UK. Iris recognition helped ease passage through airports, and gave confidence in identity. The UK advocated sharing such technology since it would enhance member state security.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/7">Member states agreed to use new technologies in border control, with the right protections. Frontex was an essential tool for border management and there was agreement that biometric passports were needed in the EU, and around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/8">On e-justice, member states confirmed that work should continue on the basis of the Council's decision in June. While electronic means of working should be encouraged, there should not be any legislation making the use of e-justice methods compulsory. Rather, work should continue on the basis of the sharing of best practice. It was agreed that the proposed e-justice portal should include information on missing and abducted children.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/9">Child protection was discussed on the second day of the Council. The UK highlighted the issue of monitoring sex offenders across the EU. While acknowledging offenders right to re-build their lives, liberty needed to be balanced with the risk of re-offending through proportionate monitoring measures. However some member states had their concerns. The UK supported any practical measures to track missing children, and suggested a child abduction taskforce, to look at solutions across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/10">Member states recommended efficient co-operation and working with relevant national authorities, EU bodies and agencies allowing for joint and co-ordinated work on the prevention and fight against child abuse. Member states agreed that co-operation and exchange of information between relevant national authorities and Europol and Eurojust must be reinforced. EU Ministers accepted that promoting a legislative solution was not the only answer to the problem but that the adoption of concrete measures at EU level led to effective and immediate improvement of child protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.28WS.2/11">Member states agreed to interconnect (already existing in some member states) national child alert systems. This could be implemented without any legislation, complementing co-operation between relevant national authorities. It was agreed that crimes committed against children via the internet should be condemned and punished; the Commission was asked to present proposals for measures designed to improve prevention and the fight against those actions. EU Ministers recommended that European and international legislative instruments to fight cybercrime committed against minors should be ratified and enforced by member states. EU Ministers strongly agreed that the promotion of children's rights and the protection of children must constitute a priority in the context of external relations, namely with the EU's neighbour countries.</p>
