	<p pid="a.25WS.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-12-16.1798"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1798</phrase>, as part of the wider programme to modernise the UK's defence capabilities, the then Secretary of State for Defence announced to the House the Government's intention to create two new units that would significantly improve the specialist support to the Special Forces and enhance our global capacity to fight terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="a.25WS.8/9" class="italic">Sustainable Development</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/10">The Council had a discussion with a view to helping the Presidency prepare a renewed EU sustainable development strategy to be adopted at the June European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/11">In June 2005, the European Council adopted a declaration on guiding principles for sustainable development based on the four principles of environmental protection, social equity and cohesion; economic prosperity; and meeting international responsibilities. In December 2005, it looked forward to adopting in June 2006 an ambitious and comprehensive strategy, comprising targets, indicators and an effective monitoring procedure, integrating the internal and external dimensions and based on a positive long-term vision, bringing together the Community's sustainable development priorities and objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/12" class="italic">Belarus</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/13">The Presidency recalled the serious shortcomings in the conduct of the Presidential election of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> and the Council's agreement at its meetings on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase> to take action if the election was not conducted according to international standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/14">There was broad support in the Council for a firm EU response to the elections.

	<p pid="a.25WS.8/16">The Council adopted Conclusions deploring the Presidential elections as neither free nor fair, condemning the violence used by the Belarusian authorities against demonstrators and arrests of members of the opposition and implementing restrictive measures against those responsible for the violations of international electoral standards as well as the crackdown on civil society and democratic opposition.</p>

This is a precautionary measure, pending conclusion of a review of EU assistance to the Palestinians. Aid to support basic human needs including health and education of the Palestinian people would continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/22">The Council agreed Conclusions expressing grave concern at the Palestinian Government's failure to commit itself to the Quartet principles; urging the Government to meet and implement these principles and to commit to President Abbas' platform of peace and outlining the EU's review of assistance against the Government's commitment to these principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/23" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/24">High Representative Solana presented a paper that set out options for future EU policy towards Iran. The Council agreed Conclusions calling on Iran to fulfil International Atomic Energy Agency Board/UN requirements to suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, welcoming the conclusions of the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase> Ministerial in Berlin and underlining the EU's continued concern about the human rights situation in Iran.</p>

	<p pid="a.25WS.8/28" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Flooding in the Danube</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/29">Member states were briefed on the floods in central and south-east Europe. Some of the worst affected member states were examining the possibility of applying for EU assistance under the solidarity fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.25WS.8/31">Romania briefed the Council on the decision at the High Level meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> in Bucharest to launch negotiations on a regional free trade agreement on the basis of a Central Europe Free Trade Agreement.</p>

	<p pid="a.25WS.8/36">The Presidency opened by recalling the December 2005 agreement of the European Council for a 10th EDF of &euro;22.682 billion, and emphasising that member states now needed to transfer this into an operational framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/37">Development Ministers discussed the Commission's proposals to top-up the &euro;22.682 billion figure with additional resources to fund (1) activities in Overseas Countries and Territories and (2) the Commission's administrative costs associated with the implementation of the EDF. The matter was referred back to COREPER by the Presidency for further discussion and decision. The Commission also updated the Council on the implementation of the Africa Strategy and on Commission activities which were being undertaken as part of the strategy.

	<p pid="a.25WS.8/44">The Presidency noted the Commission's rolling work programme for Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) and, following a brief exchange of views, the Council adopted Conclusions on the PCD reaffirming the importance of policy coherence, inviting member states and the Commission to develop a more detailed rolling work programme by June 2006 and highlighting specific priority areas for action and a timetable on PCD.</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/45" class="italic">Reform of Humanitarian Assistance: exchange of views</p>
	<p pid="a.25WS.8/46">The Presidency opened the discussion by recognising the scope for better coordination between the areas of crisis management/civilian protection and humanitarian assistance. Development Ministers drew attention to various areas, including the UN's Central Emergency Revolving Fund; the idea of a humanitarian ombudsman or an annual global report on humanitarian assistance; the role of the Peace Building Commission in providing assistance beyond the initial humanitarian response; and the need for greater coherency between the Commission and Council. The Presidency will organise an event on humanitarian assistance to further discussion.</p>

	<p pid="a.29WS.2/1">The Government have previously made statements on the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe on <phrase class="date" code="">27 June</phrase>, 6 and <phrase class="date" code="">18 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-14">14 December 2005</phrase>. I would like to provide a further update.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April</phrase> the Court of Appeal allowed our appeal against two determinations of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT). The court found that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal had erred in its approach to the evidence before it in finding that the particular way we were enforcing returns of failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers to Harare airport put them at risk of mistreatment. The AIT's determination in that case has therefore been set aside and the AIT will consider the case afresh.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/3">We also welcome the Court of Appeal's further finding that a person who can safely return to their country of origin voluntarily is not a refugee. The Government remain deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Zimbabwe and we are fully committed to providing protection to those who need it. For those who do, the asylum decision making and independent appeals system ensure that they get an appropriate form of protection, and the question of their removal does not arise. But it cannot be right that people who would face no risk if they returned to their country of origin voluntarily should, because they refuse to do so, be entitled to the same status as people who have a genuine fear of persecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/4">In line with our original undertaking to the High Court, we will not be enforcing returns to Zimbabwe pending the further hearing the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal is now required to hold. However, we continue to expect those who have exhausted their rights of appeal and been found not to need international protection to leave the UK voluntarily. We can if required assist them in doing so through the International Organization for Migration (IOM).</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/5">Since the tribunal hearing of October 2005, we have been reviewing our methods of return, and have continued to build upon our already strong networks and relationships with NGOs, international organisations and civil society on the ground in Zimbabwe to strengthen our capacity to monitor the treatment of both enforced and voluntary returnees.</p>
