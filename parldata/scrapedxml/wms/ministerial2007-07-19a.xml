	<p pid="a.29WS.2/69">The bulk of these units represent direct replacements for the Afghanistan deployments I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase>,<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-02-01.19"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 19-20WS</phrase>, and <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-26">26 February 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-02-26.619"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 619-635</phrase>. The House will be aware, however, that all military operations are subject to regular review. As a result, I have therefore agreed to deploy an additional troop of the highly regarded VIKING Protected Mobility Vehicles, manned by Royal Marines and the Queen's Royal Lancers, to enhance further the Task Force Helmand's ability to manoeuvre. In addition, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-01">1 August 2007</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-31">31 July 2008</phrase> the UK will act as Principal Co-ordinating Nation for NATO's management of Kandahar airfield. I am also considering options to enhance our support for the Afghan National Security Forces In consequence the total UK commitment in Afghanistan is likely to be around 7,800 by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/70">Volunteer and Regular members of the reserve forces will continue to deploy to Afghanistan as part of this integrated force package, and we expect to have eventually issued in the order of 750 call-out notices to fill over 600 posts. On completion of their mobilisation procedures, the reservists will undertake a period of training and, where applicable, integration with their respective receiving units. The majority will serve on operations for six or seven months, although some may have shorter tours. As part of this commitment, we expect up to 20 members of the Sponsored reserves to be in Theatre at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/71">The House will recall too, the importance I attach to burden-sharing within the International Security Assistance Force. In this context, I should like to welcome the recent decision by the Danish parliament to increase their deployment in Helmand. Operating under 52 Infantry Brigade's command will be a Danish Battlegroup which, building on our close co-operation with Danish forces in Iraq, will exercise tactical command over two British infantry companies. This important increase in the Danish contribution to Task Force Helmand is a significant boost to its operational capability and its capacity to help stabilise and secure Helmand province.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-19a.33WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" speakername="David Miliband" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs" colnum="33WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/wmstext/70719m0002.htm#07071988000297">
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/1">The Voluntary Vetting Scheme (VVS) is an arrangement designed to prevent states of proliferation concern using the UK as a training ground for their scientists and engineers. It is administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and seeks co-operation from universities in identifying postgraduate applicants of proliferation concern. The Government asses the proliferation risk and inform the university, which then decides whether or not to offer a place to the applicant.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/2">As the proliferation threat has evolved, we have looked again at whether there is room to improve the scheme. In particular, and as recommended by the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), we have looked at the scope to make it compulsory, so that we catch a greater proportion of students of potential concern. We have also looked to shift the emphasis from universities to Government, where both feel it properly belongs.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/3" class="italic">Proposed Changes</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/4">In essence, the student section of the Immigration Rules contains a requirement for certain postgraduate students to have prior counter-proliferation clearance in order to qualify for a visa. The proposed new scheme&mdash;the Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)&mdash;requires all non-EEA students in the designated categories to apply for Counter-Proliferation (CP) clearance. Details of the disciplines affected by these provisions will appear in the 'Rules'. There is also a requirement to obtain CP clearance when students wish to extend their stay in the UK (for example, when moving from undergraduate studies to a postgraduate programme that is covered by the provisions of the new scheme). Clearance (in the form of a certificate) will be obtained through the FCO, using an easy-to-use, online form, and we aim to process the vast majority of applications within 10 working days. A separate clearance certificate will be required for each separate institution or programme of study.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/5">We estimate that the ATAS will substantially increase the proportion of students of potential concern who are subject to scrutiny. At the same time, we would tighten the scheme considerably by assessing predominantly PhD and Masters by research students, rather than all postgraduate students of potential concern, as was the case under the VVS. However, we would still wish to assess the small number of students wishing to undertake taught Masters studies in Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering or Materials Technology, due to potential CP concerns. This allows us to target the areas of greatest concern more efficiently and in a manner proportionate to the threat. It is in line with the Government's publicly stated CP policy, and is a useful reaffirmation of our commitment. The academic community has also been extensively consulted and is supportive of the new scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/6" class="italic">Timing</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/7">We anticipate implementing a voluntary go-live date for the scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-03">Monday 3 September 2007</phrase>. From this date onwards we will be seeking volunteers from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to advise their students to apply for ATAS clearance. However it will not be a mandatory requirement under the Immigration Rules at this point and we will continue operating the VVS during this transition period. Assuming no problems are found we would have a mandatory go-live date of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase> with a corresponding amendment to the Immigration Rules. This date has been decided after consultation with the UK academic community and allows them to deal with their busiest time for new arrivals, that is; September and October, without having to produce amended offer letters to meet the ATAS requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.35WS.1/1">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-23">23 July</phrase> in Brussels. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs will represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/3">General Affairs</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/4" class="italic">4th Cohesion Report</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/5">Commissioner for Regional Policy, Danuta H&uuml;bner, is expected to brief the Council on the 4th Cohesion report, which provides an update on economic, social and territorial cohesion. It also provides an analysis of the impact of cohesion policy at national and Community level in the EU. The report also asks a series of questions to guide discussion: can cohesion policy can adapt to the new challenges facing regions in the coming years; can it further develop an integrated and more flexible approach to development/growth and jobs; and how adequate is the policy management system for 2007-13? The Government welcome these questions as a basis for debate, providing the discussion does not prejudge the fundamental review of the EU's budget taking place in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/6">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/7" class="italic">Doha Development Round</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/8">Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson, is expected to brief the Council on the latest negotiations in the Doha development round. The Council is expected to discuss next steps including work to be taken forward by the chairs of the groups on agriculture and non-agricultural market access. The Government want an ambitious, pro-development outcome to the Doha development round and supports the role of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/9" class="italic">Ukraine</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/10">The Council will be briefed by the presidency on preparations for the EU-Ukraine summit on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-14">14 September</phrase>. The Council is also expected to endorse a note, which the Government fully support, setting out the EU's objectives for the summit, which include taking stock of developments in the EU-Ukraine relationship, and discussing the ongoing process of reform in Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/11" class="italic">Sudan/Darfur</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/12">We expect discussion at the Council to focus on options for EU engagement in Darfur and the region, including a range of areas in which the EU could support wider international efforts to resolve the Darfur crisis. The Government welcome these options, which set out ways in which the EU can support the political process in Darfur, improvements in the humanitarian and security situations, as well as effective African Union and UN peacekeeping in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/13">The Government will emphasise the importance of keeping the focus on the long-term economic future, development and reconstruction of Darfur and Sudan as a whole. The international community, including the EU, must provide the necessary planning and support to make this happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/14">The Council is also expected to discuss a French proposal for an EU military operation in Chad. The UK has long supported, including through UN Security Council Resolution 1706, the need for an international operation in Eastern Chad. An effective military force would be an important contribution to the regional strategy and the Government therefore welcome the French proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/15" class="italic">Lybia</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/16">External Relations Commissioner, Benita Fererro-Waldner, is expected to update the Council on progress in the case of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff imprisoned in Libya.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/17" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/18">The High-Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, is expected to brief the Council on his recent discussions with AH Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator and secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, as part of the EU's agreed twin track approach. The Government welcome steps by Iran to resolve outstanding technical issues with the international atomic energy agency, but our position remains firm on the need to see full suspension, before suspension of UN sanctions can be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/19" class="italic">Middle East</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/20">The Council is expected to adopt conclusions on the Middle East emphasising support for Abbas and Fayyad's Government. The Council is likely to discuss support for building the capacity of Palestinian institutions and economic development, a position the Government support as an essential part of achieving success in political negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/21">On Lebanon, the Council is expected to adopt conclusions condemning the bomb attack on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-23">23 June</phrase> in which six peacekeepers were killed, and reiterating the need to implement UN Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1701 and 1757. The conclusions also welcome the meeting held by France to build confidence between the main parties and help work towards a reconciliation of the political crisis in Lebanon.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/22" class="italic">Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/23">Discussion is likely to focus on Kosovo. The Government will want to ensure EU resolve in seeing former President Ahtisaari's proposals through to a successful conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/24" class="italic">Russia</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/25">The Government will brief the Council on latest developments in the Litvinenko case.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/26" class="italic">Zimbabwe</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/27">The Government will raise Zimbabwe to highlight the need for continued EU engagement in response to the deteriorating situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.1/28" class="italic">Resolution 1562 of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-19a.38WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="38WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/wmstext/70719m0003.htm#07071988000301">
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/1">The Department for Transport is today issuing an interim report on the Ports Policy Review. This Review was launched last summer by my predecessor <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr Stephen Ladyman)</phrase>, with the publication of a discussion document, &quot;Ports Policy &mdash; Your Views Invited<i>&quot;</i>. A summary of the responses to this consultation are available to view on the Department for Transport's website <a href="http://www.dft.gsi.gov.uk">www.dft.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/2">Also published alongside the discussion document were reports by the Department's consultants, MDS Transmodal, on freight demand forecasts for ports, and on container transhipment. The consultants have updated some aspects of these reports and their further report will also be made available on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/3">Sir Rod Eddington's report, &quot;Transport's role in sustaining the UK's productivity<i></i>and competitiveness<i>&quot;,</i> was published in December. We are studying Sir Rod's recommendations and will respond to them later in the year. Several of these bear closely on ports policy and especially on the need to co-ordinate it fully with policy on each of the surface transport modes connecting with ports.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/4">Also relevant to ports policy are the consultations, one recently closed and the other still in progress, on the Government's Marine Bill White Paper, and on the White Paper &quot;Planning for a Sustainable Future<i>&quot;</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/5">I want to ensure that ports policy reflects emerging conclusions from each of these strands of work. It will not therefore be possible to complete the Ports Policy Review until later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/6">We are, however, already in a position to set out conclusions on important aspects of the overall policy framework for the ports sector. The Interim Report issued today recognises that commercial ports are best placed to make decisions about where and when to invest in the port sector, and that we do not propose any substantive change to the regulatory and operating framework for ports.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/7">But it is the Government's responsibility to create the conditions in which investment is encouraged, and yet sustainability is ensured. This report sets out policies to build on the ports industry's success, including by:</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/8" class="indent">commissioning demand forecasts every five years to aid assessment of national need;</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/9" class="indent">recommending the use of Master Plans by major ports to improve planning;</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/10" class="indent">setting out broad guidelines on the safeguarding of port land;</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/11" class="indent">the pursuit of further trust port modernisation; and</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/12" class="indent">setting out our plans to enhance the port safety regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/13">In parallel with the Interim Report, the Government are also making their formal Response to the Transport Committee's report of its inquiry into &quot;The Ports Industry in England and Wales<i>&quot; </i>(HC61-1). I am grateful to the Committee for having expedited its inquiry so as to contribute to the Review. We have accepted a number of the Committee's recommendations, and even in those areas where we have not found ourselves able to do so, the evidence-gathering process has very usefully complemented the Department's own consultation</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-19a.39WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" speakername="Tom Harris" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="39WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/wmstext/70719m0003.htm#07071988000302">
	<p pid="a.39WS.1/1">The Welsh Assembly Government and the Department for Transport have published the Regional Planning Assessment for the railway in Wales (WRPA), the final document in the series of RPAs covering England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.1/2">Copies of the document have been placed in the Libraries of the House and can also be downloaded from the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.1/3">The Wales RPA covers the whole of Wales and an area to the east of the border, including the Marches line which has an important role in north / south rail traffic for Wales. Key rail links into England are also included.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.1/4">RPAs provide the link between regional spatial planning (including preparation of regional transport strategies) and planning for the railway by both Government and the rail industry, and are designed to inform the development of the Government's strategy for the railway. They look at the challenges and options for development of the railway over the next 20 years, in the wider context of forecast change in population, the economy and travel behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.1/5">An RPA does not commit the Government to specific proposals. Instead it sets out the Government's current thinking on how the railway might best be developed to allow wider planning objectives for a region or country to be met, and identifies the priorities for further development work.</p>
	<p pid="a.39WS.1/6">The Secretary of State for Transport is responsible for specifying the infrastructure outputs which central Government want the railway to deliver in England and Wales, and the funding available, over a five-year period. As co-signatory to the Wales and Border franchise agreement with the Secretary of State, the Welsh Assembly Government are responsible for the financial and performance management of passenger services covered by the agreement and any enhancements to it. The Welsh Assembly Government are also working in partnership with Network Rail to fund enhancements to the railway infrastructure in Wales.</p>
