<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-22a.140WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing" colnum="140WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071122/wmstext/71122m0001.htm#07112240000388">
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/1">The Government set out their approach and criteria for phasing the implementation of Home Information Packs (HIPs) including Energy Performance Certificates on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June</phrase>. Sixty per cent of the market is now covered by HIPs. And the criteria for roll out to the rest of the market have now been met. We will therefore complete the phased roll out by extending coverage to the rest of the market from <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/2">First time buyers of one and two bedroom homes will be the main beneficiaries as they will now get important information about their new home for free. Information such as searches for which they would previously have had to pay will now be included in the HIP paid for by the seller, reducing the costs of the first step onto the property ladder.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/3">But all householders will benefit from having detailed information about the energy efficiency of their home, and measures to save on their fuel bills and cut carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/4">Two hundred thousand Energy Performance Certificates have been generated since the summer. The analysis of the early phase of rollout of HIPs found that the average rating for homes was an E, and we know that approximately one-fifth of all homes are likely to get an F or G rating. This means that basic measures could significantly cut both fuel bills and carbon emissions. The Energy Savings Trust have also estimated that homeowners could also save around &pound;300 a year on fuel bills from implementing the recommendations in the Energy Performance Certificate.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/5">We will establish a new Green Homes Service to offer those buying or selling a home with an F or G rating free or discounted help with energy efficiency measures, by linking them up with grants and loans provided by energy companies and others. Home buyers could potentially be eligible for hundreds of pounds to get help with insulation or other improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/6">As set out in the criteria of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June</phrase> there are now sufficient energy assessors and home inspectors fully qualified and accredited to provide Energy Performance Certificates for all homes bought and sold. Some 5794 people are now accredited.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/7">In addition, the government has also conducted monitoring and analysis of the implementation programme to ensure continued smooth roll out. Early monitoring shows:</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/8" class="indent">HIPs are taking on average seven to 10 days to prepare.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/9" class="indent">The majority of property, and drainage and water searches, are being delivered within five days</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/10" class="indent">Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are being prepared on average within two to four days</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/11" class="indent">On average, a HIP costs between &pound;300 and &pound;350. Most of these are not new costs, as they cover the cost of searches and other documents which have simply been transferred from buyer to seller at the beginning of the process. The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) is of course new but provides consumers with valuable information of the costs of running their home.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/12" class="indent">Competition from HIPs is reducing the costs of average property searches. Eighty-five local authorities have already reduced their charges by &pound;30 on average.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/13">The Government have also commissioned and considered extensive analysis by Europe Economics on the impact of HIPs on the market. We are today publishing their independent report which includes modelling on the impact as well as analysis of the first few months of implementation. It finds no evidence of any impact on transactions or prices, although there is a predicted short term impact on new listings as sellers change the timings of their listings. It concludes that the impact on listings is short lived, and the impact on the market is marginal compared to the wider factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/14">We also asked Europe Economics and Dr. Peter Williams who is a member of the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit to consider whether changing housing market conditions meant we should change the approach to completing the roll out. Their conclusion was that there are strong arguments for rolling out as planned, and that further delay could cause greater difficulties and uncertainties in the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/15">In the light of this evidence therefore we will tomorrow lay the commencement order to extend HIPs and EPCs to one and two bedroom properties from <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>. In order to ensure continued smooth implementation, we are also extending the temporary provisions on first day marketing for all properties from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June</phrase>, providing flexibility for sellers as part of the roll out to one and two bedroom properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/16">The implementation of Home Information Packs so far, and the work of the Stakeholder Panel, has also highlighted further improvements that are needed to benefit consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/17">HIPs have already led to improvements in the delivery and cost of searches, with significant reductions in the cost of searches, and in some areas, substantial reductions in the delays in producing searches. However, there are still wide variations in costs and services and we want to see further improvements for consumers. We will therefore publish guidance on access and charging in December for local authorities and personal searchers with the aim of speeding up searches and delivering a fairer deal for consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/18">We have asked Ted Beardsall, Deputy Chief Executive of the Land Registry&mdash;and member of our Home Buying and Selling Stakeholder Panel&mdash;to advise on what else could be done to improve the search process, ensuring better quality and timeliness of information, and improving value for money for consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/19">Stakeholders have also raised concerns about the costs and timeliness of leasehold information, and the impact that this will have on Home Information Packs when one and two bedroom properties are included given the higher number of leasehold properties. In the majority of cases we would expect leasehold documents to be readily available and easily provided as part of Home Information Packs. However we are aware that some leaseholders, whether in the pre-existing system or creating a HIP, can find the relevant documents difficult to obtain quickly. We know that some also face disproportionate charges to access their documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/20">As leasehold information is an important part of the home buying and selling process, and is already generally paid for and provided by the seller, we continue to believe there are considerable advantages to consumers from having leasehold information early on in the Home Information Pack. However, to ensure continued smooth roll out we will phase the introduction of leasehold information in response to stakeholder concerns. We will temporarily amend the HIP regulations so that the lease document itself must be included, but other leasehold information will be introduced as a requirement in six months time. This will allow HIPs for one and two bedroom properties to bed down in advance of leasehold information being required. In the interim, we have also asked Ted Beardsall to advise us and the Home Buying Stakeholder panel on what more can be done to improve the timeliness and cost of leasehold information, alongside the work on searches.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/21">From April 2008, we will begin to roll out EPCs for newly built homes, as well as across commercial property for sale, rent or construction. By October 2008 all public buildings will have a display certificate.</p>
	<p pid="a.140WS.2/22">All these measures are designed to promote the interests of the consumer. We will continue to actively monitor the rollout of HIPs and energy performance certificates and the home buying and selling process to ensure we can respond where further improvements are needed. The introduction of HIPs is part of a wider programme of reforms to home buying and selling including e-conveyancing and better redress, which aims to provide consumers with a clearer, more transparent and effective service, with better value for money, benefiting all potential homebuyers and helping in tackling climate change.</p>

	<p pid="a.142WS.2/1">I promised to keep the House informed of matters relating to the FMD outbreak. An incident has occurred at the Merial facility on the Pirbright site. While the incident was contained, I thought it right to report the matter given the understandable public interest in this site.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase>, DEFRA restored the Specified Animal Pathogens Order (SAPO) licence to Merial Animal Health to permit the use of FMD and Bluetongue viruses for vaccine production. The licence was restored following detailed DEFRA and HSE inspections that confirmed that the terms of the licence (including operating procedures and installation of security measures) had been fully met and that it was safe for vaccine production to recommence.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/3">The licence requires several layers of biosecurity to be in place. This includes first, a new facility which has been installed to heat treat waste from virus production. Secondly it requires the re-lining, sealing and testing of the effluent pipes and man hole covers as identified in the HSE and Spratt reports. Thirdly, the ground above the drains has been made a contained area and all movements across it controlled with decontamination required of any one who has need to enter that area. Lastly all effluent passes into the chemical treatment facility, which as the final layer of biosecurity would deactivate any live virus. It is monitored and tested daily.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/4">All of these measures provide several independent layers of safety and ensure that the process is contained.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">Monday 19 November</phrase> Merial discovered a shortfall in the quantity of virus recovered from production batches from the previous week. On inspection of the vaccine production equipment they identified possible technical problems with the functioning of a valve on a pipe leading from the centrifuge which is used to separate live virus from waste product. Operations were immediately stopped and the machine and associated pipework were decontaminated with steam. Citric acid was added in bulk to the effluent sump to disinfect any live virus that might have leaked out of the centrifuge.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/6">Having been contacted on Monday, an engineer examined the machine on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>. No problems were identified with the centrifuge, and investigations focussed on a valve on a steam line used to sterilise the associated pipework. This valve separates the live virus product line from the line which provides an outlet for the condensate from the steam cleaning stages. This water should not come in contact with live virus, but as a precaution does enter the contained drainage system leading to the final chemical treatment facility. As part of the SAPO licence, we require Merial to apply rigorous standard operating procedures. In relation to the valves these mean that each time the centrifuge is used two operators must certify that the valve is locked shut and its integrity is confirmed by pressure tests before and after each batch. In addition the preventive maintenance system includes regular inspections and although the valves on the centrifuge have a three-year life expectancy they are replaced annually. All these checks must be recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/7">Despite these measures Merial judged that the valve had been leaking, allowing an unintended probable release of live FMD virus into the contained drainage system, which was then pumped to the final chemical treatment facility without being heat treated.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/8">During the course of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase> Merial arranged for the valve to be replaced and tested the centrifuge to ensure that it was now working properly. Merial informed DEFRA officials at 4pm of this incident and of the action that they had taken. Having learned of this possible breach of a SAPO licence condition, DEFRA suspended Merial's SAPO licence with immediate effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/9">A joint DEFRA, HSE and Veterinary Medicine Directorate inspection team visited the site yesterday morning. They confirmed that all work with live virus had stopped, they confirmed the details of the incident that Merial had reported, and carried out detailed inspection, including of record keeping.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/10">The inspection team judge that while it was possible that live FMD virus had entered the contained drainage system, from their discussions and the evidence gathered they are assured that live virus has not been released to the environment. The extensive layers of biosecurity that we require under the SAPO licence effectively contained the virus in the closed, re-lined drainage system before deactivation in the chemical treatment facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/11">The SAPO licence remains suspended and the inspection team will produce a full report to the acting chief veterinary officer. We will then consider what further action needs to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.142WS.2/12">I will report further to the House in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.144WS.2/1">I have today placed in the library a copy of the report by Mrs. Linda Costelloe Baker, the Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance Refusals with Limited Rights of Appeal, covering the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>. A copy is also being made available on the UKvisas website at: <a href="http://www.ukvisas.co.uk">www.ukvisas.co.uk</a> together with UKvisas' response to the Monitor's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.144WS.2/2">I am most grateful to Mrs. Costelloe Baker for this thorough and positive report based on the 713 sample cases that she has reviewed for the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.144WS.2/3">Mrs. Costelloe Baker commends UKvisas for successfully maintaining a delicate balance between good service and adequate control against a background of major changes in the entry clearance processes&mdash;dedicated application centres, a risk assessment basis for decision making and biometric data capture&mdash;all benefiting the genuine visitor. She goes on to confirm that the overall quality of entry clearance refusal notices is improving.</p>
	<p pid="a.144WS.2/4">Mrs. Costelloe Baker makes a number of constructive recommendations as to how UKvisas can continue to improve the quality of decision making, customer service and complaint handling. UKvisas welcomes these comments and is keen to use these recommendations to drive up the quality of its service to customers whilst maintaining a high level of immigration control.</p>
	<p pid="a.144WS.2/5">I wish to record our thanks to Mrs. Costelloe Baker for the work and effort she has put into producing this her third report as Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance Refusals with Limited Rights of Appeal. The Independent Monitor's next report will cover the period <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September 2007</phrase> and will be published in the first half of 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.145WS.5/1">I am today launching the next stage in the Government's comprehensive programme of reform of Britain's immigration controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/2">Britain's economy and society profit from migration that is effectively managed and controlled. But our system must change if it is to be fit for the future. Over the next 12 months, we will be introducing fundamental changes. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/3" class="indent">The points-based system, which will enable us better to manage economic migration. Our points policy will be advised by a Migration Advisory Committee, which will help us make better informed decisions about the migrants our economy needs, and a Migration Impact Forum, which will help us analyse the wider effects of migration;</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/4" class="indent">A Single Border Force, bringing together the Border and Immigration Agency, Customs and UK Visas. This will provide tougher policing at ports and airports with a highly visible, uniformed presence, counting all migrants in and out of the UK;</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/5" class="indent">The introduction of compulsory identity cards for foreign nationals, helping us to know who is here and what they are entitled to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/6">If we are to stop illegal journeys, however we must stop illegal jobs. Our attack on illegal working therefore attacks the root cause of illegal immigration into Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/7">Following the Prime Minister's announcement on transforming our border strategy last week I am today announcing action on a further three key parts of our strategy on illegal working.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/8">First, I am publishing a Statement of Intent setting out our approach towards licensing employers or colleges wishing to sponsor migrants for visa applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/9">Under the points-based system, employers, and others who benefit from migration and wish to act as sponsors of skilled or temporary migrants, will need a licence to do so. To earn and hold a licence they must agree to fulfil certain duties. Today's Statement of Intent sets out how a would-be sponsor can gain a licence, and what duties we will ask them to perform. We have developed this document working closely with employers' representatives and others to strengthen the Border and Immigration Agency's control of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/10">We are publishing this document today so that those affected can prepare. We are also giving people the opportunity to comment on them. Our proposals may of course change before we finally launch the system. We will give businesses and others the opportunity to apply for sponsorship licences from early 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/11">Secondly, I am publishing today the results of the consultation on the new measures to prevent illegal working in the UK, and the action I now propose to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/12">The consultation set out a new system of civil penalties and a tough new criminal offence for those who knowingly employ illegal workers. As a result I propose that the maximum level of penalty should be &pound;10,000 per illegal worker.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/13">The penalty measures we are introducing will provide a more effective means of encouraging employers to carry out proper checks and of dealing with non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/14">The results report is available on the Border and Immigration Agency website at: <a href="http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk</a> and copies of the report have also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/15">I am also laying revised codes of practice for employers and the necessary regulations to bring sections 15 to 26 of the 2006 Act into force on <phrase class="date" code="">29 February</phrase> next year, including an order for the approval of each House setting the maximum level of civil penalty that may be imposed for employing an illegal worker.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/16">Thirdly, I am taking steps to raise employers' awareness of these changes and to provide support arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/17">Employers will need to know how the changes we are making under the points-based system and the new civil penalty regime will affect recruitment and employment practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/18">National press advertising will commence immediately, to be followed in January with further advertising in the national press, trade press and on national radio, and direct marketing to employers in relevant sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/19">BIA has now enhanced the verification service for employers I announced in May by broadening the range of categories covered by the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.145WS.5/20">Finally, the phased introduction of identity cards for foreign nationals will provide the opportunity to develop employer verification services still further and phase out insecure twentieth century documentation from the checking regime. I will bring forward proposals shortly on the roll-out of mandatory identity cards for foreign nationals.</p>
