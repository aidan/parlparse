	<p>I am announcing that today an Order in Council has been laid to move the date of local elections in Northern Ireland on a permanent basis from the third Wednesday in May to the first Thursday in May. If this measure is accepted by Parliament and the Privy Council it will mean that the Northern Ireland local elections due on Wednesday 18 May 2005 will now take place on Thursday 5 May.</p>
	<p>This measure brings local election dates in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.</p>
	<p>The Government discussed this step in advance with both the Chief Electoral Officer of Northern Ireland and the Electoral Commission.</p>

	<p>A consultative document seeking views on the Government's proposals for implementing the &quot;EU Directive on Takeover Bids&quot; has been published today. Copies are available in the Library and on the DTI website at:</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/current.htm">www.dti.gov.uk/cld/current.htm</a>. The deadline for comments is 15 April.</p>
	<p>The consultative document reflects the Government's view that our existing system of takeover regulation overseen by the takeover panel has many strengths and enjoys the confidence of business. In order to minimise disruption to the current regime, the Government have therefore concluded that the panel should retain responsibility for takeover regulation and that a central objective in implementing the directive should be to build on the strengths of the existing system.</p>
	<p>In order to comply with the requirements of the directive this will require the panel being given powers to make statutory rules while retaining scope to determine its own constitutional and operational framework. The consultative document explains the issues to which this gives rise and how the Government propose to deal with them.</p>
	<p>Primary legislation making the necessary provisions to implement the directive on this basis will be introduced when parliamentary time allows.</p>
