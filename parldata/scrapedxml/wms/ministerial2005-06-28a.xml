	Fishing Industry (Strategy Unit Report)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-28a.53WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="53WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050628/wmstext/50628m01.htm#50628m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/1">I am pleased to announce the publication today of <i>Securing the Benefits,</i> the joint UK response to the March 2004 <i>Net Benefits</i> report from the Prime Minister's strategy unit on the future of the fishing industry in the UK. The latter report was commissioned by the Prime Minister after the state of cod stocks led to the introduction in 2003 of limitations on the time fishing vessels could spend at sea, and in turn to significant decommissioning of UK boats.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/2"><i>Securing the Benefits</i> sets out how the fisheries' administrations in the UK intend to implement the strategy unit's recommendations for the creation of a profitable future for the fishing industry in a thriving marine environment. We have developed this response in close partnership with the fishing industry and other interested groups, and will maintain that partnership as we deliver the actions we have mapped out.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/3">The strategy unit firmly recommended that we should declare a clear aim for the fisheries policy, and <i>Securing the Benefits</i> does this. Our over-arching aim is:</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/4" class="indent">&quot;A fishing sector that is sustainable and profitable and supports strong local communities, managed effectively as an integral part of coherent policies for the marine environment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/5"><i>Securing the Benefits</i> then declares a number of key measures which the administrations are committed to taking forward together at EU, national and regional level, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/6" class="indent">on the common fisheries policy, seeking simpler rules and stronger focus on regional management, and helping members of regional advisory councils to maximise their contribution to the councils' work;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/7" class="indent">making more use of fishermen's information in the assessment of fish stocks;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/8" class="indent">developing on a regional basis a shared understanding with the fishing industry of what is needed to enable the different parts of the fleet to be profitable, considering where relevant the need for further selective decommissioning;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/9" class="indent">improving arrangements for quota management in the UK, for example to provide greater clarity about the ownership of quota. This should help businesses plan for the future;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/10" class="indent">using grants to help the fishing industry apply to the Marine Stewardship Council or other organisations for certification that particular fisheries are sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/11"><i>Securing the Benefits</i> also notes some measures which the individual UK fisheries' administrations will be taking on their own account. The key measures being adopted by Defra in respect of England include:</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/12" class="indent">establishing a Marine Fisheries Agency in October 2005. One early task for the agency will be to pilot the regional fisheries manager concept recommended in <i>Net Benefits</i>;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/13" class="indent">developing provisions in the planned Marine Bill to integrate fisheries into wider marine management, and considering as part of this the potential for a marine agency;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/14" class="indent">continuing the Fisheries Science Partnership, so as to increase co-operation and mutual respect between fishermen and scientists, and the benefits that flow from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/15">Defra will also be publishing its own paper in a few weeks to set out in more detail its plans for taking forward the measures set out in <i>Securing the Benefits</i> as well as other fisheries issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/16">The measures we are announcing will build the economic, social and environmental aims of sustainable development into our approach to fishing. <i>Securing the Benefits</i> sets out a balanced and responsible approach to taking forward the strategy unit's recommendations, and I look forward to working with all concerned to implement it.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.2/17">Copies of the response have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	FCO Response to the Tsunami in the Indian Ocean
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-28a.54WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" speakername="Jack Straw" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs" colnum="54WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050628/wmstext/50628m01.htm#50628m01.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.54WS.2/1">Following the tsunami in the Indian Ocean on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-26">26 December 2004</phrase>, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) launched its largest ever operation to provide consular assistance to British nationals. The FCO provided an immediate and targeted response, with excellent commitment from staff, but given the sheer scale of the incident&mdash;triggered by the second largest earthquake on record&mdash;and the number of countries affected, FCO resources were stretched. In a relatively small number of cases, British nationals did not receive the level of service that we would normally have wished to provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.54WS.2/2">During February and March 2005, the FCO carried out an internal review of our consular response. The emerging findings of this review were published as part of the FCO's memorandum to the Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-09">9 March 2005</phrase>. The Committee made copies of the memorandum available to all Members of Parliament. In the debate following my statement to the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March</phrase> concerning the tsunami, I undertook to make the final conclusions of the internal review known to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.54WS.2/3">The conclusions of the internal review are set out in the form of a short summary of findings and a list of urgent and other recommendations copies of which I have today arranged to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.54WS.2/4">The recommendations are both for the consular directorate in London and for our posts overseas. The purpose of the internal review was to examine the FCO's overall response to the tsunami and identify those areas where better structures, equipment or preparation would have helped us to react more effectively. The review focused on the immediate response to the tsunami and dealt with the work of the FCO only and not of other Government Departments. The National Audit Office is currently examining the overall governmental response to the tsunami crisis, including the role of the FCO, in their review of consular services, due to be published by the end of the year.</p>
