<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-08b.6WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" speakeroffice="The Minister for Competitiveness" colnum="6WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071008/wmstext/71008m0001.htm#0710083000171">
	<p pid="b.6WS.2/1">This year, enterprise week runs from 12 to<phrase class="date" code="2007-11-18">18 November</phrase>. It is the annual focal point of the &quot;Make Your Mark&quot; campaign&mdash;which aims to inspire young people (aged 14-30 years) to be enterprising in the broadest sense, developing a creative, can-do attitude with the skills to spot opportunities and the confidence to pursue them. This is crucial for the future aspirations of millions of young people as well as the economic future of the UK&mdash;encouraging business start-ups, social enterprises and development of an enterprising workforce. <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">Wednesday 14 November</phrase> will be Women's Enterprise Day and <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-15">Thursday 15 November</phrase> will be Social Enterprise Day.</p>
	<p pid="b.6WS.2/2">This is not simply about encouraging business start-ups and entrepreneurship. The campaign also encourages organisations across the UK to take the opportunity of Enterprise Week to celebrate and recognise the wealth of talent that is evident in every business and to encourage their employees to start thinking about ideas that have a very clear and tangible business benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.6WS.2/3">&quot;Make Your Mark&quot; is funded by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and is led by Enterprise Insight&mdash;a campaign coalition founded by the UK's leading business organisations (CBI, British Chambers of Commerce, Institute of Directors, and the Federation of Small Businesses) in partnership with the main enterprise development organisations and working closely with Government Departments, education bodies, Regional Development Agencies and others.</p>
	<p pid="b.6WS.2/4">Last year, Enterprise Week generated very large community interest in entrepreneurship. 448,000 people attended the 3,184 events run by 1,410 organisations. Over 20,000 people in 3,704 teams from schools, colleges and workplaces competed simultaneously around the UK in the Make Your Mark Challenge&mdash;the week's largest single event. Over 15 per cent. of events were in colleges and universities and social enterprise had a particularly high profile, featuring in over 10 per cent. of all events and media coverage.</p>
	<p pid="b.6WS.2/5">Enterprise Week 2007 is expected to be even bigger but it needs members' continued support. Members are urged to look at the campaign website: <a href="http://www.makeyourmark.org.uk">www.makeyourmark.org.uk</a> and consider how the campaign can benefit their constituencies. Active support of Enterprise Week events taking place in constituencies and encouraging the organisations that are running them to register details of their event on the database at: <a href="http://www.enterpriseweek.org">www.enterpriseweek.org</a> will help to ensure that this is the biggest Enterprise Week yet.</p>

	<p pid="b.20WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">12 July</phrase> I announced a review of restraint in juvenile secure settings in the House and, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-26">26 July</phrase>, I set out the broad terms of reference for the review. The Ministry of Justice and the Department for Children, Schools and Families have joint responsibility for the review. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" name="Beverley Hughes">the member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes)</phrase> is the lead Minister for DCSF.</p>
	<p pid="b.20WS.2/2">My right hon. Friend and I are pleased to announce that we have appointed Andrew Williamson CBE and Peter Smallridge CBE as independent joint chairs of the review.</p>
	<p pid="b.20WS.2/3">This is a very important and sensitive review and we warmly welcome the skills and experience that Mr. Williamson and Mr. Smallridge will bring to it. They have strong backgrounds in management in the public sector, having both been Directors of Social Services in large local authorities where they had responsibilities both for services for children and for secure provision. More recently they have been involved in the NHS, where they currently both chair NHS Trusts. They both have considerable experience of participating in and chairing reviews in the NHS and in Social Services. They also have a track record of working together at many levels, including joint working for the Department for International Development in developing child protection services in Eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.20WS.2/4">The chairs will be considering whether any further issues should be brought within the broad terms of reference of the review and will decide soon the process for calling for evidence and for consulting with interested parties. We know that the chairs wish the review to be open and transparent and they are expecting to consult widely.</p>
	<p pid="b.20WS.2/5">My right hon. Friend and I have asked the chairs to report to Ministers within six months of the date of this announcement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-08b.23WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" speakername="Rosie Winterton" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Transport" colnum="23WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071008/wmstext/71008m0004.htm#0710086000115">
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/1">I attended the transport session of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, held in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-02">2 October</phrase>. The Portuguese Minister for Public Works, Transport, and Communications, Mr Mario Lino, was in the chair.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/2">At the June Council, Transport Ministers agreed a Resolution calling on the Commission to submit proposals on ways to take forward the Galileo satellite navigation programme, following acknowledgement by that Council that the PPP process had failed. Accordingly, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-19">19 September</phrase> the Commission issued a Communication dealing with costs, risks, procurement and governance, together with a proposal for amendment of the Galileo financing regulation and provision for funds to be transferred from the margin available under the Agriculture and Administration budget headings, to fund Galileo in the Competitiveness heading (1A).</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/3">With insufficient time for Member States to give detailed consideration to the Communication or to seek the views of national parliaments, discussion on Galileo was confined to an exchange of views. In the exchange, there was wide support for the Galileo project and for reaching an integrated decision by the end of this year. The Council Conclusions reflect these points. In the discussion I made clear the UK's strongly held view that the project should offer value for money for the Community, our opposition to a revision of the financial perspectives, and our firm view that, if the Community decides to proceed with a public procurement of Galileo, any additional funding should be found by reprioritisation within heading 1A.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/4">Following its agreement .in principle in June, the Council adopted a Resolution to establish an EU Regional Data Centre for Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) of ships. This will create a single EU system for ship tracking, in line with the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). A decision was required prior to the participation of EU Member States in the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) meeting, starting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-03">3 October</phrase>. I welcomed the establishment of the data centre, while noting some remaining concerns on system integration and cost-sharing. We also presented these concerns in writing. A UK proposal to set up an ad-hoc working group to address these issues was supported by the Presidency, the Commission, and a number of Member States.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/5">The Council reached a general approach on the draft Directive on road infrastructure safety management. The text of the General Approach is acceptable to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/6">The Council reached a General Approach on each of two proposals on rail interoperability and safety which have been negotiated together. They are a Directive on interoperability of the Community rail system, combining three previous Directives, and a directive amending the 2004 Directive on rail safety. The General Approach texts on these two proposals are acceptable to the UK and successfully deal with our original concerns on establishing a clearer approach as to how the extension to the whole of the Member States rail system will be taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/7">The Presidency and the Commission reported on the outcome of the 36th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in Montreal. The outcome on emissions trading had been disappointing. The Commission wished to examine possible further action, either within ICAO or at the forthcoming UN negotiations in December, and suggested that the Transport Council return to this issue at its November meeting.</p>
