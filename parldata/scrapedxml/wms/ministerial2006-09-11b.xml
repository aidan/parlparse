	<p pid="b.111WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-18">18 July</phrase> in a written ministerial statement I confirmed the details of the force package for the next routine roulement of UK forces in Iraq in November when the lead UK formation, currently 20 Armoured Brigade, will be replaced by 19 Light Brigade. I would now like to confirm some of the details of preparations for this roulement. As for previous roulements, elements of the Theatre Reserve Battalion, currently the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, will be deployed to provide additional security during what is always a period of intense activity for UK forces. There will also be some additional support aimed at contributing to improving security in Basra city.</p>
	<p pid="b.111WS.2/2">In total this involves approximately 360 additional personnel. They will begin deploying shortly and complete their work not later than January 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.111WS.2/3">This is a critical period for the Iraqi people and their Government. There is an opportunity to improve significantly the security situation in Basra city&mdash;building on, and reinforcing, recent progress in Baghdad. Improved security in Basra will create the conditions for the important civil development work being led by the UK's Provincial Reconstruction Team. Therefore I have agreed that the deployment of troops from the Theatre Reserve Battalion, while strictly time limited, should on this occasion be brought forward and extended by a short period. In addition, I have also authorised the deployment of Royal Engineers to assist with reconstruction and countering the threat from improvised explosive devices, a Royal Marine boat troop to assist in tightening security on the Shatt Al Arab waterway, and a troop of Royal Military Police to augment our training of the Iraqi Police.</p>
	<p pid="b.111WS.2/4">We ask our servicemen and women to discharge difficult and dangerous tasks. But over the next few months, through security operations and civil development projects, we have a key opportunity to make improvements to the lives of the people of Basra and lay the foundations for the departure, once the conditions are right, of coalition forces from front line roles in Iraq.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-09-11b.117WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for International Development" colnum="117WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060911/wmstext/60911m0002.htm#0609113000401">
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/1">The recent conflict in Lebanon caused great harm to the civilian populations in both Israel and Lebanon. A million people, a quarter of Lebanon's population, were displaced by the fighting and in Israel 300,000 people were reported to have fled their homes or taken to shelters. Israel had every right to defend itself against Hezbollah, but from the beginning we expressed the need for a proportionate response. I believe that this requires all sides to respect international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/2">The ceasefire, reached after much diplomatic activity, including strenuous efforts by the British Government, is holding and has aided the relief effort but the humanitarian situation in Lebanon remains serious.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-15">15 August</phrase>, the day after the ceasefire came into effect, I visited Beirut to assess the situation for myself. The priorities for the humanitarian aid effort were to secure sustained access for humanitarian convoys to reach the most vulnerable; to ensure safe return for displaced citizens; to minimise the risk of injury and death from unexploded munitions for those returning and for aid workers; and to repair basic infrastructure, such as water and power supplies and bridges.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/4">From early in the conflict, the UK responded to Lebanon's call for help. Our total funding commitment now stands at &pound;22.3 million, including our share of multilateral spending, making us one of the biggest bilateral contributors to the humanitarian effort. In line with our assessment of current priorities, this money is helping to provide shelter, healthcare, water and sanitation, and to clear unexploded munitions. We have agreed to provide urgently needed prefabricated bridges to open critical humanitarian supply routes. The first three bridges arrived in Lebanon on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/5">The Government have also urged Israel to lift all restrictions on normal shipping entering Lebanese ports, as set out in resolution 1701. This is essential in order to help restore the economy. The partial lifting of the economic blockade last week has further enhanced the chances of avoiding a much bigger humanitarian crisis and will help Lebanon begin the path to recovery. We continue to push for further progress on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/6">The international community has responded generously to Prime Minister Siniora's appeal for assistance at the Stockhom conference on early recovery held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-31">31 August</phrase>. Collectively we have pledged over $900 million to aid recovery. It will be important that these pledges are acted on as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/7">Lebanon needed our aid, and we are ready to do more as needed, but more than anything else what Lebanon and the region need is peace. The conflict of this summer was a symptom of a wider collective failure to resolve the conflict that has affected the Middle East for decades. UNSCR 1701 was a step in the right direction, and must be implemented by all parties, but we need to encourage negotiation, compromise and above all political leadership to end the long-term suffering of people on both sides of the border.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/8">Unfortunately, what has happened in Lebanon is not the only humanitarian crisis in the region. We cannot forget the plight of the Palestinians, especially in Gaza, where violence continues and people die. Since the start of the current conflict on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June</phrase>, over 200 Palestinians have been killed and over 700 injured. The cost of damage to agriculture and industry is now estimated at around $46 million. Many households continue to receive only six to eight hours of electricity per day. However, there are plans to rebuild the Gaza power station and to supply electricity from Egypt, which should improve the situation. Intermittent electricity supply is affecting all key services. Water supply and sanitation services remain limited, with severe health implications. The UN now estimates a 65 per cent. increase in the number of children with diarrhoea compared with this time last year. Hospitals are struggling to operate vital equipment and to store drugs and vaccines safely.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/9">Food prices are rising and 70 per cent. of Gazans are now considered to be food insecure. The World Food Programme reports a 72 per cent. increase in numbers using their feeding programme. Gaza crossing points are open intermittently, primarily for humanitarian food supplies. Action is needed to ensure unrestricted humanitarian access, including the supply of medical equipment, fuel, food and electricity.</p>
	<p pid="b.117WS.1/10">At the Stockholm Donor Conference on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September</phrase>, donors pledged $500 million for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, of which $200 million was for humanitarian aid. The UK pledged &pound;3 million to the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) for operation, maintenance and repair work to keep water, sanitation and electricity services running. This follows an earlier contribution to the TIM of &pound;3 million to fund essential health supplies. In addition, the UK made a contribution of &pound;15 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in April. UNRWA provides healthcare and other basic services for Palestinian refugees, who comprise 70 per cent. of Gaza's population. The UK has also deployed two experts to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to improve its capacity to monitor the humanitarian situation in Gaza. These two experts will assist donors and others to make sure help gets to those who need it the most.</p>

	<p pid="b.120WS.1/1">The Government have set Public Service Agreement targets to address geographical inequalities in life expectancy, cancer, heart disease, stroke and related diseases. The targets aim to see faster progress compared to the average in the &quot;fifth of areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators&quot;. Achievement of the targets will be assessed on the outcomes for this group in 2010. The local authorities and primary care trusts which make these areas are the Health Inequalities Spearhead Group.</p>
	<p pid="b.120WS.1/2">The Spearhead group is defined on local authority data and consist of 70 local authorities that are then mapped onto primary care trust boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.120WS.1/3">Revised primary care trusts boundaries were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-19">19 May</phrase>. Following the reconfiguration, the spearhead group list has been refreshed to take account of the new primary care trust boundaries. The list of 70 Spearhead group local authorities (that has not changed) and the revised list of 62 primary care trusts that map to them is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.122WS.2/1">Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>

	<p pid="b.122WS.5/1">I would like to update the House on the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda. On July 24, Pascal Lamy, the Director General of the WTO announced that he was recommending the suspension of the negotiations across all subjects after talks between the US, EU, Brazil, India, Australia and Japan broke down on the key issues of agricultural domestic support, agricultural market access and non-agricultural market access. He said the suspension would give all WTO members time to reflect, to examine available options and to review their positions. His recommendation was accepted at a WTO General Council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-27">27 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.122WS.5/2">The UK Government are very disappointed that insufficient progress has been made in the negotiations to allow the conclusion of the Doha Round this year. While it is very disappointing that no agreement has yet been reached, it is premature to say that the Doha Round has collapsed and cannot be revived. We believe that all key players have a responsibility to use the suspension of the negotiations to reflect on their positions with a view to showing flexibility in future that will allow an agreement to be reached. Developing countries, including the poorest countries, are the biggest losers from the failure to reach agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.122WS.5/3">The UK remains committed to achieving an ambitious, pro-development outcome to these negotiations. Our priority now is to encourage all WTO members to re-engage in the negotiations as soon as possible. The UK Government have taken and will continue to take every opportunity to press for this&mdash;within the EU and with other WTO members. The UK Government will also continue to press for progress on Aid For Trade for developing countries. Building developing countries' capacity to trade is important in helping them integrate into the global economy and for providing a route out of poverty, and we do not believe that Aid for Trade should be conditional on the successful conclusion of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid="b.122WS.5/4">The UK will continue to support a multilateral, rules based international trading system. We believe multilateralism is the best way of tackling unfair trade practices.</p>
