In his statement to the House yesterday, the Prime Minister recognised the hard and dangerous work being undertaken by our armed forces, and reiterated United Kingdom's objectives in Afghanistan. The next roulement of UK forces in Afghanistan will take place in April 2009. The force package that we plan to deploy will see the current lead formation, 3 Commando Brigade, Royal Marines, replaced by 19 (Light) Brigade which will command the majority of the units serving in Afghanistan. The forces deploying include:</p>

	<p pid="c.104WS.1/85">These units represent direct replacements for previously announced deployments to Afghanistan. In addition, commanders on the ground need to retain tactical flexibility to call forward reserves on a temporary basis to meet short term operational needs. Elements of 2nd Battalion, The Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, the Theatre Reserve Battalion, are deployed or are about to be deployed in this capacity. In his statement yesterday the Prime Minister announced the approval until August, including for the period of preparation for the elections, of an increase in the number of British troops deployed to Afghanistan from just over 8,000 to around 8,300. These additional troops will come from 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and will replace equivalent forces deployed from 2nd Battalion, the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment. These forces will be building on recent security gains in central Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="c.104WS.1/86">Volunteer and regular members of the reserve forces will continue to deploy to Afghanistan as part of this integrated force package, and we expect to issue around 600 call-out notices to fill some 575 posts. On completion of their mobilization procedures, the reservists will undertake a period of training and, where applicable, integration with their respective receiving units. The majority will serve on operations for six or so months, although some may have shorter tours. As part of this commitment, we expect up to 15 members of the sponsored reserves to be in theatre at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="c.104WS.1/87">The House will also wish to be aware that 19 Light Brigade's deployment will last until October 2009. On current plans, the brigade will then be replaced by 11 Light Brigade. I shall make a further statement on the units we expect to commit from next October in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.107WS.2/1">The Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, my hon. Friend, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" name="Joan Ruddock">the Member for Lewisham and Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase>, and I attended the 14th conference of the parties (COP14) to the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) and the fourth meeting of the parties to the Kyoto protocol (CMP4) in Poznan, Poland last week.</p>
	<p pid="c.107WS.2/2">The conference reached agreement to accelerate the pace of negotiations next year in order to conclude a new global climate change agreement in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.107WS.2/3">Other key outcomes from the conference included:</p>
	<p pid="c.107WS.2/4" class="indent">A decision to make operational the adaptation fund, which will help developing countries to integrate climate resilience into their development strategies. The UK is providing further financial support to help the fund with its planning and procedures so that it can begin to receive project proposals in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.107WS.2/5" class="indent">Agreement among key developing and developed forestry countries, brokered by the UK, to a framework for countering deforestation, with the UK announcing a contribution of up to &pound;100 million from the environmental transformation fund for capacity-building to help people in forest countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.107WS.2/6">In relation to carbon markets some progress was made on discussions, including carbon capture and storage and forestry within the Kyoto protocol's clean development mechanism (CDM), with parties agreeing that the CDM executive board should assess the implications of the possible inclusion of CCS and forestry in the CDM.</p>
	<p pid="c.107WS.2/7">Useful discussions were also held under the article 9 review of the Kyoto protocol. Parties considered proposals to extend the current CDM 2 per cent. levy, which is used to provide adaptation funding, to the joint implementation and international emissions trading mechanisms. Although no decisions were made, the discussion provided a useful opportunity to discuss aspects of the future financial architecture which will be critical to a Copenhagen deal.</p>
	<p pid="c.107WS.2/8">The Poznan conference represents an important staging post on the way to Copenhagen. The UK and EU played a leading role in the conference, further strengthened by the European Council's agreement to the 2020 climate and energy package. The Government will be working actively over the next 12 months to secure an ambitious global agreement in Copenhagen, consistent with the UK and EU objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.</p>

	<p pid="c.108WS.1/1">My noble Friend Lord Hunt, the Minister for Sustainable Development and Energy Innovation and I, represented the UK at the Environment Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-04">4 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.108WS.1/2">At this Council, member states set out their views on the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control (IPPC) Directive. Several member states raised concerns about the large combustion plant provision with most asking to postpone these provisions until 2020. The UK intervened to welcome the proposal but also to stress some concerns about the large combustion provisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.108WS.1/3">Member states also discussed the action plan for Sustainable Consumption and Production and a Sustainable Industrial Policy (SCP-SIP). The UK intervened to welcome the action plan, in particular the proposal to extend the scope of the eco-design directive but highlighted concerns about the energy labelling directive. Council conclusions were adopted without amendment.</p>
	<p pid="c.108WS.1/4">Council conclusions on the preparation for the 25th session of the UNEP Governing Council were adopted unanimously.</p>
	<p pid="c.108WS.1/5">On genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the UK expressed its support for evidence based, case-by-case decision making and argued strongly against setting seed labelling thresholds at the lowest possible level. Instead these levels should be science based, proportionate and workable in practice. In response to the interventions made by many member states the presidency proposed some changes to the conclusions, including a satisfactory formulation on seed thresholds. These were agreed unanimously.</p>
	<p pid="c.108WS.1/6">Over lunch member states discussed the climate and energy package and preparations for the December European Council.</p>
	<p pid="c.108WS.1/7">There was a discussion of the Council conclusions on deforestation and forest degradation to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss. The UK argued in favour of maintaining the flexibility to recognise afforestation and reforestation credits in order to maintain the confidence of both rainforest countries and potential investors. Following negotiation facilitated by the presidency, a compromise was achieved which both retains the flexibility around recognition of forestry credits for Government compliance and expresses openness to considering their recognition for ETS compliance in the medium to long term and subject to thorough review/experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.108WS.1/8">The proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (CO2 from cars regulation) originally scheduled as a main agenda item&mdash;was not formally discussed at the Council as good progress was being made at discussions at COREPER.</p>
	<p pid="c.108WS.1/9">Under 'any other business', the European Commission presented communications on: the dismantling of ships; the EU strategy on invasive alien species; the EU and the Arctic region; and the implementation of European Community environmental law. Additionally, the European Commission presented a Green Paper on biowaste management in the European Union, the preparations of the EUROMED conference and the EU-Africa Climate Change summit. Finally, the Irish delegation discussed the fall in demand for recycled materials. All AOB items were noted by member states without substantial discussion.</p>

	<p pid="c.109WS.2/1">As a result of the Government's Mental Health Act 2007, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, statutory access to an Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA) will be available to qualifying patients in England under the Mental Health Act 1983. IMHAs will help patients to understand the way the Mental Health Act applies to them, and what can and cannot be done as a result. They will also help patients to understand their rights under the Act, and to support them in exercising those rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.109WS.2/2">At the end of last year, the Department consulted on draft regulations in relation to IMHA services. In doing so, we specifically sought views on who should commission IMHA services locally. It was clear from responses to the public consultation exercise that there were conflicting views on who should commission and provide advocacy services.</p>
	<p pid="c.109WS.2/3">Having carefully considered these responses, the Government have decided that primary care trusts (PCTs) will be responsible for commissioning IMHA services, although to ensure local flexibility, we intend to allow them to exercise their duty with other PCTs and to include commissioning of IMHA services within the scope of partnership arrangements with local social services authorities under section 75 of the National Health Service Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.109WS.2/4">I have laid regulations today to direct PCTs to commission IMHA services and set appointment requirements for IMHAs. Comprehensive commissioning guidance will be published shortly, to assist PCTs in meeting their statutory duty. PCTs' new duty has been reflected in PCT baseline allocations for 2009-10 and 2010-11.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-12-16c.110WS.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" speakername="Bridget Prentice" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice" colnum="110WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm081216/wmstext/81216m0002.htm#08121648000196">
	<p pid="c.110WS.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-28">28 August 2008</phrase>, the Ministry of Justice published its response to its consultation paper, &quot;Administration of Estates - Review of the Statutory Legacy&quot; (CP(R) 11/05) and announced that the levels of the statutory legacy would be increased from &pound;125,000 to &pound;250,000 where the deceased leaves a surviving spouse or civil partner and children and from &pound;200,000 to &pound;450,000 in other cases. The Department also announced that the actuarial tables for converting a surviving spouse's or civil partner's life interest on intestacy into a capital sum were to be updated.</p>
	<p pid="c.110WS.6/2">Subject to parliamentary approval, these changes will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-01">1 February 2009</phrase>. They will be effected by two statutory instruments. The first, the Family Provision (Intestate Succession) Order 2008 will increase the statutory legacy. It was laid in draft on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-12">Wednesday 12 November</phrase>. The second, the Intestate Succession (Interest and Capitalisation) (Amendment) Order 2008 will update the actuarial tables. It was laid on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-11">Thursday 11 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.110WS.6/3">The statutory legacy is the fixed net sum payable to a surviving spouse or civil partner from the estate of a person dying intestate&mdash;without leaving a valid will. If the estate is of sufficient value, the surviving spouse or civil partner is entitled to a life interest in one half of the balance of the remainder once the statutory legacy has been settled. The surviving spouse or civil partner will receive any income generated from the life interest for the rest of his or her life or can choose to convert it into capital. The conversion is calculated by reference to the actuarial tables.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-12-16c.113WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" speakername="Geoff Hoon" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="113WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm081216/wmstext/81216m0002.htm#08121648000199">
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/1">I attended the EU Transport Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-09">9 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/2">The Council discussed the regulation amending the four regulations adopted in 2004 which established the Single European Sky (SES). The amending regulation consolidates and strengthens the earlier regulations, with the aim of improving the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system: Ministers were in agreement on the technical elements of the new proposal. I joined several other Ministers in expressing strong support for the package. It was not however possible for member states to reach a general approach, as an issue regarding applicability of the new legislation to Gibraltar was raised just before the Council. I and the Spanish Minister undertook to resolve this issue bilaterally, so that Council agreement on this important proposal can be achieved soon.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/3">The Council was given a presidency progress report on an amending regulation extending the responsibilities of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Council reached a partial general approach&mdash;on extension of EASA's scope to air traffic management and air navigation services. The progress report also covered the provisions on extension of scope to aerodrome safety matters. The presidency underlined the Agency's important work of inspection and certification in these areas, as an integral part of the Single European Sky package.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/4">The Council adopted two decisions authorising the Commission to open negotiations towards comprehensive aviation agreements with Tunisia and Algeria. The UK supports these mandates.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/5">The presidency and the Commission reported on the successful outcome of negotiations on an EU-Canada aviation agreement. I thanked the Commission for its work on this good agreement, which may be signed during the Czech presidency.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/6">The presidency tabled a report on progress to date in consideration of a proposed Directive to amend Directive 1999-62 on charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructure&mdash;the &quot;Eurovignette&quot; Directive. The proposal aims to provide member states with the flexibility to introduce charges for lorries, to internalise the costs of congestion, noise and air pollution. The presidency noted that considerable progress had been made towards agreement on a number of issues, but further discussion would be needed on questions such as the inclusion of congestion charging, the methodology for calculating the level of external cost charges and the question of hypothecation&mdash; earmarking&mdash;of income from charges. The UK supports the principles underlying the proposal but opposes mandatory hypothecation of revenues. The Czech Republic will aim to reach agreement on this proposal in Council during its presidency.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/7">The presidency gave a progress report on the proposed directive on cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety, noting that there had been a wide consensus on the need to take action in this area and hoping that further progress will be made during the Czech presidency.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/8">The Council adopted conclusions on the greening of transport, the Commission's strategy for the internalisation of external costs in transport and the reduction of rail noise on existing rolling stock. The UK supported the conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/9">The Council adopted a resolution on the establishment of a European regional data centre for the Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) of ships. This is the implementation in Europe of a Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulation adopted by the IMO in 2006. The resolution is acceptable to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.113WS.1/10">Adopted by the Council without debate&mdash;as &quot;A points&quot;&mdash;were common positions on proposals on flag state requirements and the civil liability of shipowners, both of which are part of the third maritime legislative package. The other six proposals in the package had already been adopted by the Council, and the presidency announced agreement on those between the Council and the European Parliament in the Conciliation Committee the previous day.</p>
