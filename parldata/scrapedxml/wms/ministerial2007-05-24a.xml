	<p pid="a.85WS.7/1">Seizing criminal assets delivers a wide range of benefits, from depriving criminals of capital to reducing the incentives for crime and the harm caused by crime, as well as promoting fairness and confidence in the criminal justice system. In 2006-07 the total amount recouped by all agencies involved in asset recovery in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was &pound;125 million. This is a five-fold increase over five years. We want to build on this success. The Government are therefore publishing today an Asset Recovery Action Plan. The Action Plan has two purposes. Firstly it sets out robust proposals on how we are to reach our challenging target of recovering &pound;250 million of the proceeds of crime by 2009-10. The Plan goes on to outline, for consultation, policy proposals for taking things further, including some radical ideas to move towards the Government's long term vision of detecting up to &pound;1 billion of criminal assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.7/2">The consultation period will end on <phrase class="date" code="">23 November 2007</phrase>. A copy of the Action Plan is being placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.86WS.1/1">I am today informing Parliament of an ongoing police operation to locate three British citizens who are believed to have absconded from Control Orders on Monday night.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/2">It is believed that these individuals wanted to travel abroad for terrorism-related purposes. They are not considered at this time to represent a direct threat to the public in the UK. The control orders were therefore designed to prevent travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/3">Their control orders included obligations requiring them to surrender any travel documents and report each day to a local police station, and two of the individuals were required to phone a monitoring company each night. On the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May</phrase>, these two individuals failed to call the monitoring company. All three individuals failed to report to their local police station on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/4">Public safety is the top priority for the Government and the police. Locating these individuals is an operational matter for the police, and an active investigation is underway. On police operational advice, and to assist the investigation, I approached the High Court to lift the anonymity orders for these three individuals and this was agreed late yesterday afternoon. As a result, the police were able to make a public appeal as part of their ongoing investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/5">As I have consistently made clear, control orders are far from 100 per cent. effective, but under our existing laws they are as far as we can go.</p>
	<p pid="a.86WS.1/6">Unfortunately, within these limits, it is very difficult to prevent determined individuals from absconding. Nevertheless, I am already appealing to the House of Lords in several other control order cases about the interpretation of Article 5 ECHR (deprivation of liberty). We will consider other options&mdash;including derogation&mdash;if we have exhausted ways of overturning previous judgements on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.90WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-26">26 February 2007</phrase>, I issued an intervention notice under section 42(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 in respect of British Sky Broadcasting Group's acquisition of a 17.9 per cent. stake in ITV plc. This meant that, in accordance with sections 44 and 44A of the Enterprise Act, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-27">27 April</phrase> I received reports from the Office of Fair Trading on the competition effects of the transaction and from Ofcom on the effects of the transaction on the public interest consideration specified in the intervention notice. I am now required to take a decision under section 45 of the Enterprise Act on whether to refer the transaction to the Competition Commission for fuller investigation. I have decided to refer the transaction to the Competition Commission under section 45(2) of the Enterprise Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/2">In reaching this decision I have had regard to the provisions of the relevant legislation and have given careful consideration to the reports I received from the Office of Fair Trading and Ofcom, including the summaries of the submissions made by the parties and by third parties that are contained in those reports. I have also considered carefully the additional representations my Department subsequently received from British Sky Broadcasting and have obtained advice from Ofcom under section 106B of the Enterprise Act on questions raised in those additional representations. In accordance with section 106B(3) of the Enterprise Act, Ofcom will publish this further advice to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/3">The Office of Fair Trading's report includes their decisions that:</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/4" class="indent">(i) it is or may be the case that a relevant merger situation has been created as a result of British Sky Broadcasting Group's acquisition of shares in ITV plc;</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/5" class="indent">(ii) the creation of that merger situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition such that further investigation by the Competition Commission is warranted; and</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/6" class="indent">(iii) it is not appropriate to deal with the matter by way of undertakings in lieu of a reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/7">I am bound by the Enterprise Act to accept these decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/8">The report from Ofcom includes their conclusion that, as a result of the relevant merger situation, there may not be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving the UK cross-media audience for national news and the UK TV audience for national news. They advise that this may be expected to operate against the public interest and that a fuller investigation of the matter by the Competition Commission is warranted. In accordance with sections 107(3)(b) and (ba) and 107(9)(a) of the Act, I am today publishing the reports I received from the Office of Fair Trading and Ofcom.</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/9">I consider the statutory thresholds for making a reference provided in section 45(2) of the Enterprise Act are met in this case in that I believe that it is or may be the case that:</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/10" class="indent">(i) a relevant merger situation has been created;</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/11" class="indent">(ii) the creation of that situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition;</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/12" class="indent">(iii) the public interest consideration mentioned in the intervention notice is relevant; and</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/13" class="indent">(iv) taking account only of the substantial lessening of competition and the relevant public interest consideration, the creation of the situation operates or may be expected to operate against the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.90WS.2/14">This decision to make a reference under section 45(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 means the Competition Commission will, in accordance with section 47(2) of that Act, decide whether a relevant merger situation has been created, whether the creation of that situation has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition and whether, taking account of the specified public interest consideration concerned, the situation operates or may be expected to operate against the public interest. Detailed investigation by the Competition Commission means the effect of the transaction on competition and media plurality will be examined in depth enabling substantive conclusions to be reached on the basis of all the relevant arguments and facts. Under section 51 of the Enterprise Act, the Competition Commission is required to provide a report to me within 24 weeks of the date of the reference, although it may extend this deadline by up to eight weeks if there are special reasons why this is necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.91WS.1/1">The following statement provides information on the Competitiveness Council in Brussels on 21 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May 2007</phrase>, at which I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/2" class="italic">Day 1 <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">Monday 21 May</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/3">The Council opened with a progress report on better regulation under the German Presidency. There were also Progress Reports from the Presidency on the Mutual Recognition (Goods) Regulation and on a Common Framework for the marketing of products (The New Approach). The Council noted progress on these dossiers without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/4">Council Conclusions on Industrial Policy were adopted. The main debate revolved around sectoral issues. Compromise wording regarding the financing of ship building was agreed. Text was also agreed on plans to reduce CO2 emissions from cars, where Member states called on the Commission to carry out a full impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/5">At the request of several Member States, the Commission then presented its Consumer Policy Strategy which was published earlier this year. Member States did not intervene. A Council resolution is expected to be agreed at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council on <phrase class="date" code="">30 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/6">The next item on the agenda was the Consumer Credit Directive on which political agreement was reached. Discussion centered on the optional threshold below which those repaying a loan early should not have to pay compensation to lenders for the loss of agreed interest. Eventually, Member States agreed to a compromise level of 10,000 Euros, thus enabling Political Agreement on a Common Position to be reached. The Netherlands and Greece voted against, and Belgium and Luxembourg abstained. I intervened to enter a minutes statement regretting the failure to carry out an impact assessment on this proposal and stressing that it should not set a precedent for other work in the field of financial services.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/7" class="italic">Day 2 <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">Tuesday 22 May</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/8">The second day was devoted to Research and Space business.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/9">The fourth meeting of the &quot;Space Council&quot; was held between the Competitiveness Council and the Council of the European Space Agency (ESA). I, along with a number of Space Ministers, made brief statements about the importance of a European Space Policy (ESP). The Council Resolution on European Space Policy was unanimously adopted after Ministers' interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/10">Under the research items, the Presidency reported on progress on negotiations on the European Institute of Technology on which I, and other Member States, noted a number of outstanding issues which needed to be resolved, notably concerning financing.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/11">The Commission presented its first two proposals for Council regulations to establish Joint Technology Initiatives, one on innovative medicines and the other on embedded computing systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/12">A discussion took place on the European Research Area Green Paper, following the exchange at the informal meeting in W&uuml;rzburg in May. Member States emphasised the importance of the debate and welcomed the Commission's consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/13">Linked to this discussion, Council Conclusions were adopted on research infrastructures, inviting Member States to take forward the work of the European Strategic Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/14">Items covering other business were taken over the two days.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/15">Luxembourg raised concerns about the impact of the proposal for a Regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome 1), I, supported by a number of other Member States, echoed Luxembourg's concerns about its potential impact on the single market and regretted the lack of an impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/16">In addition, the Council noted, without debate, information provided by the Presidency on the following items:</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/17" class="indent">the outcome of the W&uuml;rzburg informal Competitiveness Council on &quot;The Internal Market in Global Competition&quot;;</p>

	<p pid="a.91WS.1/20" class="indent">the proposal for a directive laying down rules on nominal quantities for pre- packed products;</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/21" class="indent">the European Conference &quot;Innovation and Market Access through Standardisation&quot; (Berlin, 26- <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-27">27 March 2007</phrase>);</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/22" class="indent">the 4th European Conference on Craft Industries (Stuttgart, 16-<phrase class="date" code="2007-04-17">17 April 2007</phrase>) (9095/07);</p>

	<p pid="a.91WS.1/26">The Council noted the information provided by the Commission concerning the Regulation on a globally harmonised system of classification and labelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/27">The Council also noted information from the Commission regarding forthcoming proposals to establish joint national research programmes under Article 169 of the Treaty, to be presented during 2007 and 2008.</p>
