<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-06-29a.34WS.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" speakername="Greg Clark" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government" colnum="34WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100629/wmstext/100629m0001.htm#10062944000121">
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/1">Infrastructure is vital to the health and well-being of our nation. It is the backbone of our economy and its proper maintenance and renewal is critical for growth. We need to generate power and deliver it to our homes and businesses. We need ports to import and export goods and modern transport infrastructure to sustain a dynamic and entrepreneurial economy and to improve our quality of life. Without new infrastructure networks we risk the economic recovery of the nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/2">Because decisions on new major infrastructure are so important and affect so many people we will be making a number of changes to the way in which policy is established, applications are handled and decisions taken. We will include the necessary measures within primary legislation to be brought forward in the current session of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/3" class="italic">Abolition of the Infrastructure Planning Commission</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/4">The Government want a planning system for major infrastructure which is rapid, predictable and accountable. But we do not believe it is right that decisions on major infrastructure applications be taken by an unelected quango. They should be made by Ministers. We will therefore be abolishing the unelected Infrastructure Planning Commission and reintroducing democratic accountability in line with the coalition agreement:</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/5" class="indent">&quot;We will abolish the unelected Infrastructure Planning Commission and replace it with an efficient and democratically accountable system that provides a fast-track process for major infrastructure projects.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/6">Our intention is therefore to establish a Major Infrastructure Planning Unit as part of the Planning Inspectorate-an existing agency of Communities and Local Government-which will retain the strengths of the streamlined processes and the experience of the Planning Inspectorate. The Government will put these changes into effect as soon as possible. In the interim, we have asked the Infrastructure Planning Commission and the Planning Inspectorate to consider now how they can work together and identify efficiency savings. Further transitional arrangements are set out below.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/7" class="italic">National Policy Statements</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/8">We are committed to openness and transparency and it follows that planning decisions should be taken within a clear policy framework, and within clear time limits, making these decisions as predictable as possible. The Government will therefore be pressing ahead with the development of national policy statements and will issue a more detailed statement on them later in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/9">The Government also want to ensure that national policy statements, and the decisions that will be based upon them, are as robust as possible, thus minimising the risk of successful judicial review, particularly by those wishing to abuse the system. We believe therefore that the decision-making framework for major infrastructure should have the strongest possible democratic legitimacy. That is why we will be ensuring that national policy statements are ratified by Parliament. National policy statements are critically important documents and they should be subject to public consultation with appropriate local and community engagement, and both scrutinised and ratified by Parliament before designation.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/10" class="italic">Transitional arrangements</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/11">Until new legislation is in place the Infrastructure Planning Commission will continue in its present role until it is abolished. During this interim period, should an application reach decision-stage and where the relevant national policy statement has been designated, the Infrastructure Planning Commission will decide the application. If an application reaches decision stage and the relevant national policy statement has not been designated, the Infrastructure Planning Commission will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State, who will take the decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/12">For those applications under active consideration by the Infrastructure Planning Commission when it is abolished, transitional provisions will enable the examination of such applications to continue without interruption, through a seamless transfer to the new Major Infrastructure Planning Unit. There is no question of applications having to restart the process and we intend that the statutory timetable for decision-taking will be no longer than the current regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.7/13">The Government want to have national policy statements in place as rapidly as possible. In particular, we intend to complete the process for making the energy (including nuclear) national policy statements, which are part-way through the scrutiny process, and will bring forward revised final texts and ask Parliament to ratify them. We are still considering how best to take forward the remaining national policy statements under development, and will be publishing a more detailed implementation plan -including transitional arrangements and a revised timetable-later in the summer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-06-29a.36WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40391" speakername="Caroline Spelman" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="36WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100629/wmstext/100629m0001.htm#10062944000122">
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/1">The delivery of public services is at the heart of DEFRA'S role. From flood defences to animal health, from making payments to farmers to conserving biodiversity, DEFRA protects our natural environment, supports British food and farming industries and promotes the green economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/2">But DEFRA has a very big network, with over 80 arm's-length bodies. In my first month, I have made it my priority to examine the network critically. In line with the coalition Government's commitments, I am applying the &quot;three Government tests&quot; to each of our bodies: Does it perform a technical function? Does it need to be politically impartial? Does it act independently to establish facts?</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/3">I am announcing today the first results of this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/4">The Government are committed to improving the quality of life for those living and working in rural areas and intend to put the fair treatment of rural communities at the centre of Government. Ministers will lead rural policy from within my Department; I have decided accordingly to abolish the Commission for Rural Communities as an independent body.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/5">The Commission for Rural Communities (CRC) is a DEFRA-funded non-departmental public body that was established under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/6">The Government believe policy advice should be carried out by Departments, not arm's-length bodies. DEFRA will, therefore, reinforce its capacity to undertake rural work within the Department: a strengthened Rural Communities Policy Unit will work across Government to ensure that the interests of rural communities are fully reflected in policies and programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/7">In taking this action, I pay tribute to the commitment and quality of work undertaken by the Commission for Rural Communities, its staff, commissioners and its chairman, the Rev. Dr Stuart Burgess CBE, over the past four years. My Department will continue to work closely with the CRC during the transition to the new arrangements so that we build on its achievements.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/8">The Animal Health Agency and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, are the two principal DEFRA executive agencies which work to combat animal diseases. I intend to merge these two agencies. This will allow us to bring together services, expertise and scientific capability on animal health. It will improve our resilience in delivering important services, including our animal disease emergency response capability and science requirements for animal health. In resource-constrained times, the merger will enable the agencies to create more efficient ways of working, reduce the cost and bureaucracy needed to manage the interfaces between these agencies, DEFRA and the devolved administrations, and their customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/9">The merger of the executive agencies will go ahead shortly, with as little disruption to staff and customers as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/10">A single chief executive will be appointed for the new agency this summer, and will be tasked with working out how to achieve the full integration of the agencies, including structures and ways of working, by the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/11">In the meantime, both agencies will continue to be led by their chief executives and senior teams. In implementing this change to our arm's-length bodies, the Department will work closely with the Responsibility and Cost Sharing Advisory Group, as well as devolved administrations and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/12">Following the principle that Government should do only those things which only Government can do, we are examining how parts of the DEFRA network's assets could be marketed or be run better through the voluntary sector, while protecting key DEFRA outcomes. Further announcements will follow, against the principles outlined above.</p>

	<p pid="a.37WS.2/1">The House is aware that I have been conducting a full review of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's spending on programmes. I refer to the reply given by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-07">7 June 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-06-07.24"><i>Official Report</i>, Column 24W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/2">My aim was threefold: to ensure that FCO programmes deliver the priorities of the new Government; to ensure that they focus on those areas where the FCO itself can make the biggest difference and offer the best possible value for money; and to establish where the FCO can make cuts as part of its contribution to the reduction in public expenditure to which this Government are committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/3">I have decided that we will:</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/4" class="indent">Sustain planned spending this financial year on our counter-terrorism and Afghan counter-narcotics programmes, which contribute to some of the UK's most important priorities, and will seek (resources permitting) to maintain FCO programme funding on these issues in future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/5" class="indent">Sustain planned spending this financial year on our bilateral programme funds, which enhance our relationships and influence with key countries around the world, and will seek (resources permitting) to increase this funding in future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/6" class="indent">Maintain a substantial programme of scholarships to bring future decision-takers and opinion-formers to the UK, while professionalising our current arrangements and targeting them on a smaller group of people. We will cut this year's programme by &#163;10 million and seek (resources permitting) to sustain a smaller and more strategic programme in future years. I believe this programme should also attract some further external funding, which will now be explored.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/7" class="indent">Sustain in future years (resources permitting) the FCO's programme spending in support of the overseas territories, while making a cut of 10% (&#163;630,000) in spending this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/8" class="indent">Sustain in future years (resources permitting) the FCO's programme spending in support of counter-proliferation, while making a cut of 10% (&#163;300,000) in spending this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/9" class="indent">Sustain in future years (resources permitting) the FCO's programmes on human rights and democracy, reuniting europe, and in support of the Westminster Foundation For Democracy, while making cuts to these programmes this financial year of 10% each (cuts of &#163;560,000; &#163;380,000; and &#163;380,000 respectively).</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/10" class="indent">Cut the FCO's spending on its low-carbon high-growth programme by around &#163;3 million this financial year and explore alternative sources of funding for the programme for future years. This does not mean the FCO is ending work on these issues: our diplomats will remain fully engaged in the UK's international efforts to promote a low-carbon high-growth economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/11" class="indent">Cut the FCO's programme spending on drugs and crime by &#163;l million this financial year, end FCO funding in future years, and explore alternative sources of funding for this programme. This does not mean the FCO is ending work on these issues: our diplomats will remain fully engaged in the UK's international efforts to fight drugs and crime which threaten our shores.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/12" class="indent">Cut our public diplomacy programmes by &#163;1.6 million this financial year, focusing on strategic communications to key overseas audiences, while seeking (resources permitting) to sustain this programme in future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/13" class="indent">Make some adjustments to FCO programme spending on international institutions, cutting &#163;250,000 this financial year, while seeking (resources permitting) to sustain essential support to those institutions in future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/14">These decisions will deliver over &#163;18 million of savings this financial year out of total FCO programme spend of some &#163;140 million. The money saved will help sustain the UK's front-line diplomatic work and our global network of posts, and contribute to the FCO's &#163;55 million in-year cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.37WS.2/15">This is only a small part of the work I am leading to ensure that the FCO delivers the best possible service to the UK taxpayer at the lowest possible cost, and contributes to the Government's goal of reducing the budget deficit. Where there is scope for further cuts, efficiencies and reforms to deliver better for Britain we will make them.</p>
