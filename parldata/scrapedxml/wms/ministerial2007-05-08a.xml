	<p pid="a.2WS.1/1">Following the St Andrews Agreement in October 2006 and the historic agreement by the political parties on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-26">26 March 2007</phrase> to the returnof devolution, I am today setting out how the Government are meeting their commitment underthe St Andrews Agreement to provide the incoming Northern Ireland Executive with a package to create long term economic and financial stability for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/2">The return of devolution today provides a unique opportunity to create long-term peace and prosperity for all the people of Northern Ireland. The Government remain committed to ensuring the incoming Executive has the capacity to provide quality public services, to continue the process of necessary reform, to plan for the future, to make the long-term capital investments to underpin the economic transformation of Northern Ireland, as well as bringing long-term benefits for the island as a whole. In advance of restoration and to this end, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I have had meetings with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister designate. I look forward to continued dialogue with the restored Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/3">In advance of the final outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review, I am today however confirming the following guaranteed package to boost investment, competitiveness and employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/4" class="italic">Investment</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/5">I am today confirming a funding package of at least &pound;51.5 billion comprising:</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/6" class="indent">&pound;35 billion based on existing spending for 2007-08 together with uprating by at least inflation over the next three years;</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/7" class="indent">an &pound;18 billion long term investment strategy from 2005 to 2017;</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/8" class="indent">retention of value for money savings to be made over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11 expected to be at least &pound;0.8 billion;</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/9" class="indent">retention of asset sales to fund capital investment expected to be over &pound;1 billion, with &pound;500 million over the next four years;</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/10" class="indent">additional spending over the next two years under the end-year flexibility scheme of &pound;140 million resource DEL (&pound;75 million in 2007-08 and &pound;65 million in 2008-09) and&pound;180 million capital DEL (&pound;100 million in 2007-08 and&pound;80 million in 2008-09);</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/11" class="indent">additional spending financed by EU receipts expected to be in excess of &pound;0.5 billion;</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/12" class="indent">the provision of &pound;400 million, additional to the &pound;35 billion above, including an upfront &pound;100 million in 2007-08 from the Treasury's Reserve to enable an incoming administration to delay the introduction of water charges without affecting existing spending plans in Northern Ireland and introduce an innovation fund; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/13" class="indent">confirmation of &pound;200 million borrowing under the Reinvestment and Reform initiative from 2007-08. Borrowing under the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative will no longer be linked with the requirement to close the gap with GB council tax rates. This is in addition to the cap on rates and enhanced relief for pensioners already announced by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/14">In addition there will be a major package of integrated investment in infrastructure, including for a substantial new roads programme. In addition to the &pound;18 billion allocated to the revised Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland, the Irish Government havemade &pound;400 million available for the investment in infrastructure projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/15">Within this package, I recognise the need to provide resource this financial year and therefore there willbe &pound;700 million available in 2007-08 above existing Departmental Expenditure Limit plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/16" class="italic">Improving competitiveness</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/17">Following representations from all the political parties on differential tax rates, I announced on<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-22">22 March</phrase> a review led by Sir David Varney to report on how current and future tax policy, and including the tax changes announced in the Budget, can support sustainable growth of businesses and long-term investment in Northern Ireland. The review will consider this in the context of the tax environment across the EU, including the Republic of Ireland.Sir David will report in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/18">A new Northern Ireland corporate tax office is being established to promote the competitive tax position that Northern Ireland enjoys, working closely with Invest Northern Ireland to promote indigenous and inward investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/19">Provision is being made available to facilitate thenew Executive to create an innovation fund focusing particularly on levering in private sector investment and promoting collaborative research. Upfront funding from within &pound;100 million in 2007-08 is being made available along with funding of &pound;36 million from the Irish Government targeted specifically on collaborative research and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/20">I also agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-22">22 March</phrase> to further discussions between an incoming Executive and officials of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) with regard to excise duties and measures to tackle fraud in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/21">To enhance Northern Ireland's competitive positioning in the global economy and, in particular, its ability to attract foreign direct investment, we will work with the Executive to organise a major conferencein Northern Ireland for prospective investors in the autumn with a follow up meeting in America next spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/22" class="italic">Increasing employment opportunities</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/23">In 2006 the unemployment rate in Northern Ireland was 4.2 per cent. compared to 8.9 per cent. in 1997. To build further on this progress, I also announced a new local employment partnership that will help create 5,000 jobs for the unemployed in Northern Ireland. It will be established between five leading employers in the retail sector&mdash;Asda, B&amp;Q, Marks and Spencer, Sainsburys and Tesco&mdash;along with the British Retail Consortiumand the Employment Service in Northern Irelandto support long-term benefit claimants into work, building on the successful approaches these retailers have already established.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/24">Work will also take place in discussion with the construction industry on the development of a similar partnership, and extending this to the hospitality and hotel sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/25" class="italic">Future partnership</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.1/26">Looking ahead and building on this uniquepackage, the Government look forward to continuing engagement between the Treasury and the incoming administration, working in partnership to create a dynamic Northern Ireland economy and world class public services for all in Northern Ireland and, together with the Irish Government, to create a strong all of Ireland economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.4WS.2/1">In April, the Government issued the Local Authorities (Model Code of Conduct) Order 2007, promulgating a simpler, clearer and more proportionate model code of conduct for local councillors. The Order came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/2">The revised code delivers the promise we gavein the Local Government White Paper, &quot;Strong and Prosperous Communities&quot;, last October, that the Government would provide a simpler, clearer and more proportionate code of conduct for local authority members and amend the rules on personal and prejudicial interest to support members' advocacy role.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/3">These changes to the code remove the barriers, which have prevented councillors speaking up for their constituents. In particular, for example, members of a council's planning or licensing committee will have more opportunities to represent their constituents on planning and licensing issues that affect their wards. The changes also ensure that the remit of the code in respect of conduct in a member's private capacity is restricted to conduct for which a criminal conviction has been received.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/4">We have also, in particular, had regard to the over 900 responses we received to our recent consultation on the proposed changes to the code and amended thetext of the code to improve its accessibility and user friendliness. We believe that overall the new revised code will help to maintain public confidence and trust in local government, which is necessary if councils are to fulfil their leadership role.</p>
	<p pid="a.4WS.2/5">Copies of the order have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and circulated to local authorities and other stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.5WS.2/2">The initial move has been successfully completedon time in April 2006 and around 90 communications personnel from RAF High Wycombe are on schedule to move this year. However, there will now be a phased relocation of communications personnel from RAF Brize Norton to RAF Leeming beginning in summer 2008 as technical and domestic accommodation becomes available. The delay in provision of new-build accommodation has been occasioned by the routine adjustment of funds to ensure that our resources are allocated in line with Defence priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.5WS.4/1">Today, I am announcing that the MOD, in association with Sterling Life, has launched a new voluntary life insurance scheme, Service Life Insurance (SLI). In the run-up to Operation TELIC, life insurance companies reacted to what they saw as the increased risk to Service personnel by closing schemes to new applicants, increasing premiums or excluding benefits for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. The Department has been actively pursuing an enduring solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.4/2">MOD selected Sterling Life through an EU-wide competitive tender process to provide appropriate life insurance for which applications will be accepted from today. SLI guarantees worldwide war and terrorism life cover to all Service personnel, by means of a unique partnering agreement between MOD and Sterling Life. The SLI Scheme is designed to be self-funding, andthe Department has accepted a potential liability which received Parliamentary approval in May 2005, for excessive operational deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.4/3">The SLI Scheme complements the excellent death-in-service arrangements already available to Service personnel and offers an attractive addition for long-term life insurance requirements for members of our Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.4/4">SLI premiums are extremely competitive, particularly for those individuals whose military trade usually results in an additional premium being applied. SLI has no extra premiums for any military trade, even such as being a member of a bomb disposal or special forces unit. It will accept all Regulars and Reservists&mdash; even if they are on operations or under orders to deploy. Applicants will be accepted without any medical underwriting and SLI will cover all service-recognised hazardous sports. Premium rates are guaranteed not to increase for the life of the policy. These are significant new SLI benefits from Sterling Life.</p>
	<p pid="a.5WS.4/5">I am delighted to announce the launch today ofthis Service Life Insurance Scheme which providesa ground-breaking new choice for all Regulars and Reservists. I am confident that through our agreement with Sterling Life we have today provided a world-class solution to a worldwide problem. I will arrange for copies of the SLI brochure, which gives furtherdetails of the Scheme, to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.6WS.2/1">In November 2005, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Fiona Mactaggart announced the National Offender Management Service Young Adult Offenders (YAOs) Project, as part of the new approach to offender management, to consider the implications of abolishing DYOI and the regime that would need to be in place to ensure sufficient safeguards for this age group both in custody and the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/2">The project has reviewed the needs of YAOs , the appropriate age range, the use of the prison estate,the regimes and interventions required in prison andin the community and considered the implications of abolishing Detention in a Young Offender Institution (DYOI).</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/3">There has been full consultation with internal and external stakeholders. Significant representatives of voluntary and community groups have been consulted in particular Barrow Cadbury, Prison Reform Trust, NACRO and Rainer. Consideration has been given to HM Inspectorate's recent thematic report on young adult offenders. Future implementation will include consideration of Baroness Corston's recommendations regarding women offenders in the Criminal Justice System.</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/4">We have concluded that taking account of the constraints posed by current prison capacity and the need to undertake further work to test out an approach to Young Adult Offenders the time is not yet right to abolish Detention in a Young Offender Institution (DYOI).</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/5">However, we are firmly committed to further work to ensure we plan for appropriate provision to address the specific needs of 18 to 24-year olds. We will progressa suite of proposals to enable us to test the best approaches both in custody and in the community by:</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/6" class="indent">Piloting a specification for a new regime for this age groupas an integral part of the new prison capacity building arrangements;</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/7" class="indent">Setting up a test/pilot to consider the specification and funding required to take this 'through the gate' for YAOs subject to the requirement for section 65 supervision;</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/8" class="indent">Establishing a demonstrator project to explore the management of this age group in the community in Wales. Particularly to take a hard look at a focused use of mentoring and wraparound services.</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/9" class="indent">Regional Offender Managers agreeing key priorities for this age group in 2008-09 and in the medium to longer term NOMS will consider developing a specification for this age group to be delivered by providers;</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/10" class="indent">Incorporating an adolescent development package into the Offender Manager training at the next review;</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/11" class="indent">Implementing recommended actions arising from the Mubarek recommendations 16 and 17 as an integral part of future YAO policy;</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.2/12" class="indent">Ensuring projects for offenders serving under 12 months in custody specifically include the needs of this age group especially those subject to Section 65 requirement of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for supervision; with the Reconnect project exploring the nature, impact and cost of mentoring, needs assessments and work plans/compacts;</p>

	<p pid="a.7WS.2/1">An informal meeting of the EU Competitiveness Council took place in Wuerzburg in Germany from 26-<phrase class="date" code="2007-04-28">28 April</phrase>. The Council was split into two halves. Part I dealt with Science and Research. Part II dealt with Economic issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/2" class="italic">Part I Science and Research</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/3">Malcolm Wicks represented the UK at Part I of the Council. The Council was chaired by Annette Schavan, German Federal Minister for Education and Research.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/4">Under the first item, research Ministers debated the recent Commission Green Paper on the European Research Area. Along with other Ministers, Malcolm Wicks emphasised the importance of this debateon fostering the free movement of knowledge and overcoming fragmentation in Europe, and stressedthe need to include consideration of subsidiarity and European added value.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/5">Under the second item there was a discussion of the proposed European Institute of Technology, where Malcolm Wicks and other Ministers welcomed progress made in negotiations under the German presidency while noting outstanding financial and governance issues to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/6">In the final item, the German presidency presenteda proposal for an IPR charter following a recent Commission communication on knowledge transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/7" class="italic">Part II Economics issues</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/8">I represented the UK at Part II of the Council. The Council was chaired by Michael Glos, German Federal Minister for Economics and Technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/9">Under the first item, Ministers discussed Europe's single market and global competition. In particular they focused on factors affecting the attractiveness of the EU as an investment location, noting that the Ernst and Young European Attractiveness Survey confirms that the EU remains the most attractive region in the world for more than 50 per cent. of the companies surveyed. In my intervention I emphasised the economic factors which had made the UK a highly attractive investment location.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.2/10">As a second item, Ministers discussed the role of EU state aid in influencing foreign direct investment in the EU. Ministers noted that the Ernst and Young Survey recorded that only a relatively small proportion of companies considered state aid was a significant factor in their investment decisions. Commissioner Kroes, myself and a majority of other Ministers who spoke intervened to oppose a Presidency suggestion that consideration be given to relaxing EU state aid rules in order to match aid offered by third countries, arguing that this would distort competition and risk WTO litigation.</p>

Richard Steele was named as a person who had been convicted of such an offence. The record should show that whilst criminal proceedings were brought against Richard Steele for insider trading, namely an offence contrary to Section 52 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993, he was not convicted of that (or any other) offence. The record should also therefore show that from 1997 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February 2006</phrase> proceedings were brought against 15 individuals, of which eight were successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.8WS.4/1">The Department for Transport has today published the South West Regional Planning Assessment for the railway (RPAs), the latest in the series of eleven RPAs covering England and Wales. Copies of the document have been placed in both Libraries of the House today and can also be downloaded from the Department's website <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">http://www.dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.4/2">The South West RPA covers the entire South Westof England region including Bristol, Plymouth, Bournemouth/Poole, Exeter and Swindon.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.4/3">RPAs provide the link between regional spatial planning (including preparation of regional transport strategies) and planning for the railway by both Government and the rail industry, and are designed to inform the development of the Government's strategy for the railway. They look at the challenges and options for development of the railway over the next 20 years, in the wider context of forecast change in population, the economy and travel behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.4/4">An RPA does not commit the Government to specific proposals. Instead it sets out the Government' s current thinking on how the railway might best be developed to allow wider planning objectives for a region to be met, and identifies the priorities for further development work.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.4/5">It is the Government's intention to publish theremaining RPAs covering the Thames Valley, East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, and Wales laterthis year.</p>
