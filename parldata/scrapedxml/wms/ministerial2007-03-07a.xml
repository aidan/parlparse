<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-07a.127WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government" colnum="127WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/wmstext/70307m0001.htm#070307108000225">
	<p pid="a.127WS.2/1">Today, I am pleased to announce that following an open competition and an extensive evaluation process undertaken by Communities and Local Government, members of the fire and rescue service, LGA and CFOA, Thales UK/EADS Defence and Security Systems Ltd. has been selected as the supplier for the FiReControl infrastructure services (technology). The contract, worth an estimated &pound;200 million, over eight years, underlines the Government's commitment to invest in the nation's resilience and supports a modern fire and rescue service which is equipped to deal with incidents of every size. Contract signature is expected to take place in the next few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.2/2">At the heart of this project is the ability for the control centres to back each other up and to provide information direct to the Fire and Rescue Service, which some of the present systems cannot do. The choice of the right supplier for this project's IT requirements is therefore vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.2/3">Thales UK/EADS Defence and Security Systems Ltd. will be responsible for developing and running the IT systems that will deliver control services to the fire service&mdash;giving firefighters as much information as possible to help them tackle the incident they are attending&mdash;and ultimately aiming to further reduce deaths in fires. They and their partners have an excellent reputation for delivery and we are confident that they will provide a high quality solution for the fire and rescue services. Many elements of the proposed IT solution are already being used in a range of applications in the UK and elsewhere. A phased transition to the new system will ensure that the FRS will continue to provide a high quality service throughout.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-07a.127WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning" colnum="127WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/wmstext/70307m0001.htm#070307108000226">
	<p pid="a.127WS.4/1">Local authorities have been making very encouraging progress in working up specific proposals in the new growth points scheme. Over 45 towns and cities have been included in the scheme, which we believe should make a major contribution to achieving sustainable long-term growth. We will be reviewing the growth points scheme, whose purpose is to provide additional funding for infrastructure and delivery support, to take account of the outcome of each regional spatial strategy (RSS), and to consider with local partners our future strategy on growth points.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.4/2">In addition, local partners are already developing proposals for small new settlements linked to larger towns and cities using high quality public transport including at Cambridge (Northstowe), and the new growth point at Exeter, as well as proposals in other regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.4/3">We must cut carbon emissions to tackle climate change&mdash;and housing has a major role to play. Building the new homes we need across the country is a prime opportunity to harness new technology and drive up environmental standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.4/4">Therefore, the Government will be prepared to support proposals of this type as part of the new growth points scheme providing they are exemplar 'green' developments which meet the highest standards of sustainability in terms of the environment and climate change. They should also make use of brownfield and surplus public sector land. Proposals should focus on zero carbon or low carbon new developments of 5,000 to 10,000 homes&mdash;communities which should be big enough to support significant employment, a strong town centre and good public services. To help in the development of individual proposals and other preparatory work, we are making up to &pound;2 million available through the growth points scheme in 2007-08. A decision on further funding for small new settlements will be made in the context of CSR 07.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.4/5">As with other new growth points we will want to work closely with partners across Government including the Departments of Transport and Environment, the Environment Agency and Natural England in assessing possible schemes and with English Partnerships on delivery. Proposals would also need to support mixed communities and affordable housing. In order to ensure we learn from the lessons of the past and draw on best practice here and overseas, we are asking Professor David Lock, chair of the TCPA, to provide further advice on the practical application of the key sustainability and development criteria for schemes of this kind including carbon use, transport, services and community development and to let us have a report on this later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.4/6">As with new growth points, any proposal of this type will need to be considered through the statutory planning system and be subject to consultation and testing by independent examination, and it is important that the RSS process gives a view on proposals of this type.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.4/7">We expect schemes of this type to make an important contribution to helping to increase housing supply, particularly in the high pressure regions, as we indicated in the Government's response to the Barker review on housing supply, published in December 2005. PPS 3, the Government's statement of housing policy, which we announced in November 2006, gives local authorities greater flexibility in planning and delivery of the homes needed for their areas, with a number of choices available at a regional and local level to accommodate growth. Where need and demand are high, new settlements are one of several important options for the future distribution of housing growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.127WS.4/8">We will be making a further announcement later in the year about the detailed criteria for supporting proposals and how we can further encourage new thinking on highest quality in services, design, transport and environmental sustainability and, in particular an innovative approach to large scale zero carbon development.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-07a.130WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" speakeroffice="The Minister for the Middle East" colnum="130WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/wmstext/70307m0001.htm#070307108000228">
	<p pid="a.130WS.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has recently undertaken a review of the fees charged for visa and consular services overseas. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March 2007</phrase> Her Majesty in Council approved the Consular Fees Order 2007. This revokes and replaces the Consular Fees Order 2005. The Government are today announcing new fees to be charged under this Order with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.2/2">The Order increases fees for notarial services, estate administration, attendances, matters undertaken relating to legal proceedings and repatriation and financial assistance. It raises fees for consular assistance in births, deaths, marriages and shipping, seamen and kindred matters. The Order also increases fees for passports (issued overseas) and visas, and for certain searches undertaken by consular officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.2/3">Overseas passport fees are raised from &pound;91 to &pound;119 (standard passport for those 16 years or over), from &pound;59 to &pound;76 (standard passports for those under 16) and from &pound;109 to &pound;144 (48 page passport). The fee for amending an existing passport abroad will be increased from &pound;75.50 to &pound;97.50. The Order also raises the fee for issuing emergency passports from &pound;43.50 to &pound;55.50 and temporary passport fees are increased from &pound;55 to &pound;70.50.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.2/4">Some 60 per cent. of visa customers use commercial partners to handle their application. In addition to the basic visa fee there is an additional charge for this service, levied by the commercial partner, which varies from country to country. These fees range from &pound;3.57 to &pound;44.74 for each visa application, with an average fee of &pound;11.60. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> these applicants will no longer need to pay a separate fee to commercial partners: the cost of this service will be incorporated into the visa fee for the first time. Reflecting this, and other new costs, fees for six-month multiple entry visas have increased from &pound;50 to &pound;63, for students from &pound;85 to &pound;99 and for transit visas from &pound;30 to &pound;44. Applications for settlement and marriage visas have increased from &pound;260 to &pound;500, while applications for other visas and for a certificate of right of abode have increased from &pound;85 to &pound;200.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.2/5">The rise in visa fees reflects the full cost of providing an effective visa service which not only protects the UK from illegal working, organised crime, extremism and terrorism, but which also provides the best service to the travellers and migrants the UK wants to attract. In addition to recovering our costs, we have set the visa fees to ensure we maintain UK competitiveness and our prime place as a destination of choice for students, business, workers and visitors alike, reflecting the policy on a new charging regime announced with the Home Office today and itself the subject of a written ministerial statement. This has enabled us to set visa fees below cost for categories which are relatively sensitive. UK visas has carried out extensive research to underpin the decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.2/6">It is right that those who benefit from consular services should help meet the cost of them, rather than the UK taxpayer. The new fees represent the full economic cost of what we do, and will ensure that British missions overseas continue to provide a high standard of service to visa and consular customers. They will also enable further improvements to service delivery as set out in the 2004 Consular Strategy&mdash;updated July 2005 and presently undergoing revision prior to publication late this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.2/7">A table of the new fees has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.131WS.2/1">Following discussion with the medical Royal Colleges and the British Medical Association, I should like to set out the Department of Health's plan for an immediate review of the first round of the new national recruitment and selection process for doctors in postgraduate training.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/2">As part of the Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) reforms of postgraduate medical training, new specialty training programmes will be introduced in August 2007. To support this, a new national recruitment and selection process was introduced this year, facilitated by the on-line Medical Training Application Service (MTAS). This process sets out national recruitment and selection criteria, documentation and standards&mdash;replacing the countless local appointment processes that had previously been in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/3">The new arrangements were developed with the help of stakeholders, including the medical royal colleges and trainee doctors. We will continue to work with them to ensure that trainee doctors are properly supported and fairly treated, and that the NHS is able to train and recruit the best doctors for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/4">Doctors have been applying for their preferred specialist-training programme since <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-22">22 January 2007</phrase>. The first round of interviews began last week. A large number of jobs will not be filled in the first round and we have stressed to those interviewing in round one that they should not appoint unless they are absolutely satisfied with the calibre of candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/5">While the Department believes this will deliver a fair and transparent appointments process, it is clear that there have been a number of problems with MTAS, and that the process as a whole has created a high degree of insecurity amongst applicants and, indeed, more widely in the profession. Although it needs to be recognised that we are only part way through the first stage of a two stage process, the Department accepts that further action is required to establish greater confidence in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/6">The Department proposes, therefore, to initiate immediately an independent review of the first round of the 2007 process to ensure that appropriate lessons are learned and to take remedial action to ensure the second round of the process which begins on <phrase class="date" code="">28 April 2007</phrase> runs effectively. The terms of reference are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/7" class="indent">understand what has worked and not worked to date;</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/8" class="indent">identify and promote good practice;</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/9" class="indent">recommend action to remedy any weaknesses, taking account of legal and operational constraints;</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/10" class="indent">Identify specifically what further action or guidance is required;</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/11">immediately (or before completion of round one);</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/12">before commencement of round two;</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/13">before any subsequent rounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/14" class="indent">develop improved arrangements for the support and care of candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/15">The review will be led by Professor Neil Douglas, vice-president of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. It will take evidence widely, including from the British Medical Association (and the Junior Doctors Committee) and from a sample of junior doctors and consultants engaged in the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/16">The review will be completed by the end of March, and the findings published as soon as possible in order for lessons to be learned and changes to be made ahead of the second round.</p>
	<p pid="a.131WS.2/17">In the meantime, round one will continue as planned.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-07a.133WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" speakeroffice="The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality" colnum="133WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/wmstext/70307m0002.htm#070307108000231">
	<p pid="a.133WS.1/1">Today the Government publish the findings of the consultation paper,&quot;A consultation on a New Charging Regime for Immigration and Nationality Fees&quot;, which ran from<phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">22 December</phrase> last year. We also set out the policy on a new charging regime for immigration and nationality fees and the new and proposed in-country fee levels. The FCO is announcing newvisa levels today, after agreement by the Privy Council yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.1/2">We know that we offer highly competitive immigration services overseas and in-country and we continue to value the contribution made by migrants to the UK's economic growth and enrichment of our society. In the consultation process we were clear that any changes to the way in which we charge migrant workers and students who come to the UK must not adversely impact on the many benefits that legal migration brings.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.1/3">During the consultation period we sent out over 3,000 consultation documents and received 340 formal responses. In addition, we ran a series of 13 sector based stakeholder events with over 400 participants. These included key stakeholders in the education, business and health and social care sectors, as well as diplomats and representatives of the travel and tourism sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.1/4">We propose to move to a new flexible charging model which balances the services we offer at home and overseas, the entitlements attached to each of these and the price. In this way we believe that we can set feesat levels that minimise the operational risk to our businesses whilst generating the revenue for the next four years to help fund the transformation of the immigration system, and maintaining the global competitiveness of the UK as a place to work, visit and do business. We believe that those who benefit most from coming to the UK should contribute most to funding the end to end system. The charging system must be fair to those who use the system, in terms of the price paid for the visa and attached entitlements; and fair to the UK taxpayer, who will continue to support the immigration system that brings benefits and enrichment to this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.1/5">The new model will involve setting fees taking into account a number of factors, such as value to the migrant and international competitiveness. This will mean that for those routes that we believe to be the most sensitive to price increases, or where we believe that wider issues make a strong argument for doing so, we will set fees at cost recovery or below. Those routes that we believe, on the basis of the research, are less sensitive to increases to visa and in-country application fees and bring increased value to migrants in terms of their entitlements would be charged at levels that contribute substantially more to the overall cost of the immigration system.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.1/6">We attach the proposed in-country fee levels for immigration and nationality applications for which the relevant legislative orders will be introduced in Parliament shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.133WS.1/7">Copies of the consultation response have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and mayalso be downloaded from: <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk">www.ukvisas.gov.uk</a> or <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.135WS.2/1">Following a machinery of Government review of the Privy Council Office (PCO), the following management changes will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="">2 April 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/2" class="indent">The private offices of the Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President of the Council; the Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal; the Chief Whip in the Commons and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; and of the Lords Chief Whip and Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms will transfer to the Cabinet Office;</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/3" class="indent">The Privy Council Secretariat and support for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council will become part of the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA).</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/4">The Privy Council and its functions will continue unchanged. My right hon. and noble Friend Baroness Valerie Amos will remain the Lord President of the Council. The Privy Council Secretariat, and support for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council will retain appropriate identity and branding, and continue to carry out their duties as now. The Privy Council will continue to serve all administrations within the UK, and those private sector bodies which use its services. The Judicial Committee will remain quite distinct from the UK judicial systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/5">I periodically review the structure of Departments and arrange responsibilities in the way most suited to responding to current and future challenges. This review determined that the functions of the Privy Council Office would be best served by becoming parts of larger Departments. The Cabinet Office, like the Leaders' and Whips' offices, works to co-ordinate and to facilitate the work of Government from a cross-Departmental perspective. The Department for Constitutional Affairs already has responsibility for similar subject areas, such as liaison with the Crown Dependencies and royal hereditary matters, and this is therefore the most appropriate home for the Privy Council Secretariat and the support for the Judicial Committee.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-07a.136WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1981" speakername="Alistair Darling" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry" colnum="136WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070307/wmstext/70307m0002.htm#070307108000233">
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/1">Last summer the Government asked the Low Pay Commission to produce its next report on the national minimum wage by the end of February 2007. The Government are today publishing that report.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/2">I would like to thank the Chair of the Commission, Paul Myners, for the important role he has played in what is the first report under his chairmanship. I would also like to thank all the Commissioners for their hard work. It is particularly appropriate to acknowledge the hard work and contributions made over the years by those Commissioners who are stepping down from office this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/3">The main recommendations put forward by the Commission concern the rates of the minimum wage. The Commission has recommended the adult hourly rate of the minimum wage should be increased from &pound;5.35 to &pound;5.52 in October 2007. The Commission has recommended increasing the development rate, which covers workers aged 18-21-year-olds, from the present &pound;4.45 to &pound;4.60 in October 2007, and the 16-17 year old rate from &pound;3.30 to &pound;3.40, again from October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/4">The Government have accepted these recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/5">The Government also accept:</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/6" class="indent">the recommendation that it should work more collaboratively with other organisations to raise awareness;</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/7" class="indent">the recommendation that the next sector for targeted enforcement should be one with a high concentration of migrant workers. We have chosen the hotel sector for the third year of the programme. We will build on our work by targeting hospitality more generally in year four.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/8" class="indent">the recommendation relating to social care that we should continue to make clear that the commissioning policies of local authorities should reflect the costs of care provision; and to monitor practice, examine the reasons for any uneven provision, and, if appropriate, provide further guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/9" class="indent">the recommendation that the accommodation offset should increase to &pound;4.30 per day in October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/10" class="indent">the recommendation that the Government should ask the Commission to report in early 2008 on recommended rates for October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/11">The Government will consider:</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/12" class="indent">the recommendation of introducing a penalty to apply to any employer found to have underpaid the minimum wage;</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/13" class="indent">the recommendation that the Commission should carry out a full review of the apprenticeship exemptions in its next report;</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/14">The Government reject the recommendation that 21-year-old workers should be paid the adult rate. The most recent data on employment continue to show the employment rate of 21-year-olds are more closely aligned to 20-year-olds than to those aged 22 years and above. We believe moving 21-year-olds on to the adult rate would risk damaging their employment prospects.</p>
	<p pid="a.136WS.2/15">I have placed copies of this statement, the report by the Low Pay Commission, the Government's individual response to the Commission's recommendations in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.137WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-16">16 January</phrase> the Government appointed Paul Thornton to undertake an independent external review of pensions institutions. The purpose of the review&mdash;announced in the May 2006 Pensions White Paper&mdash;is to look at how the responsibilities of those bodies involved in workplace pensions are arranged to ensure they support existing Government policy, fit with its reform proposals, and wider developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.137WS.2/2">I am pleased to advise the House that Paul Thornton today published a consultation paper with an invitation for contributions by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase>. A copy is in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.137WS.2/3">The document sets out the emerging issues and evidence presented so far, with the aim of encouraging further discussion and building consensus on the way forward. I encourage stakeholders to contribute: it is vital that institutional functions are arranged in the most efficient and effective way in order to support work-basedsaving and to complement our pension reforms. The consultation paper will be available on the Department's pensions reform internet site later today. Paul Thornton will report to Ministers with recommendations byspring 2007.</p>
