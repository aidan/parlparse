	<p pid="b.93WS.2/3">Ministers adopted Council opinions on the stability programmes of Germany, Italy, Finland, Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands and on the convergence programmes of the UK, Hungary, Sweden, Romania and Slovakia.

	<p pid="b.93WS.2/5">(i) Contribution to the spring European Council conclusions: key issues paper</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/6">Ministers adopted a key issues paper ahead of the spring European Council. This paper is comprised of five sections: an overview of the economic situation; structural reform for growth and jobs; public finances; financial markets; and European monetary union. Annexed to the key issues paper is an opinion on the Community Lisbon programme&mdash;the proposed set of Community level actions to support the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth. The UK endorses the paper and looks forward to discussion of these issues at spring Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/7">(ii) Efficiency of economic instruments for energy and climate change</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/8">Ministers agreed a set of conclusions stressing the importance of the efficiency of economic instruments for energy and climate change, based on a report from the EPC working group on climate change. The UK strongly supports these conclusions and believes that it is crucial for Finance Ministers to engage with this important agenda. Work on the economic dimension of energy and climate change and on the international financing aspects of global action will now continue at working group level with a view to providing an update to ECOFIN in autumn 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/9" class="italic">Better regulation</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/10">Ministers exchanged views on better regulation in view of the recent publication of the European Commission's second &quot;strategic review&quot;. Ministers agreed that this was an important agenda that all Council formations should engage with. The UK supports the positive efforts of the Commission and welcomes the progress made both at member states and EU level towards reducing administrative burdens in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/11" class="italic">General Budget of the European Union&mdash;Discharge Procedure in respect of the Implementation of the Budget for 2006</p>
	<p pid="b.93WS.2/12">Ministers adopted a recommendation for discharge of the 2006 EU budget, on which the European Court of Auditors presented its report to ECOFIN in November 2007. The UK particularly supported the emphasis put on the need for all actors involved in the implementation of EU expenditure to continue to improve the functioning of supervisory and control systems in order to make further progress towards achieving a positive statement of assurance in all areas of the EC budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.94WS.1/5">(i) Broad economic policy guidelines 2008-10/11 and country-specific integrated recommendations</p>
	<p pid="b.94WS.1/6">This discussion follows the orientation debate on these documents at the January ECOFIN and further drafting amendments in the Economic Policy Committee and Economic and Financial Committee.

	<p pid="b.94WS.1/12">Ministers will be invited to adopt conclusions agreeing the Council's budget guidelines for the 2009 EC budget. These guidelines are a set of broad principles which are designed to inform the subsequent and more detailed discussions on the level of appropriations required for the different areas of the budget. The subsequent negotiations throughout 2008 will determine the amounts to be spent under each budget heading.</p>

	<p pid="b.94WS.1/14">The fight against tax fraud</p>
	<p pid="b.94WS.1/15">Following discussion of the issue at ECOFIN in December 2007, Ministers will be asked to agree conclusions on work to improve arrangements to combat tax fraud, which have been prepared on the basis of a report by the Commission. The UK is strongly supportive of work that will help in the fight against missing trader intra-community (MTIC) and other VAT fraud, while remaining committed to minimising the burdens on legitimate businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.94WS.1/16">Taxation of savings</p>
	<p pid="b.94WS.1/17">Ministers will hear an update from the European Commission on progress made in extending the framework of the EU savings directive to third countries.

	<p pid="b.95WS.5/1">My noble Friend the Minister for Sustainable Food and Farming and Animal Health represented the United Kingdom at this month's Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/2">The Council held a policy debate, based on a presidency questionnaire, on the Commission's communication on the CAP health check. The questionnaire asked Ministers to identify their three priorities for the health check and to present their objectives for dairy reform. The UK called for full decoupling, the dismantling of all market instruments, an increase in compulsory modulation to fund environmental challenges and we opposed limits on higher farm payments, due to the distortion and bureaucracy which that would entail. Member states expressed a wide range of views.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/3">The Council failed to reach a qualified majority for or against on the five proposals to authorise the importation, processing and marketing of four types of GM maize for use in food and animal feed and also for the use of one type of GM potato for use in animal feed. The Commission will now take a decision under its own authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/4">Under any other business, the Netherlands suggested the use of CITES&mdash;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora&mdash;as an additional legislative option to combat the illegal timber trade. The UK intervened to support the principle but called for all possible tools to be used, as CITES was not the most effective instrument to combat illegal logging.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/5">The Netherlands, supported by 13 member states, also drew the Commission's attention to the inadequate levels of co-financing available for funding the bluetongue vaccination programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/6">Cyprus, supported by Greece, drew attention to the consequences of recent droughts on the domestic farming sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/7">Sweden, supported by a few member states, expressed concerns following the European Court of Justice's ruling concerning the eligibility criteria for the bovine slaughter premium and asked the Commission to bring forward a proposal rectifying the situation. The Agriculture Commissioner said that a proposal was currently being drafted that would prevent the problem from 2008 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/8">Germany, supported by a few member states, called for further relief measures in the form of private storage aid and export refunds to alleviate the difficulties currently being experienced in the pigmeat sector. The Agriculture Commissioner said that a proposal to extend private storage by a further three months would be submitted to the Pigmeat Management Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-21">21 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/9">Belgium, supported by France, drew the Commission's attention to the level of economic damage caused by bluetongue and asked for the use of exceptional market support measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.95WS.5/10">The Agriculture Commissioner updated the Council on the state of play on the WTO negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="b.96WS.5/1">I am pleased to announce that light dues rates and the tonnage threshold will remain the same for 2008-09. As a result of continuing efficiency gains made by the general lighthouse authorities we were able to cut dues by 10 per cent. in 2006, which we held down at that level in 2007 and now will hold again in 2008. We shall continue to work closely with the general lighthouse authorities to streamline and improve services further to reduce costs where we can, while maintaining prudent funding to meet their liabilities and high standards of safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.96WS.5/2">I also welcome the publication of the Irish lights evidence study today. The study sets out evidence on the funding of the provision of aids to navigation in the Republic of Ireland. It will provide the basis for negotiations between the UK and Irish Governments to find a long term funding solution for the Commissioners of Irish Lights. I am placing copies of the study in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	Road and Rail Capacity (East of England)

	<p pid="b.97WS.1/1">I am today announcing plans for my Department to take forward work to consider the long-term capacity of the M11 motorway and the West Anglia main line. This is in recognition of the proposed growth in the draft East of England plan and the need to support this with effective and sustainable transport links. This work would also need to take account of potential expansion of Stansted airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/2">Last year my predecessor announced publication of the Highways Agency's consultation on plans to widen the M11 between junction 6 and junction 8, and to improve the junction access from the M11 and the A120 to Stansted airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/3">I consider that the form of capacity improvements to the M11 in the period before 2030 requires further assessment and as a result I have asked the Highways Agency to carry out further work to look into this. This work will take account of the forecast growth in the region and ensure that, in seeking to exploit the region's economic opportunities, we do so in a socially and environmentally sustainable way, considering a range of ways to provide the additional capacity that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/4">If this work determines that widening the M11 is needed, it has been agreed that BAA would contribute to the overall costs, subject to the necessary referral to the economic regulator. My Department will announce shortly the results of the consultation on the schemes required to provide access from the M11 and A120 to an expanded Stansted airport, which BAA has agreed to fund in full.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/5">I also recognise that growth in the region and the associated number of new houses will place additional pressures on the West Anglia main line between Liverpool Street station and Cambridge.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/6">Therefore, to complement the Highways Agency's further work on the M11, I am also asking Network Rail to develop and bring forward proposals for enhancing the West Anglia main line. This work should examine the case for further enhancements, to provide for longer term capacity and service improvements, in the context of Network Rail's recent Greater Anglia route utilisation strategy (RUS).</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/7">Following recent feasibility work led by my Department, I confirm that this assessment should incorporate consideration of line and route improvements including a potential four-tracking option from Tottenham Hale to south of Cheshunt, and an assessment of what commitments would be needed to deliver this solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/8">The anticipated timescales for this assessment are for necessary development work and powers to be completed within railway control period 4 (2009-14), with a view to targeting delivery in control period 5 (2014-19).</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/9">This would be in addition to the more immediate capacity enhancements I announced in my White Paper &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot;, and the High Level Output Specification (HLOS), which were published last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/10">As with the M11, this work will draw on forecast demand from wider regional growth, as well as from the potential increase in passengers resulting from any expansion of Stansted airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/11">Both the work on the M11 and the West Anglia main line will be led by my Department, engaging industry, developers and other key stakeholders as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.97WS.1/12">I aim to report progress on both of these projects later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.98WS.2/1">Today I am publishing the independent living strategy. This is a cross-Government strategy that will give disabled people more choice and control over the services they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/2">The independent living review was launched in July 2006 to find imaginative and practical ways of supporting independent living for disabled people. The Office for Disability Issues has led the development of the strategy, bringing together the views and experience of disabled people, organisations of disabled people, service delivery organisations and central and local government officials. The strategy has been developed with and is jointly owned by the Departments of Health, Transport, Work and Pensions, Children, Schools and Families, Communities and Local Government, and Innovation, Universities and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/3">The strategy marks a unique and radical approach to Government working. It has been developed in partnership with disabled people to ensure that it reflects their real life experiences of the barriers to independent living and has drawn on their expertise to identify how to address these barriers. An expert panel, chaired by Baroness Jane Campbell, has advised on the strategy's development and disabled people&mdash;including younger disabled people who are reaching adulthood, and older disabled people&mdash;have been involved in meetings and workshops during the development of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/4">The strategy draws together recent Government commitments to remove barriers to independent living and to improve access to services, including better support for older people in their current homes, improved support for disabled young people and their families, and additional investment to transform support to older and disabled people. The strategy also makes a series of new commitments including:</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/5" class="indent">Demonstrating how to move resources from professional assessment and care management to user-led support, advocacy and brokerage to ensure people get the right support to make decisions for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/6" class="indent">A regional initiative to promote independent living for older disabled people with high support needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/7" class="indent">A national strategy to enable people to remain in employment when they acquire an impairment or their condition worsens.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/8" class="indent">An awareness campaign aimed at practitioners in social work, the National Health Service and elsewhere, and disabled people themselves to ensure that health, social care and other services are delivered in ways which enable disabled people to have choice and control over how their needs are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/9" class="indent">A new toolkit to assist the development of local independent living strategies for and with older disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/10" class="indent">Good practice guidance to enable people to have choice and control over their continuing health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/11">The strategy is designed to make a real and measurable impact on the lives of disabled people and contains a commitment to monitor the impact of the strategy, year-on-year, in partnership with disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.98WS.2/12">The Government are committed to equality for all disabled people by 2025. Today's independent living strategy is a major step towards achieving this aim.</p>
