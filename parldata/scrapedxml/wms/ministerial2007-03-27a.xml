	<p pid="a.71WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase> I announced that in response to our Invitation to Councils we had received 26 proposals from local authorities for the creation of unitary local government in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/2">We have now completed our assessment of these proposals against the five criteria set out in the Invitation. These criteria are that change to future unitary structures must be affordable, and be supported by a broad cross section of partners and stakeholders; and the future structures must provide strong, effective and accountable strategic leadership, deliver genuine opportunities for neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment, and deliver value for money and equity on public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/3">On the basis of this assessment my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has decided that the following unitary proposals will proceed to stakeholder consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.71WS.2/25">In reaching her decision, my right hon. Friendhas had regard to the submitted proposals, any supplementary material submitted by the proposers themselves, and other available relevant information. Her judgment is that there is at least a reasonable likelihood that these proposals, if implemented, would achieve the outcomes specified by the five criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/26">We are launching this consultation today, seeking the views of partners and stakeholders in the areas affected by the proposals. As the Invitation explains, partners and stakeholders include all local authorities, thewider public sector, the business community, and the voluntary and community sector. It is, however, open to anyone to respond to the consultation document that we are issuing today, copies of which are placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/27">We are in particular seeking views on the extent to which consultees believe the proposals would deliver the outcomes specified by the criteria, and in the case of the alternative proposals for Bedfordshire, Cheshire and Northumberland, which of the alternatives in each case would better deliver those outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/28">The consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="">22 June 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/29">After the stakeholder consultation, we will consider very carefully all the representations that we have received. Proposals will proceed to implementation if, and only if, when we take our final decisions, we remain satisfied that they meet the criteria, and that the overall use of reserves remains affordable, having regard to the prevailing fiscal position and the risks around the estimated costs of implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/30">As explained in our original Invitation, implementation of any proposals involving transitional costs financed by the use of reserves impacts on planned public expenditure totals. Any use of reserves must therefore in aggregate be within the limited envelope available.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/31">It was because of this limited envelope that the Invitation stated that the Government think it unlikely that it would be able to implement more than eight proposals, but that this maximum number would not preclude the Government from deciding to implement more if they offered good value for money and were affordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/32">If when we take our final decisions there are more proposals that meet the criteria than we can afford to implement, we will prioritise in order to decidewhich ones to implement. We will consult during our main stakeholder consultation on the proposedmeans of prioritising restructuring proposals in such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/33">If implemented, the proposals could, on the basis of current estimates, save up to around &pound;200 million annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/34">In those cases where there are alternative proposals, any decision on implementation will necessarily involve a decision as to which option should proceed. If we were to decide that Bedford Borough's proposal should proceed to implementation we may need to consider the future local government structures in the remaining county area which might no longer be a viable two-tier area.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/35">The legislative provision necessary to implement unitary proposals is contained in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill which is currently before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/36">Finally, in respect of the following proposals, my right hon. Friend has decided that, having regard to the available relevant information, there is not a reasonable likelihood that, if implemented, they would achieve all the outcomes specified in the five criteria, and that accordingly they should not proceed to stakeholder consultation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-27a.74WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" speakername="Derek Twigg" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="74WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070327/wmstext/70327m0001.htm#07032768000338">
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/1">Over the past 12 months the Ministry of Defence has undertaken a thorough review of the Defence Medical Services (DMS) manpower requirement. The aim of this review was to determine the number of uniformed, regular DMS personnel required to support operations consistent with overall Defence Planning Assumptions, provide full healthcare and allow for continued training and the provision of headquarters staff during deployment. The review has now been completed and I am now in a position to inform the House of the new DMS manpower requirement. I am convinced it provides a credible baseline on which the DMS can base its planning and ensure that the excellent level of healthcare which it provides both on operations and, in collaboration with the NHS, in the UK, is sustained into the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/2">The last full review of the DMS uniformed regular manpower requirement took place at the time of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) over eight yearsago, and produced a requirement for a grand total of 8,970 posts (the 'SDR total'). This however exceeded the available medical manpower, and subsequent experience in support of deployed operations showed that a different balance of medical specialisms was more appropriate. Hence a lower overall figure was adopted as a pragmatic interim basis for funding a different mix of established posts (the 'established liability'). To ensure that the requirement was valid not just in the light of emerging practice on operations since SDR, but also to be consistent with current defence-wide planning assumptions, a formal review was undertaken, starting in January 2006. The review was carried out by the multi-disciplinary Medical Operational Capability (Med Op Cap) project team, drawing on previous studies, lessons learned work, high-level operational analysis and incorporating military judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/3">The overall result of this work is that the DMS baseline uniformed regular manning requirement(the 'Med Op Cap requirement') has now been set at 7,573 posts plus an additional manning and training margin of 678, making a grand total of 8,251 posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/4">This compares to the previous established liability of 7,741 posts plus a manning and training margin of 543, making a grand total of 8,284 posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/5">The SDR grand total of 8,970 posts did not separately specify within it a manning and training margin.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/6">As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, the uniformed regular manning was 6,497 (namely, the number of people we actually have, rather than the number of posts required).</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/7">There are also some significant changes within individual medical cadres between the SDR and the Med Op Cap requirement, with some cadres increasing and some decreasing. Some additional potential for civilianisation of up to 320 posts in the Med Op Cap total requirement was identified by the review, which will be investigated further.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/8">I shall place full details of the new requirements against individual cadres in the Library of the House. It is a necessarily complex package, but one which provides an essential building-block for the DMS to focus its efforts on addressing the most critical shortfalls.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/9">The impact of the new requirement on the individual career paths for personnel in the Royal Navy, Army and RAF Medical Services will be small. The review has validated the existing policy of maximising capability from staffing our Field Hospitals on a collaborative tri-Service basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.4/10">The Government are committed to ensuring that the DMS continues to be sufficiently flexible to respond to future operational challenges. The recent review of the DMS uniformed regular manpower requirement is a necessary and positive step to achieving this.</p>

	<p pid="a.75WS.2/1">I represented the United Kingdom at this month's Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/2">The Council adopted conclusions on the Commission communication on employment in rural areas, stressing the development of job creation in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/3">The Council reached a unanimous political agreement on a Presidency compromise proposal, laying down rules for voluntary modulation (VM) in light of the December 2005 European Council future financing agreement for 2007-2013. I voted in favour of the compromise text, as it delivered the flexibility we had argued for with regards to applying voluntary modulation on a regional basis without a franchise applying. I also indicated that the UK will make a formal declaration at the time the regulation is adopted which states that: all four regions of the UK would use VM; the rate would be below 20 per cent.; and that in England we would spend 80 per cent. of VM receipts on environmental measures and would co-finance these at a significant level. A joint declaration was also made by the Council and Commission emphasising that VM and all pillar two funding arrangements should be reviewed in the context of the CAP Healthcheck.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/4">The Presidency and Commission summed up the informal lunchtime discussion on implementation of controls in the food chain. The Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner urged all Member States to implement EU food law fully and effectively. The Presidency too called on all Member States to maintain Community standards, whilst acknowledging that EU food safety legislation needed to be kept under review with particular emphasis on reducing unnecessary administrative burdens.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/5">There was a policy debate on the Commission's simplification proposal on the common organisation of agricultural markets, based on three Presidency questions: timing of inclusion of the fruit and vegetable and wine sectors; transfer of competence from Council to Commission; abolition of Pigmeat intervention. The proposal aims to consolidate the existing 21 sector-specific Common Market Organisations into a single Regulation, in an effort to streamline and simplify the legal framework. Along with other Member States, I broadly supported the Commission's proposal as an important step in the CAP simplification action plan and agreed that a case-by-case approach should be taken to the transfer of competence for implementing powers from the Council to the Commission. Some Member States did not agree to the inclusion of the fruit and vegetables and wine sectors in the Single Common Market Organisation in advance of the reform of those sectors, and opposed the abolition of pigmeat intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/6">A number of issues were raised under any other business, none of which required any intervention on behalf of the United Kingdom. These were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/7" class="indent">The Environment Commissioner presented the Commission's Soil Thematic Strategy, for information only, as it falls within Environment Council competence. A number of Member States expressed concern at the administrative burdens the proposed strategy would have on agriculture and argued for the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity as previously discussed at January Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/8" class="indent">The Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner gave a written update on Avian Influenza and reported on the recent EC-Russian Federation veterinary agreement negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/9" class="indent">The Presidency updated the Council on the outcomes of two recent conferences: &quot;Fuelling the Future&mdash;Renewable Resources&quot; and &quot;Prevention for Health&mdash;Nutrition and Physical Activity&mdash;A Key to Healthy Living.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.2/10" class="indent">The Agriculture Commissioner updated Council on the state of play of the WTO Agriculture negotiations following her bilateral contacts with some WTO partners (United States, India, Brazil and Japan). She said that despite fruitful technical discussions there had been no breakthrough in negotiations. In reply to some Member States, the Commissioner confirmed that the EU's position in the negotiations is still its offer from October 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.77WS.2/1">In my statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March 2007</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, col 557-8, I set out the background to the review of the new national recruitment and selection process for doctors in postgraduate training. I outlined the decisions that had been made by the review group up to that date. As the review group continued to meet last week, the purpose of this statement is to provide a further update on progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/2">The review group issued a further statement on<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-22">22 March</phrase>. This said:</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Building on last week's announcement, at a minimum, every long-listable applicant who applied through Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) and meets the eligibility criteria for their relevant specialty will be invited for an interview. Under this guaranteed interview scheme, candidates will be able to choose which of their preferences to be interviewed for in light of geographic specialty-specific and specialty training level-specific competition ratios which will be available on the MTAS website. We are in discussion about the implications of this for the timetable.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/4" class="indent">The recruitment system has worked satisfactorily for general practice and this will continue. In other specialities, there is evidence that the short-listing process was weak and we will therefore eliminate this part of the process immediately. In contrast, the interview process has been working and therefore the revised approach will ensure that all long-listable candidates will be interviewed. The review group believes that this new approach is the most equitable and practical solution available. The group also recognises the enormous effort by the consultants, service and deans that has already taken place to ensure that the interview process has worked. The time and effort required for further interviews is recognised by the service and the time required will be made available. Therefore first choice interviews that have already taken place should not need to be repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/5" class="indent">In accordance with the advice already issued, we reiterate that all interviews will be informed by the use of CVs and portfolios and probing questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/6" class="indent">In broad terms, this means that all eligible applicants at every stage of their training, whether or not they have already had interviews or interview offers, will be able to review their stated first choice preference and have the opportunity to select the one for which they want to be interviewed. We will be discussing operational details over the next week and these may differ between specialties and between different parts of the UK dependent on local circumstances. We will also consult widely. Exact details for how applicants will be able to do this will be available week commencing <phrase class="date" code="">2 April</phrase> on the MMC website at <a href="http://www.mmc.nhs.uk">www.mmc.nhs.uk</a>. In the meantime, interviews will continue and applicants should attend unless they are confident that this will not be their preferred choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/7" class="indent">No job offers will be made until all these interviews have taken place. Discussions are taking place on the implications of this for the filling of General Practice training places. We expect that the majority of training places will be filled through these interviews. Unfilled vacancies will be filled through further interviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/8" class="indent">The review group has recommended the development of a programme of career support for applicants at all stages of the process. Further details to support applicants, deans and selectors through this process will be available next week on the MMC website. Future work will explore what the possibilities might be for doctors to change specialties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/9">This represents a reasonable way forward to meet both the aspirations of junior doctors and the timetable for making appointments for August. I therefore regret the fact that the British Medical Association representatives have withdrawn from the group. Despite this, the important work of the review group will continue and I would encourage the British Medical Association representatives to come back to the table to ensure that all stakeholders can work together to take forward a workable solution to these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/10">I am glad to note that the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges supports this revised approach. They believe that with the work of the review group it offers the most equitable and practical solution available.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/11">The timetable for the group's work is very tight and the next two weeks will see important progress. Applicants, consultants, employers and all those with a stake in the process will be anxious to be kept informed of progress. I trust that the House will understand if we continue to issue updates on important developments during the recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.2/12">As ever, I am very grateful to Professor Douglas and his colleagues for their continuing work on the review group. We will publish the group's final report once it is completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.83WS.2/1">Today I am publishing &quot;Working for Children&quot; (Cm:7067) which includes our response to recommendations made in the report &quot;Delivering on Child Poverty: what would it take?&quot; by Lisa Harker in November 2006. It is only one element of a cross-governmental child poverty strategy and sets out the additional measures DWP will take to maximise its contribution to the ambitious targets of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/2">Building on the announcements made in the Budget to take a further 200,000 children out of poverty by increasing tax credits and wider support for parents, &quot;Working for Children&quot; refocuses &pound;150 million of resources within the Department for Work and Pensions towards greater support for families.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/3">Measures include:</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/4" class="indent">Piloting a New Deal for Families approach so more families get access to support that is often only available for lone parents. To do this we will extend support available in the New Deal for Lone Parents Plus pilot areas to all families with children in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/5" class="indent">Extending the New Deal for Lone Parents Plus scheme to help more lone parents benefit from this service and signalling initial support ahead of a period of consultation for recommendations from David Freud to increase obligations on lone parents with older children to look for work.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/6" class="indent">Providing more support to families, particularly in London where employment rates lag, including widening and improving the in-work credit scheme which provides additional financial support for lone parents as they make the transition to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/7" class="indent">Changing Jobcentre Plus systems so parents are properly identified in the benefit system for the first time and record the childcare needs and preferences of all parents - not just lone parents as at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.83WS.2/9">We have made significant progress by lifting 600,000 children out of relative poverty since the Prime Minister set the historic target in 1998 to eradicate child poverty by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/10">Our success in helping people into work has been key to reducing child poverty. We have seen 2.5 million more people in work than in 1997 and there are now over 1 million lone parents in employment. We need to continue to build on this success but recognise there is more to do if we are to reach our goal.</p>
	<p pid="a.83WS.2/11">Copies of the report are available from the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.84WS.1/1">I am pleased to announce the local authorities that have been chosen to pilot a sanction of Housing Benefit linked to anti-social behaviour. The sanction, contained in the Welfare Reform Bill (Clause 31), is part of the Respect programme and would apply where a household has been evicted for anti-social behaviour and subsequently refuses to engage with rehabilitation services offered. It will give local authorities an additional tool for tackling anti-social behaviour in order to achieve a culture of self-respect, respect for others and respect for community.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.1/2">The intention is to pilot the scheme for a period of two years (subject to the Bill receiving Royal Assent) in the following local authorities:</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.1/3" class="indent">Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.1/4" class="indent">Blackpool Borough Council</p>

	Depleted Uranium Oversight Board

	<p pid="a.84WS.3/1">The Depleted Uranium Oversight Board (DUOB) was established in 2001 to oversee a screening programme for veterans of the 1991 Gulf conflict and subsequent Balkans operations concerned about possible exposure to depleted uranium. Testing based on the analysis of urine samples for trace quantities of uranium isotopes was offered between 2004 and 2006. A total of 496 applicants completed the test.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.3/2">The final report of the DUOB is now available and can be accessed from the website <a href="http://www.duob.org.uk">www.duob.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.3/3">The board was unable to achieve complete consensus on the interpretation and significance of the test results. However, no evidence of the excretion of depleted uranium was found in the urine of any of the test participants. According to mainstream scientific and medical opinion, this means that none had suffered an exposure to DU of sufficient magnitude likely to cause a risk to their health.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.3/4">I welcome these findings and believe they will have provided valuable reassurance and peace of mind to the veterans concerned.</p>
