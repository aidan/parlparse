	<p>I have today placed the independent review of BBC Online by Philip Graf in the Libraries of both Houses, together with a copy of the letter I have written to the Chairman of the Governors. The report is also available electronically on the Department's website <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p>In response to the review, I have asked the BBC to consider all of Philip Graf's recommendations, and to respond fully by the end of October 2004. I have asked that the Governors' response include a redrafted version of Online's remit and a statement of how the corporation intends to involve the independent sector along the lines set out by the report.</p>
	<p>I have not, at this stage, imposed any further conditions on BBC Online.</p>
	<p>The reviews will begin immediately and will run concurrently. In accordance with conditions that I laid down when giving my approval for the BBC to develop these new digital services, both reviews will include both a period of public consultation and a market impact study. I have asked both reviewers to submit their reports to me by the end of August 2004.</p>
