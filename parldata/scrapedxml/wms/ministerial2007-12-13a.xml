<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-13a.48WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government" colnum="48WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/wmstext/71213m0001.htm#07121366000925">
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/1">The Government's commitment to provide decent final salary pensions for those employed by local authorities and other organisations associated with local government is matched by the need to ensure that members' pensionsare secure, affordable and viable, and fair to taxpayers who guarantee their security.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/2">The Government see it as critical to maintain stability of costs in the scheme over the years ahead, particularly in the new-look Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in England and Wales from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. The intention remains to ensure that no additional costs are imposed on taxpayers or employers. This objective is central to any considerations involving amendments to the scheme's regulatory framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/3">A statutory consultation with all scheme stakeholders in England and Wales on proposals to extend the current levels of protection in the scheme for older employees began on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July 2007</phrase> and ended on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>. The protections were originally introduced by the local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment) and (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2006 and took effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>. The draft proposals would involve amending the regulations to provide a full, rather than a tapered, protection for the period 2016 to 2020, together with appropriate offsetting savings for the estimated cost of this benefit improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/4">To ensure the continuing solvency of the scheme and to meet the Government's standing policy on ensuring no adverse effects on taxpayers, the costs of implementing any scheme amendments to improve the level of protections would need to be provided from within the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/5">The costings for the additional rule of 85 protections were provided by the Government Actuary's Department (GAD), based on the data provided for the 2004 LGPS actuarial valuation exercise. GAD estimated that the capital cost of removing the current tapered protections between 2016 and 2020 was some &pound;0.35 billion&mdash;&pound;0.4 billion. In payroll terms, this equates to about 0.1 per cent. or some &pound;25 million annually for 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/6">If no agreed means of providing the necessary resources to extend the proposed level of protection emerge from the consultation, then it will be necessary to retain the present level of protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/7">The responses received to the recent consultation exercise have been considered carefully and analysed against agreed criteria regarding affordability and legality, as set out in the Department's consultation letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/8">The consultation has demonstrated strong views from all stakeholders in terms both of the level of protections and affordability. I wish, however, to be clear about the most recent position in the scheme regarding costs, the likely numbers of potentially affected older scheme members, and the range of other cost-influencing variables.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/9">In the light of these representations, I have taken no final decision on the outcome of the statutory consultation exercise and, in view of the data from the 2007 LGPS actuarial valuations which are due to become available early in the new year, I have decided to ask the Local Government Pension Scheme Policy Review Group, with the assistance of GAD, to undertake a fresh costings exercise using emerging data from the 2007 LGPS actuarial valuations. This will allow a new assessment of the current cost position and also provide an opportunity for all the interested stakeholders to engage fully in the review process.</p>
	<p pid="a.48WS.4/10">The exercise for updating of costs is expected to be completed early in the new year. A final decision on the proposed amendment and within the policy parameters of affordability and legality will then be made, taking full account of any further representations which may be made by stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.56WS.2/1">The Russian authorities announced yesterday that they planned to shut down the British Council's offices in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/2">Russia's threatened actions are illegal. The British Council's presence in Russia is entirely consistent with international law, including the Vienna Conventions. Its presence and activities are also specifically sanctioned by a 1994 UK/Russia Agreement on Co-operation in Education, Science and Culture, signed by Russia, and which binds both the UK and Russia. The British Council is the designated agent of the British Government for the implementation of the agreement. For the past nine years, the UK has been keen to conclude a further Cultural Centres Agreement with Russia. Pending such an agreement being reached, the 1994 Agreement remains in force.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/3">For Russia to carry out its threat would therefore constitute a serious attack against the legitimate cultural agent of the British Government would show a disregard for the rule of law and would only damage Russia's reputation around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/4">Damage will also be done to EU-Russia cultural co-operation. We are discussing with partners (including the EU and the G7), the implications of Russia's threat. I am grateful to the European Commission for expressing its concern to Russia about the situation facing the British Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/5">Overall, Russia's threats set back bilateral and multilateral efforts to improve cultural links, severely affect large numbers of Russians who benefit from the British Council's presence, and damage Russia's reputation around the world. We are urging the Russian authorities to reconsider. At the same time we are working closely with the British Council to ensure the welfare of their staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/6">I will keep the House informed of developments.</p>

	<p pid="a.57WS.1/1">The Government regret the unilateral decision by the Russian Federation to cease compliance with its obligations under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (CPE) from <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-12">12 December</phrase>. Russia has sought to explain this decision principally on the grounds that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have not ratified the adapted version of the CFE treaty. Together with our NATO allies, the United Kingdom has made a public statement (<a href="http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2007/p07-139e.html">http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2007/p07-139e.html</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.1/2">This Russian decision is unjustified. The United Kingdom, along with NATO allies, has made clear our commitment to ratify as quickly as possible the adaptation of the CFE treaty, which would provide the basis for addressing most of Russia's concerns about the current CFE regime. But it remains right that Russia should in parallel honour its own commitments, made at the 1999 Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe summit in Istanbul, to regularise the status of its forces and equipment in Georgia and Moldova. The principle that host nation consent is required for the stationing of foreign forces is central to effective security and stability in Europe. NATO has engaged intensively with the Russian Federation to seek ways of overcoming differences over how to ensure both these sets of commitments are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.1/3">The Government also consider that the Russian Federation's &quot;suspension&quot; of their obligations cannot be justified either under the provisions of the CFE Treaty or on the grounds set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Accordingly, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-11">11 December</phrase>, we sent a Note Verbale, via the Treaty Depository, to all CFE States Parties, making this clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.1/4">We judge, however, that European security is not fundamentally or immediately threatened by this Russian action. In the short term, we understand Russia will stop exchanging data or sending notifications on the whereabouts and composition of its conventional forces, and will refuse to allow verification inspections. However, if Russia were to persist in this course of action, in the longer-term that would erode the transparency and predictability which the CFE regime contributes to overall stability in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.57WS.1/5">To help maintain that stability, the United Kingdom will until further notice, along with its NATO allies, continue to honour all our obligations under the CFE Treaty, including towards the Russian Federation. We will assess the impact of any non-compliance by the Russian Federation, and consult with NATO allies on a further joint response. With NATO allies, we will also continue to promote engagement with the Russi.an Federation with a view to reaching an agreed way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.58WS.2/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December 2007</phrase>. The health part was held on the <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>. I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/2">The Council adopted conclusions on the Portuguese presidency theme of health and migration in the European Union. In a policy debate, Ministers discussed the challenges and opportunities in health presented by migration.</p>

	<p pid="a.58WS.2/5">Over lunch there was an informal discussion on health services, on which Commission proposals are expected shortly. Ministers urged caution: it was important to avoid creating inequalities through a system that allowed a few to shop around for care. The proposals should not go further than the ECJ jurisprudence, and member states should be able to use prior authorisation systems for hospital care.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/6">Slovenia outlined their priorities in health for the forthcoming Slovene presidency. Cancer would be their main priority. They would also be taking forward work on anti-microbial resistance, and highlighting the implementation of policies to tackle alcohol-related harm and cooperation in the area of pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-13a.58WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1648" speakername="Alan Johnson" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health" colnum="58WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/wmstext/71213m0003.htm#07121366000935">
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/1">I am pleased to announce today the 2008-09 revenue allocations for primary care trusts (PCTs) and the NHS Operating Framework for 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/2">All primary care trusts will receive a cash increase of 5.5 per cent., a total cash increase of &pound;3.8 billion, bringing the total revenue allocations to &pound;74 billion. In addition, &pound;1.7 billion of non-recurrent budgets are also being issued, meaning that 82 per cent. of the total NHS revenue budget will be issued direct to primary care trusts compared to 72 per cent. in 1996-97. Overall, we have trebled investment in the NHS from &pound;35 billion to &pound;110 billion by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/3">I am keen to continue to raise the transparency and accountability of the NHS and, consequently, I have written individually to all hon. Members in England detailing their relevant PCTs' allocations for 2008-09 and have noted how their current allocations compare to those for 2007-08. I have also included with this written statement, a table detailing 2008-09 PCT allocations.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/4">As I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase>, the revenue allocations will be for 2008-09 only, as the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) has asked for additional time to finish their review of the current resource allocation formula. ACRA will complete their work shortly and we intend to announce allocations for 2009-10 and 2010-11 by summer 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/5">As the House will recognise, the NHS has made substantial progress over the past 10 years of investment and reform. Patients wait no more than four hours in accident and emergency, the health service has more doctors and nurses than ever before; and we have witnessed the largest hospital building programme since the NHS was founded.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/6">As the NHS enters its 60th year, we must continue to drive forward with ever-greater determination, and so for the year ahead, the NHS has five principal priorities:</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/7" class="indent">first, improving standards of cleanliness and tackling healthcare associated infections;</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/8" class="indent">secondly, improving access to care through the achievement of the 18-week referral to treatment pledge and improving access to GP services, including at evenings and weekends;</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/9" class="indent">thirdly, adults and children well, improving their health and reducing inequalities, by focusing on improving care for cancer and stroke, and paying particular attention to children's health, particularly in the most deprived areas of the country;</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/10" class="indent">fourthly, improving patient experience, staff satisfaction and engagement; and</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/11" class="indent">fifthly, preparing to respond in a state of emergency, such as an outbreak of pandemic influenza.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/12">In addition to the national priorities, PCTs need to continue to improve at understanding the particular needs of their local populations and take concrete steps to address them. In order to meet their own local needs, PCTs will need to work in step with local government through local area agreements that focus on improving health and well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/13">Local priorities will build on evidence about current PCT performance and regional variation, and also plan for the future by incorporating work being done in local service reviews. Whether it is reducing mixed sex accommodation, personalising services for patients with learning disabilities or responding to the Healthcare Commission's recommendations, local services need to respond to local needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/14">Over the last 18 months, the NHS has continued to drive up the quality of care delivered to patients. This has been made possible by two significant achievements:</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/15" class="indent">bringing the NHS to financial balance and going on to deliver a surplus; and</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/16" class="indent">embedding patient choice, practice based commissioning, payment by results and foundation trusts, which all lead to better patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/17">In order to support this year's NHS Operating Framework, we must continue to develop the necessary structures and leadership in order to enable world class commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.4/18">The NHS must meet the needs of its patients and their families, the expectations of the public and the aspirations of its staff. At all times, the NHS must be safe, effective, personalised and fair. The more responsive and personalised the NHS gets, the better the care it will provide and the more confidence the health service will inspire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-13a.66WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" speakername="James Plaskitt" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions" colnum="66WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/wmstext/71213m0004.htm#07121366000942">
	<p pid="a.66WS.5/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December</phrase> in Brussels. I represented the UK, except for the items on the working time directive and the agency workers directive where the UK was represented by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Health and consumer affairs issues were taken on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.5/2">The Council failed to reach an agreement on the worker mobility directive on supplementary pensions. The area of concern for other delegations was the maximum length of the period before a worker's pension rights become unconditional. This will be taken forward by a future presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.5/3">There was also no agreement on the working time or temporary workers directives. The prospects for moving forward on these were discussed over lunch. Mr Hutton said the current working time text was a significant improvement on previous versions and whilst the UK still had some reservations, he believed that agreement was close. On agency workers, the presidency concluded&mdash;and member states agreed&mdash;that the text needed more work. The UK made it clear that it stood ready to support the presidency in future work to address outstanding issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.5/4">The European Commission said it would consider withdrawing both directives but this suggestion was opposed by most member states including the UK. The presidency concluded that progress had been made but further in-depth discussion was needed on both directives, with the aim of an early and broad consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.5/5">Agreement was reached on parts of an implementing regulation for social security co-ordination Regulation 883/04, specifically on the chapters covering administration of unemployment and family benefits and the corresponding parts of an annex to the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.5/6">The Council had a policy debate based on the recent Commission communication on services of general interest. I stressed, as did the majority of others that social services were important, both to individuals and more widely, and that quality was crucial. I also emphasised the need for subsidiarity and local and flexible delivery. While there was some common ground, the debate identified great diversity of situation and approach within and between member states and Ministers stressed the need for subsidiarity and exchange of experience and best practice. It was concluded that further work was needed in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.5/7">The Council adopted conclusions on flexicurity and endorsed a joint opinion of the Employment and Social Protection Committees on the subject. The Council also adopted conclusions and endorsed an Employment Committee opinion on future prospects for the European employment strategy in the context of the new cycle of the Lisbon strategy. The Council also adopted conclusions on active inclusion of people furthest from the labour market, women and poverty as part of the Beijing platform and on balanced roles for women and men as well as a resolution on follow-up to this year's European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.5/8">Slovenia outlined their priorities on employment and social policy for their forthcoming presidency starting in January, which will include &quot;Employment of the Young&quot;, &quot;Equal Opportunities&quot; and &quot;Demography&quot; as their three key presidency themes.</p>
