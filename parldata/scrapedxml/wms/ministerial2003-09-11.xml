	<p pid=".29WS.2/1">I am pleased to announce that the Government is today laying an Order before Parliament which will extend the Attorney-General's powers in relation to unduly lenient sentences. This will enable certain racially and religiously aggravated offences to be referred to the Court of Appeal for review where it is felt that under-sentencing has occurred. The Order will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-13">13 October 2003</phrase> and will apply to any sentence imposed after that date.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.2/2">This Order is being laid following a recommendation in the HM Crown Prosecution Service's Inspectorate Review of casework having a minority ethnic dimension that racially aggravated offences be included in the category of offences which can be referred under the unduly lenient sentencing provisions. The inclusion of religiously aggravated offences is necessary and logical to prevent anomalies in the protection offered to different groups. The Government will keep under review whether any further extensions should be made in future.</p>

	Draft Regional Planning Guidance (West Midlands)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-09-11.29WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" speakername="Keith Hill" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning" colnum="29WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030911/wmstext/30911m01.htm#30911m01.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".29WS.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is today publishing for public consultation Proposed Changes to the draft Regional Planning Guidance for the West Midlands (RPG11). They follow the Public Examination into draft RPG11 in June and July 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/2">The draft RPG was prepared and published by the Regional Planning Body (RPB). It provides a broad framework for the preparation of development plans and local development frameworks by the West Midlands local Planning authorities up to 2021. The overall strategy is to develop the major urban areas in such a way that they can increasingly meet their own economic and social needs in order to counter the unsustainable outward movement of people and jobs facilitated by previous strategies; address more effectively the major changes which are challenging the traditional roles of rural areas and the countryside; ensure that opportunities for growth are linked to meeting needs and that they help reduce social exclusion; and support the sustainable development of the region.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister support these aims, and as recommended by the panel, we are proposing changes to ensure the strategy is more clearly and succinctly expressed. It is important that the implications for development plans and other strategies are clear and unambiguous in order to make a real difference on the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/4">A key issue for the region is to bring about the urban renaissance of the major urban areas (MUAs) by creating a step change in urban regeneration processes and programmes. This is seen as essential to halt the drift of population to the surrounding shire areas. This objective, to encourage sustainable urban communities, is consistent with those of the communities plan (sustainable communities; building for the future).</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/5">The proposed changes support the draft RPG approach to housing provision. The major urban areas will increasingly meet their own housing needs, with reducing provision for migration to the surrounding shires and unitary areas. There is a transition from the former ratio of new housing development between the major urban areas and other areas of 1:2, through a position at 2007 where this is near 1:1, to 2011 where the ratio is in favour of the major urban areas.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/6">The panel considered the need for the western bypasses for Wolverhampton and Stourbridge to support draft RPG's spatial strategy was not demonstrated, and recommended that they should be deleted. Instead of the Study proposed by the RPB, the Panel recommended a much wider sub-regional study to resolve issues within the Black Country, including housing capacity, employment, land, scope for environmental and town centre improvements, and improvements to access to regeneration sites particularly on its eastern side. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has supported this recommendation in his announcement on the West Midlands area multi-Modal Study and the Proposed Changes reflect this.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/7">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister supports the panel's recommendation that Brierley Hill should not be included in the list of strategic town and city centres. However, he does not agree with the panel's recommendations on further retail development at Merry Hill, and has made it clear that any decisions on this issue will need to be made in the light of the RPB having decided its regional priorities for focusing retail, leisure and office development. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister considers that the future of Brierley Hill/Merry Hill should also be considered as part of the Black Country study referred to above. Any expansion of Merry Hill would be subject to transport improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/8">In considering these proposed changes and carrying out any future review of RPG 11 it is important that account is taken of the principles set out in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill (published <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-04">4 December 2002</phrase>), in particular the need to make RPG shorter and more strategic; more regionally specific; and more integrated and co-ordinated with other regional strategies; the increasing importance of introducing sub-regional policies within RPG's will also need to be addressed; and ensuring that the RPG process does not avoid making difficult decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/9">I have today written to the RPB with the proposed changes and indicating areas where views are particularly sought from any interested parties. There will now be a public consultation period on the proposed changes, which will end on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-12">12 December 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.5/10">Copies of the relevant documents are available in the Libraries of the House and have been provided for all of the region's MPs, MEPs, and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".31WS.2/1">In their report on the Criminal Justice Bill, the Home Affairs Select Committee invited the Government to consider the merits of repealing section 8 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 in order to permit meaningful research into how the jury system operates. This invitation followed from recommendations made by Lord Justice Auld in his Review of the criminal courts.</p>
	<p pid=".31WS.2/2">To fully consider this issue, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, intends to publish a consultation paper towards the end of autumn to look at whether or not we should allow jury research to be conducted.

	<p pid=".33WS.4/1">I am today publishing the Government's response to the ninth report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life &quot;Defining the Boundaries within the Executive: Ministers, special advisers and the permanent Civil Service&quot;. The Government has considered the Committee's report with great care, and I would like to place on record my thanks to the Committee for its thorough consideration of these issues. I am pleased to be able to announce the Government accepts the majority of the recommendations. Our response to the main recommendations is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/2" class="italic">Independent Ethics Adviser</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/3" class="indent">the Government agrees to the appointment of an independent adviser to provide Ministers and Permanent Secretaries with an additional source of professional advice as required on the handling of complex financial issues.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/4" class="italic">Civil Service Act</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/5" class="indent">the Government commits itself to publishing a draft bill for consultation once the Public Administration Select Committee's proposals for a Civil Service Act have been published. <i>Special advisers</i></p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/6" class="indent">the Government proposes a new section to the Code of Conduct for Special Advisers to clarify relationships between special advisers and permanent civil servants. An amendment to the Code is annexed to the Government's response.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/7" class="italic">First Civil Service Commissioner</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/8" class="indent">the Government agrees that, in future, the appointment of the First Civil Service Commissioner will be made following consultation with the Leaders of the main opposition parties. <i>Appointments</i></p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/9" class="indent">the response makes clear that the Government is committed to maintaining a permanent and impartial Civil Service where selection is made on merit on the basis of fair and open competition. It also acknowledges the important role of the Civil Service Commissioners in the recruitment processes and in upholding the core values of the Civil Service. The response commits the Government to discussions with the Civil Service Commissioners to consider whether the different approaches to Civil Service and public appointments continue to be justified.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.4/10">Copies of the Government's response [Cm5964] have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".34WS.2/1">Today I am announcing the result of collaborative work with the voluntary and community sector to design the futurebuilders fund.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/2">I am publishing the final report on the fund, following consultation, along with a summary leaflet. I am also publishing a consultation report, which contains the key messages from the consultation. Copies of all three documents are being made available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/3">These reports are being published jointly with the Compact Working Group, reflecting the fact that the voluntary and community sector has been central in shaping the fund.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/4">Futurebuilders will invest in voluntary and community organisations, and social enterprises, to assist them in their public service work. It will enable organisations to modernise their operations so that they can increase the scale and scope of their public service delivery. It is targeted at organisations working in or across the service areas of health and social care; crime; community cohesion; education and learning; and support for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/5">The fund will provide finance to acquire capital assets, through a range of funding solutions, including grants and different forms of loans. Advice and support will also be available to organisations to help them in accessing the fund.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/6">The manager(s) of the fund will be appointed through open competition. Advertisements are being placed this week seeking expressions of interest.</p>
