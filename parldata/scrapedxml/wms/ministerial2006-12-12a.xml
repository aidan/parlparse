<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-12-12a.77WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" speakername="David Miliband" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="77WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061212/wmstext/61212m0001.htm#06121257000083">
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/1">In my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-11-01.19WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 19WS</phrase>, I said that I would keep the House informed about developments on contingency arrangements for rural development funding delivery. These are necessary because of delays, for reasons utterly beyond our control, to the start of the next Rural Development Programme in England, originally due for <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/2">As explained in my earlier statement our programme, which will deliver important environmental, economic and social benefits in rural England, is dependent upon a new European Voluntary Modulation regulation which is still subject to a consultation procedure with the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/3">Our aim is to minimise any disruption caused by this delay. We have indicated that we want to keep as near as possible to business as usual for those existing rural development schemes that will continue under the next programme. But we have to take account of the legal and financial issues. Given the changes to the legal basis for the next Programme under the new Rural Development Regulation, our own policy priorities and the ongoing uncertainties over approval, we need to take a prudent approach. For some elements of the programme we shall need to continue our discussions with the EU Commission before we make funding available.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/4">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>, Environmental Stewardship (Entry Level, Organic Entry Level and Higher Level) will remain open to new applications. Successful applicants will be informed that their agreements are provisional. This means that agreements might have to be amended in the light of any changes caused by the EU approval process. However, we do not anticipate any major changes because the schemes were approved in 2005 under the current England Rural Development Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/5">The Hill Farm Allowance will also continue in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/6">The English Woodland Grant Scheme will remain open to new applications. It is unlikely that contracts will be issued until Programme approval is confirmed, but this will be kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/7">Under the Energy Crops Scheme there are significant energy crop plantings planned in 2007, which have been carried forward from the existing programme. It is our intention to continue to support energy crop planting under the next Rural Development Programme. Although we will not be able to accept new applications from January, we expect to be in a position to accept applications under the new in summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/8">Responsibility for commitments to socio-economic projects made under the current programme passed to the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October</phrase> this year. This means that the RDAs expect to spend about &pound;34 million between now and October 2008 on ongoing commitments. However, the RDAs will not be able to enter into any new commitments in advance of approval, although they will continue to work with rural businesses to discuss potential future projects. We will keep this approach under review as discussions with the EU Commission proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.77WS.5/9">Further details about what these arrangements mean for our customers will be available on the DEFRA website, and from our delivery partners for the next Programme: Natural England, the Forestry Commission and the RDAs.</p>

	<p pid="a.81WS.2/1">Today the Government have published new regulations transposing the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directives 2002/96/EC and 2003/108/EC in the UK&mdash;the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/2">Electronic and electrical equipment is the fastest growing waste stream in Europe. The UK alone produced over 2 million tonnes in 2005. The Directive has the laudable aim of reducing the amount of WEEE sent to landfill by promoting its separate collection, treatment and recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/3">From <phrase class="date" code="">1 July 2007</phrase>, the WEEE regulations will make all producers, importers, and those selling EEE under their own brand, in the UK market, responsible for financing its treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/4">THe regulations published today have been the subject of extensive public consultation to ensure all interested parties have been able to present their views and concerns as the regulations were developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/5">The regulations will:</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/6" class="indent">Achieve the environmental aims of the WEEE Directive while continuing to support the important and dynamic electrical and electronic sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/7" class="indent">Provide effective and robust protection of the environment and a positive contribution to sustainable development from the increasing volumes of electrical and electronic equipment used in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/8" class="indent">Allow existing relationships currently managing WEEE to continue. This is consistent with the Government's overall approach to regulation, which is to be as 'light-touch' as possible and to minimise 'red tape' burdens.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/9" class="indent">Give distributors the choice of discharging their obligations by either joining the distributor take-back scheme (DTS) or by offering customers in-store take-back.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/10" class="indent">Enable any operator of a designated collection facility (DCF) to arrange with a producer compliance scheme (PCS) to have the WEEE deposited at their site taken away for treatment and recycling by that PCS, free of charge. If relationships cannot be developed the operator of the DCF can arrange the treatment and recycling themselves and their costs be reimbursed via an exchange and settlement process.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/11" class="indent">Support the re-use of whole equipment after it has been discarded by the consumer or business end-user. It provides encouragement to the further re-use of whole equipment by requiring producer compliance schemes to work with the re-use sector to prioritise the re-use of whole equipment where this is possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/12" class="indent">Allow the collection-on-delivery of old equipment for new equipment undertaken by retailers, and some producers, to continue in the UK in the future. Collection-on-delivery is valued by consumers for the convenience it brings in enabling them to discard of old equipment. The WEEE regulations also allows WEEE collected by local authorities as part of their 'bulky waste collections' to continue in the future, as well as WEEE collected by the voluntary and charitable sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/13" class="indent">Enable consumers to dispose of their WEEE free of charge at accessible and appropriate places. People who dispose of their WEEE in this way will know that they will be contributing to protection of the environment, reductions in greenhouse gases and higher levels of sustainable development in the UK and in the world more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.81WS.2/14">As part of the last public consultation, I set out our desire to introduce partial producer responsibility from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> to ensure that producers were obligated to cover the costs of collection, treatment and recycling of EEE containing hazardous substances (for example CRTs, refrigerants and gas discharge lamps. The Government are planning to adopt this approach and I will be making an announcement shortly about the mechanism for doing so.</p>

	<p pid="a.82WS.2/1">I have published a consultation paper seeking views on the European Maritime Green Paper&mdash;&quot;Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union: A European vision for the Oceans and Sea&quot;&mdash;the EU Maritime Green Paper&quot; 11510/06 published by the European Commission <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June 2006</phrase>. The EU Maritime Green Paper is a wide ranging discussion document, intended by the Commission to stimulate debate about the future direction and focus of Community maritime policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.2/2">The responses, together with input from the recent UK stakeholder conference on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-12">12 October</phrase> will inform the UK Government's response to the Commission. It is important that all UK maritime interests have an opportunity to reflect on the document and comment as the European Commission intends to develop formal proposals based on the outcome of a Europe-wide consultation and it is vital that the UK has a strong, informed voice in this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.2/3">Further information on the consultation and the Maritime Green Paper are available from the DfT website: <a href="http://www.dft.gov">www.dft.gov</a>.uk<a href="http://www.dtf.gov.uk/">www.dtf.gov.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.82WS.2/4">Those wishing to comment on the proposals have until <phrase class="date" code="">28 February 2007</phrase> to do so. Copies of the consultation paper are in the House Libraries.</p>
