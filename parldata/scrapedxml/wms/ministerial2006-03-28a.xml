	<p pid="a.51WS.2/1">My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor, has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/2" class="indent">&quot;On <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>, I will launch the Tribunals Service. The new agency brings together the tribunals already administered by DCA with five others from across central Government. It is the culmination of a major programme of work that has involved extensive engagement with tribunals, other Government Departments and stakeholders to ensure a seamless transition and minimal disruption to users. The formation of the agency is the first major shake-up of the UK tribunals system for over fifty years and will ensure the manifest independence of the tribunals from those whose decisions they are reviewing.</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/3" class="indent">The Tribunals Service will work to make the whole system of administrative justice more efficient, effective and accessible for users. Over time, it will test a range of methods of dispute resolution to create a service that ensures the public can get their problems addressed by the most suitable means.</p>
	<p pid="a.51WS.2/4" class="indent">The following table sets out the key performance targets which I have set for the Tribunals Service for 2006&ndash;07:</p>

	<p pid="a.55WS.2/1">I have today placed in the Library of the House the structured plan for the phased reduction of troops to peacetime levels, assuming the continued maintenance of an enabling environment, which the Government agreed to produce as part of the programme for security normalisation in Northern Ireland announced last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.2/2">Tranche 1 of the plan has been completed ahead of schedule, including the removal of the three hilltop observation posts, the dismantling of the military supersanger in Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Newtonhamilton and the removal of the military observation posts in Masonic Base and on Divis Tower. Forkhill has been vacated and closed, and the Army has withdrawn from the PSNI stations at Kinawley and Rosslea. The six month roulement Battalion known as Northern Ireland Battalion 1 (NIBAT 1) was withdrawn from Northern Ireland on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-16">16 January</phrase>. This marked the withdrawal of the last roulement Battalion deployed in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.2/3">We shall be consulting with the trades unions on the implementation of this plan once the full impact of the normalisation programme on civilian staff has been established.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-28a.55WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government" colnum="55WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/wmstext/60328m02.htm#60328m02.html_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/1">My statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-02">2 December 2005</phrase> set out the process by which the Government proposed to amend the local government pension scheme in England and Wales, subject to the outcome of the statutory consultation exercise which began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase> and which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase>. A summary of the responses received will be placed on the ODPM/LGPS website.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/2">The local government pensions scheme is a guaranteed, final salary pension scheme open primarily to employees of local government but also to those who work in other organisations associated with local government, including, higher and further education institutions. It is also a funded scheme, with its pensions funds being managed and invested locally within the framework of regulations provided by Government. In deciding on the regulations needed to ensure that all members' pensions are safe, and prudently funded, the Government have to take account of the advice of actuaries, as well as the views of representatives of employers and members, and other interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/3">My <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase> statement made clear the Government's intention to secure the scheme's continued affordability and viability, without placing an unfair burden on taxpayers. The Government remain committed to that objective, and also to providing an equality-proofed scheme which is flexible and attractive in its provisions to employees and employers, both now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/4">To fulfil the Government's objective for the scheme, considerable efforts have been made to reform and to plan its future, within the framework provided by the Tripartite Committee. The Government, with the cooperation of the local authority employers and trades unions, want to see the provision of good quality pensions for all local authority workers. The Tripartite Committee provides the right framework for key interests to seek agreement, through analysis and transparent discussions, on the way ahead for the scheme and for any new benefit structure. However, in regulating the scheme, the Government are required by the scheme's governing regulations to secure its on-going solvency and compliance with the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/5">It is intended to place before Parliament the necessary amending regulations to implement what was outlined in my <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase> statement. These will introduce significant and well supported flexibilities into the scheme's legal framework to reflect the simplified tax regime provided by the Finance Act 2004. It is the Government's wish also to strike a fair and proportionate balance between the extent and the cost of any affordable and legal safeguards for existing scheme members. To ensure compliance with European Union age discrimination legislation, set out in Council directive 2000/78/EC, and to secure ongoing cost stability, the rule of 85 will be removed from the Scheme with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase>. We remain firmly committed to ensuring the protection of those members born before <phrase class="date" code="1953-03-31">31 March 1953</phrase> who would have satisfied the rule by their 60th birthday.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/6">Such an approach, within the current scheme's framework, is seen as being both affordable and legal, and it maintains the consistent stance taken by the Government that no additional costs associated with these regulations should fall on taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/7">Looking ahead, the Government are committed to reforming the scheme to ensure it meets the challenge of a changing workforce both within and around local government in England and Wales. Discussions with scheme interests are proceeding to support the preparation of a policy discussion paper on a new-look scheme for consultation later in the year. Any reforms of the scheme must recognise, of course, that it already has a normal retirement age of 65, that it is funded and financed in a specific way and, crucially, that any new arrangements must continue to be both affordable and legal.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/8">A key element of these discussions, which have already begun within the framework provided by the Tripartite Committee, will be to address positively the concerns expressed about the position of existing scheme members who contrast their particular circumstances with the agreement reached in October 2005 by other, but unfunded, public service pension schemes. The Government intend that these reforms can be guided by the principle that up to half of the savings achieved by the final removal of the rule of 85 can be recycled into the development of whatever benefit package is felt by the stakeholders and membership to be appropriate for the new-look 2008 scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.5/9">Going forward, the Government, given their regulatory responsibilities for the solvency and viability of the scheme, remain firmly committed to the provision of affordable and sustainable, good quality pension arrangements in the local government pension scheme, as indeed it believes so too are all the interested parties connected with its present and future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-28a.61WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="61WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060328/wmstext/60328m04.htm#60328m04.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-17">17 November 2005</phrase> I made a statement about developments at Styal prison following the tragic series of deaths of six women there and further work planned relating to women offenders. I outlined in that statement a great deal of work that is underway in respect of women who come into contact with the Criminal Justice System, in particular, changes made at Styal and other women's prisons and the Women's Offending Reduction Programme (WORP), which is co-ordinating and implementing a comprehensive programme of work to address the complex range of factors that affect women's offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/2">I said that it was timely to take stock of the work being done and to look again at the measures in place to ensure that we are doing everything possible for the especially vulnerable group of women who come into contact with the criminal justice system. I undertook to make a further announcement when the scope of this review had been determined and I am now able to make that further announcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/3">I am pleased to announce that Baroness Jean Corston has agreed to undertake this review. Jean recently chaired the Joint Committee on Human Rights and instigated its valuable and comprehensive Inquiry into Deaths in Custody in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/4">The review will be focused on those women in whom a multitude of risk factors coexist and which could lead them to harm themselves in prison. This could, for example, encompass women with serious mental illness or serious drug addictions; women with other mental health problems such as personality disorder, which can be exacerbated by prison and increase their vulnerability; and those women who are persistent low-level offenders, living chaotic lives. It will look at provision for such women at each occasion they come into contact with the criminal justice system, for example, at police stations, at court, on remand, on sentencing, during sentence in the community, in prison and on release.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/5">I stress that the review will complement rather than replicate the work underway and will seek to build on the vast amount of work and knowledge that already exist. For example, WORP aims to provide a more appropriate and joined-up response in the community to the particular factors that impact on women offenders. The Together Women Programme will trial an integrated approach to routing women to appropriate services to meet their needs at various stages of their offending history. Baroness Corston's review will seek to build on this work, focusing on identified gaps in provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/6">Part of the review will profile the characteristics and histories of some of the women who have died in custody in recent years (particularly those at Styal) and look at the pathway through the criminal justice system that led them to that point. It is hoped that some of those families sadly bereaved by these deaths might be willing to share their experiences with the review and provide an insight into the events that led to custody. This element of the review could provide a strong contribution to learning lessons and may be of some small comfort to those bereaved families.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/7">The review will be assisted by a small advisory reference group, with some wider groups and themed seminars. Baroness Corston is establishing her advisory group, which is likely to include, for example, Prison Reform Trust, Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, Women in Prison, INQUEST and NIMHE. Senior officials from the Home Office Women's Offending Reduction Programme, the Prison Service Women's group and the National Offender Management Service Safer Custody Group will also sit on the reference group. A wider group of people and organisations, whose expertise will be vital to the review, will also be invited to contribute both directly and through meetings and seminars. Many other individuals and organisations with specialist knowledge are being identified and will also be invited to contribute to the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/8">My right hon. Friend Baroness Scotland has asked Baroness Corston for a progress report by the end of June 2006 and for her final report to reach us by <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2006</phrase>. The final report will be published.</p>
