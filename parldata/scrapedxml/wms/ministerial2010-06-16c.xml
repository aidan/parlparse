	Bilateral Aid Review

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-06-16c.51WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40595" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for International Development" colnum="51WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100616/wmstext/100616m0001.htm#10061669000012">
	<p pid="c.51WS.2/1">The Government will honour the commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid from 2013. We are determined to ensure that this vital and important aid budget is used effectively and delivers value for money for the world's poorest people. In this context I would like to inform the House that I have commissioned a review of the DFID Bilateral Aid Programme to ensure that we target UK aid where it is needed most and will make the most significant impact on poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="c.51WS.2/2">The review will consider which countries should receive British aid, how much they should receive and which countries should stop receiving British aid. It will also consider which aid instruments are most effective at delivering poverty reduction in different contexts. Any savings generated will be redirected to more effective programmes in other poor countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.51WS.2/3">I look forward to sharing the full results of the review with the House when it is completed.</p>

	<p pid="c.52WS.2/1">A review of drink and drug driving regulation was commissioned by the then Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-03">3 December 2009</phrase>, to be undertaken by Sir Peter North. Sir Peter's final report has been published today. This report covers a wide range of issues and makes 51 detailed recommendations, which we need to consider carefully with other Government Departments. In doing so, it is important that we fully investigate the economic and public service resource impact of any suggested changes to the law, taking account of the current financial and economic situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.52WS.2/2">Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
