<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-14a.13WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" speakername="Derek Twigg" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="13WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070314/wmstext/70314m0001.htm#07031479000060">
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">19 July</phrase> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" name="Tom Watson">my predecessor, the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson)</phrase>, announced the publication of an independent report on the errors made in administering the Government's ex-gratia payment scheme for former far east prisoners of war and civilian internees. The report prepared by Mr. David Watkins was based on a detailed and thorough investigation of how inconsistent criteria came to be used in deciding payments to former civilian internees; this included consultation with the key affected parties. At the time of its publication, the Government welcomed the report and made clear that they would take time to consider further the detail of the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/2">In responding to the report, the Ministry of Defence has consulted with the other Departments responsible both for developing and implementing the scheme in 2000-01, and for now providing guidance on the development of new policy. We have also consulted with the representative organisation for civilian internees, ABCIFER, and with the parliamentary ombudsman. The report made some 13 recommendations. Steps had already been taken since 2000 that address many of the shortcomings. These occurred quite independently, as part of the Government's work on better regulation and better policy making. Nevertheless, the recent reshaping of the FEPOW scheme in particular was able to benefit from the emerging recommendations and we are doing work to take them into account in the wider context of a wider review of the Department's guidance on policy making.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/3">I have today placed in the Library of the House our detailed response to David Watkins' recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/4">I would like to thank Mr. Watkins for his thorough investigation and comprehensive report and to acknowledge the major role played by the parliamentary ombudsman and Public Administration Select Committee in scrutinising the administration of the scheme and helping us to identify and resolve the errors within it. Finally, I would like to give credit again to Ron Bridge, the chairman of ABCIFER, for the enormous amount of painstaking work he has put into the process.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-14a.13WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" speakername="Des Browne" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="13WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070314/wmstext/70314m0001.htm#07031479000061">
	<p pid="a.13WS.4/1">I am pleased to announce that, on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase>, the RAF's Personnel and Training Command and Strike Command will merge to form a single Air Command, with its headquarters at RAF High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. The creation of a single command, with a single fully integrated headquarters, will better equip the RAF to provide a coherent and co-ordinated single air focus to the other services, MOD Head Office, the Permanent Joint Headquarters and the rest of MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.4/2">Over the past five years the RAF has undertaken a significant amount of restructuring to improve delivery, reduce bureaucracy and eliminate waste. This has centred on force structure adjustments, estate rationalisation and logistics transformation. One element of this work focused on headquarters rationalisation and resulted in the collocation of Headquarters Personnel and Training Command and Headquarters Strike Command at RAF High Wycombe in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.4/3">The success of this work, which resulted in a reduction of some 1,000 posts across the two command headquarters and annual savings of some &pound;23 million, has enabled these resources to be better directed towards the delivery of support to the front line. The next step in this work is the creation of a single Air Command which reflects the continued commitment of the Government to ensuring that resources are focused on the front line. The recent draw down of personnel for collocation means, however, that the creation of a single Air Command is unlikely to lead to any manpower reductions.</p>

	<p pid="a.16WS.2/1">I am pleased to announce that there will be no increase in the General Levy rates for the Pensions Regulator for 2007-08. Rates will remain at the 2005-06 level as set out in the table below.</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.2/2">The General Levy meets the cost of the Pensions Regulator whose objective is to protect the benefits of members of occupational and private pension schemes; to reduce risks that lead to calls on the Pension Protection Fund and to promote and improve understanding of, the good administration of work based pension schemes. It also meets the cost of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Pensions Advisory Service which provide scheme members with help, advice and information.</p>
