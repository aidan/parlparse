	<p pid=".81WS.5/1">Today, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is publishing the 2004&ndash;05 fire and rescue national framework.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.5/2">The Government have ambitious targets for the Fire and Rescue Service. Our overriding aim is to save more lives and stop unnecessary injuries through more effective action to prevent fires and by ensuring that the Fire and Rescue Service is well prepared and equipped to respond to the many challenges it faces. That is why we announced, as part of this year's spending review, a new public service agreement that commits us to achieving long-term reductions in fire deaths and deliberate fires, including real progress in the most disadvantaged areas. This builds on the commitments set out in the June 2003 White Paper &quot;Our Fire and Rescue Service&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.5/3">The national framework sets out the strategy for meeting these objectives and delivering an improved service that achieves better value for money for the communities it serves.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.5/4">The Government published a draft version of the national framework for consultation in December 2003. The response to the draft was overwhelmingly positive. The majority of those who responded supported the Government's objectives and the modernisation programme. We have taken on board many of the useful comments and suggestions we received. As a result, the national framework sets out a shared strategy. It recognises that the Government and fire and rescue authorities must work in partnership to achieve our shared goals. We are also publishing a consultation response today, on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at: <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/fire">www.odpm.gov.uk/fire</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.5/5">The national framework has also been updated to reflect progress on modernisation, including the replacement of outdated national standards with new local risk management plans and the establishment of regional management boards, which will help to deliver many functions more efficiently and effectively. The expectations of fire and rescue authorities set out in the national framework will be central to the Audit Commission's assessment of the performance of authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.5/6">Future versions of the national framework will be published in the autumn, to enable fire and rescue authorities to take full account of the national framework in their annual budgeting process. We will therefore start the consultation on the 2005&ndash;06 national framework shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.5/7">The Fire and Rescue Services Bill is currently before Parliament. If enacted it will give statutory force to the framework.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.5/8">Copies of the 2004&ndash;05 fire and rescue national framework are available in the Libraries of the House and are also available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at: <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/fire">www.odpm.gov.uk/fire</a>.</p>

	Regional Transport Strategy (South-East)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-07-16.82WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" speakername="Keith Hill" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning" colnum="82WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040716/wmstext/40716m01.htm#40716m01.html_spmin2">
	<p pid=".82WS.1/1">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is today publishing the regional transport strategy (RTS) for the south-east. This follows the public examination into the draft RTS in July 2003, the panel report in October 2003, and the consultation on the Secretary of State's proposed changes that closed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-21">21 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/2">RTSs are an integral part of regional planning guidance (RPG) and the RTS for the south-east represents a revision to RPG9, as published in March 2001. On commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, the RTS will be part of a statutory regional spatial strategy (RSS).</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/3">Other partial reviews of RPG9 are at various stages in the process. In particular, the public examination into the Milton Keynes and south Midlands sub-regional strategy has taken place and we are now awaiting the panels report and the consultation on the Secretary of State's proposed changes for the Ashford growth area has recently closed.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/4">The RTS aims to achieve a transport system which progressively reaches the standards of the best in north-west Europe, by promoting management of and investment in the system; rebalancing the structure and use of the transport system in favour of more sustainable modes; and supporting the regional spatial strategy, particularly managing and investing in interregional corridors and delivering urban renaissance and sub-regional objectives. This approach should also inform local authorities and other agencies in preparing relevant regional and local strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/5">The consultation period for the proposed changes to the draft RTS ended on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-21">21 May</phrase> with some 300 responses from individuals or organisations. The majority of responses sought changes to specific policies within the RTS. Many of the points raised, particularly by individuals, concerned local issues.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/6">From the 718 individual comments received, the policies and matters which received most comment were:</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/7" class="indent">244 comments supporting the re-instatement of the Lewes/Uckfield rail link.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/8" class="indent">30 comments supporting the reintroduction of the regional frame.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/9" class="indent">27 comments on the investment tables, mostly on clarity or calls for higher priority.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/10" class="indent">17 comments on matters relating to accuracy and clarity of the maps.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/11">In light of the level of interest revealed by responses supporting the Lewes/Uckfield rail line reinstatement, a reference to this proposal has been included in the supporting text relating the project to the development of the south-east plan.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/12">The calls to reinstate the regional frame mainly restate the arguments put forward at the public examination, and in consequence the earlier decision to delete the regional frame, as recommended by the independent panel, is not changed.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/13">For accuracy, to take account of recent changes to programmes, and in the light of further information about scheme details and promoters intentions, a number of changes have been made to the investment framework tables and maps.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/14">The RTS is an integral and clearly identifiable part of RPG9. It will be reviewed through the development of the spatial strategy for the south-east, resulting in the publication of the south-east plan in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.1/15">Copies of the relevant documents are available in the Libraries of the House and have been provided for all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>

	Degree Awarding Powers and University Title Criteria

	<p pid=".83WS.2/1">I made a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-16">16 March</phrase> about the results of the consultation on the proposed new criteria for degree awarding powers (DAP) and university title (UT) which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-12">12 December</phrase>. We then consulted further in May on the following options for degree awarding powers:</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/2" class="indent">Probationary DAP followed by indefinite DAP.</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/3" class="indent">Indefinite DAP for organisations in the publicly funded higher education sector and fixed degree awarding powers for other organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/4">This consultation ended on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-25">25 June</phrase>. There was overwhelming support for option 2, with just a few respondents expressing preference for neither option or for option 1. I have placed a copy of the consultation report in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament, and it is available on the DfES website at: <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/consultations/conResults.cfm?consultationId=1226">http://www.dfes. gov.uk/consultations/conResults.cfm?consultationId=1226</a></p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/5">In light of the results of both consultations, the Government have decided in relation to England:</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/6" class="indent">to modernise the criteria for the granting of degree awarding powers to make it easier for non-traditional higher education organisations to apply&mdash;along the lines set out in the original consultation document;</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/7" class="indent">to make degree awarding powers for organisations in the publicly funded higher education sector indefinite and fixed for other organisations, subject to satisfactory external quality audit;</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/8" class="indent">to grant university title on the basis of taught degree awarding powers and student numbers (which remain at current levels); and</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/9" class="indent">to remove the requirement that institutions must have students in five subject areas to be eligible for university title (this will allow institutions specialising in one subject area to become universities).</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/10">We believe that these changes strike the right balance between our concern to modernise the criteria for both degree awarding powers and university title, with the concerns that emerged during both consultations.</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/11">The detailed revised criteria for England will be published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-01">1 September</phrase> and the moratorium on new applications for DAPs from English institutions will be lifted on the same date. The moratorium on new applications for university title under the current criteria remains lifted.</p>

	Prostitution (Public Consultation)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-07-16.84WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/739" speakername="David Blunkett" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="84WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040716/wmstext/40716m02.htm#40716m02.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".84WS.2/1">&quot;Paying the Price: A Public Consultation Paper on Prostitution&quot; was published today. Copies have been placed in the Library and are available from the Home Office website at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/inside/consults/index">http://www. homeoffice.gov.uk/inside/consults/index</a></p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/2">Prostitution can have devastating consequences for those involved and for the wider community. It involves the abuse of children and the serious exploitation of adults. Violence and problematic drug use are common features and there are increasing links with trafficking and other types of organised crime. This consultation paper is the starting point for the development of a realistic and coherent strategy to deal with prostitution and its serious detrimental consequences for individuals and communities.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/3">The paper seeks examples of innovative and effective ways to prevent the circumstances that make young people vulnerable to coercion into prostitution. Around 70 per cent. of those involved in prostitution started at a young age. Exploring the role for schools and considering ways to support those families where children and teenagers are vulnerable to coercion are key questions on which the paper seeks views.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/4">The paper also asks questions about the delivery of justice. The prosecution of child abusers and exploiters is the best way to protect vulnerable people. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 began the process of law reform with the introduction of new offences and tough penalties for those who exploit anyone for the purposes of prostitution or pornography. The new measures in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 must be rigorously enforced, and an intelligence-based approach to investigations developed, if we are to combat the stranglehold of pimps and break the links between prostitution and drugs markets, trafficking and other areas of organised crime. The paper sets out examples of good investigative practice and describes the new measures in the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill which will strengthen the protection for those abused by their pimp partners. The paper lays out experiences across the world and encourages further examples of good practice to be provided during the consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/5">The civil and criminal law, along with environmental measures, is also considered in the paper. Communities suffer from the harassment of local residents, from noise and litter, and from the antisocial behaviour and criminality that is often associated with street prostitution. There are key questions to be addressed on how communities, through crime and disorder reduction partnerships and other forums can be given help and advice on developing effective preventative measures and support to safeguard their neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/6">Law reform is a crucial first step but it is widely recognised that enforcement alone is not the complete answer. Support for those trapped in exploitation through prostitution is also crucial. Providing a route out is the best long-term solution for those involved and for the communities that suffer from the nuisance and criminality associated with prostitution. The paper asks questions about the way in which protection and support can be provided most effectively. Also published today is a Home Office research study report, &quot;Tackling Street Prostitution: Towards an Holistic Approach&quot; which draws out good practice from eleven Crime Reduction Programme pilot projects. The challenge for the provision of effective exit strategies is for local services to work together to address the whole spectrum of issues faced by individuals trapped in prostitution. This often includes the need for drug treatment, advice and treatment for other health needs, housing, education and employment opportunities. The paper seeks views on how this can best be achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/7">Members of the House are invited to contribute to the review with information on how prostitution has affected individuals and their families, and local communities in their constituencies, and with examples of how prevention, protection and support, and the delivery of justice have been tackled. Consultation will be open for four months during which time my Department will be arranging discussion opportunities on all these issues with a wide range of key stakeholders, including those directly involved in prostitution. It is important to hear the views of all those with an interest in this complex and sensitive area, and the paper contains a set of key questions for consideration. Responses from Members of this House, and from the wider public, will enable positive local experiences to feed into the development of a clear and coherent national strategy to achieve, and sustain, a real impact on the issues arising from prostitution.</p>

	<p pid=".86WS.2/1">As part of the Government's continuing commitment to investigate Gulf veterans' illnesses openly and honestly, data on the mortality of veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict are regularly published. The most recent figures for the period <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-01">1 April 1991</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>, were published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-14">14 July 2004</phrase>. The tables from that publication are set out below. Table 1 gives the causes of death to UK Gulf veterans over that period; table 2 shows the deaths due to malignant cancers among Gulf veterans. As with previous information, the data for Gulf veterans are compared to that of a control group known as the Era cohort which is made up of Armed Forces personnel of a similar age, gender, service, regular/reservist status and rank who were not deployed to the Gulf.</p>
	<p pid=".86WS.2/2">Key points to note are:</p>
	<p pid=".86WS.2/3" class="indent">there were 663 deaths among Gulf veterans up to <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase> compared to 675 in the Era comparison group; and</p>
	<p pid=".86WS.2/4" class="indent">approximately 1,032 deaths would have been expected in a similar sized group taken from the general population of the UK with the same age and gender profile.</p>

	<p pid=".87WS.2/1">The overall payment performance of Government is 96.68 per cent. Figures for the financial year 2003&ndash;04 show that there has been a slight improvement on last year's figure. There has been a continued improvement in the payment performance of a number of Departments and agencies, with 20 achieving the average or above, and 24 improving on their performance of last year.</p>
	<p pid=".87WS.2/2">Government Departments and their agencies are required to monitor their payment performance and to publish the results in their departmental or annual reports. The table lists, by Department, the proportion of bills paid within 30 days, or other agreed credit period, on receipt of a valid invoice.</p>
	<p pid=".87WS.2/3">The Government take this issue very seriously and are committed to improving the payment culture in the UK. In order to create fair and stable business transactions, the Government's own payment performance is an important element in this policy.</p>

</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-07-16.89WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1186" speakername="John Reid" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health" colnum="89WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040716/wmstext/40716m03.htm#40716m03.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".89WS.2/1">We are committed to rebuilding National Health Service dentistry to ensure better access to NHS dental care and to improve oral health in England. We want to see a better deal for patients, dentists and the NHS. We are aware that in some areas it can still be difficult, especially for adults, to access NHS dental care.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/2">There are over 19,000 dentists in primary care, which is more than ever before. But they are spending less time on their NHS work, which leaves some people unable to get the routine treatment they want on the NHS unless they are prepared and able to travel.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/3">We have already announced funding of &pound;59 million to tackle access problems and have set up an NHS support team to work with the hardest pressed areas. However we recognise that more needs to be done and that is why I am today outlining the Government's plans to recruit more NHS dentists in the short term, to invest in dentistry and to reform the system for the long-term benefit of the oral health of the people of England.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/4">To address short-term access problems we will recruit the equivalent of over an additional 1,000 whole time NHS dentists by October 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/5">This objective will be achieved by a range of measures:</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/6" class="indent">securing extra NHS capacity from dentists who currently work partly in the NHS and partly in private practice;</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/7" class="indent">attracting dentists back from career breaks and flexible working;</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/8" class="indent">an international recruitment programme, already under way targeting dentists from the European Union, including the new accession countries;</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/9" class="indent">clearing the backlog of dentists waiting to sit the international qualifying exam by December 2004&mdash;to allow dentists who have qualified outside the EU to practise here.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/10">In addition, NHS dentistry will benefit from extra investment:</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/11" class="indent">We will fund 170 extra undergraduate training places in England from October 2005. This 25 per cent increase will be supported by capital investment of up to &pound;80 million over four years with the first &pound;20 million available in 2005&ndash;06 and revenue costs which will reach &pound;29 million per annum by 2010&ndash;11;</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/12" class="indent">funding for dentistry will increase by 19.3 per cent (excluding the impact of additional superannuation costs) in 2005&ndash;06 compared to spending on dentistry in 2003&ndash;04. This compares with growth of 17.8 per cent in overall NHS revenue resources over the same two year period. At October 2005 the government will be investing &pound;1.6 billion in dentistry (including &pound;50 million superannuation costs) compared to &pound;1.3 billion in 2003&ndash;04;</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/13" class="indent">financial resources for primary dental services will be devolved to Primary Care Trusts from <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">1 October 2005</phrase>. The financial year 2004&ndash;05 will be a preparatory year and we will be consulting PCTs now on indicative financial allocations for dentistry for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06, as well as issuing proposed 2005 contract values for dentists, based on their most recent gross earnings.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/14">The additional investment will provide a sound foundation on which PCTs can rebuild a NHS dental service fit for the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/15">Long-term change is also required to modernise the dentistry profession and this is why we are:</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/16" class="indent"><i>introducing new contracts for dentists</i>. We have already made legislative changes. The measures in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 represent the most radical reform of NHS dentistry since 1948. Our proposals for NHS dentistry will underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service provided through contracts between PCTs and dental practices. The service will be properly integrated with the rest of the NHS providing better access to services and an improved patient experience.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/17" class="indent">We have already made considerable progress on implementation. We have consulted widely with representatives of the profession on the framework proposed for the new primary dental services. A recurrent theme from</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/18" class="indent">the consultation is that time is too short for our planned implementation date of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. The British Dental Association asked for phased implementation. I have therefore concluded that we should give more time to the NHS and to dentists to prepare for these significant changes and I am also announcing today that the new arrangements will be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">1 October 2005</phrase>, rather than <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. In recognition of the additional work and training dentists and their practice staff will need to prepare for these changes we will make available an extra &pound;9 million to help dental practices prepare for October 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/19" class="indent">The new arrangements are modelled on five years successful experience of personal dental services (PDS) pilots. The PDS continues to provide an opportunity for those dentists and their PCTs who wish to move further and faster towards local commissioning to do so. There are already more than 1,500 dentists in more than 750 practices working under PDS arrangements, out of a total of around 9,000 practices. With this in mind, I am asking PCTs to encourage dental practices to notify PCTs of their intention to move early to local commissioning under existing piloting arrangements. We will shortly publish additional guidance for dentists and PCTs to streamline this conversion process&mdash;with a 12 week turnaround time from application to approval.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/20" class="indent"><i>using the skills of the whole dental team more appropriately&mdash;</i>so that hygienists and therapists provide more routine and preventative care. I have already invested an additional &pound;5 million to increase the number of training places for dental therapists from just 50 to 200. Some of those new training places are already on stream, and the first of the additional therapists will be joining the workforce in autumn 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/21" class="indent"><i>looking into simplifying the system of patient charges</i>. The NHS dentistry patient charges working group, which involved experts from national patient, consumer and dentist organisations, has made recommendations to Ministers which we are currently considering.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/22">I can also confirm our aim to publish for consultation the new regulations for local commissioning of primary dental services and dental charging (but not the actual level of charges) in the spring of 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".89WS.2/23">This package of measures represents an unprecedented level of Government commitment and investment in NHS dentistry.</p>

	<p pid=".91WS.1/1">Following my announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-19">19 November</phrase> at column 826 of <i>Hansard</i>, of my intention to set up a review of the first national health service foundation trusts, I wrote yesterday to the chair of the Healthcare Commission (whose statutory name is the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection), Sir Ian Kennedy, asking the commission to provide me with advice in accordance with its statutory obligations.</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/2">The review will consider the challenges, difficulties and experiences of those trusts which became NHS foundation trusts on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-01">1 July 2004</phrase>, although the views and opinions of those trusts aspiring to be authorised this autumn will be important. In undertaking the review, the healthcare commission will need to work closely with the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts. However, the final report will be advice to me from the healthcare commission. I have previously made a commitment not to approve any new proposals for NHS foundation trust applications between autumn 2004 and autumn 2005, pending the outcome of this review.</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/3">The terms of reference for the review are:</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/4" class="indent">what evidence in general terms is there that NHS foundation trusts are using their powers to</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/5" class="indent">improve access to services,</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/6" class="indent">improve the quality of care for patients,</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/7" class="indent">engage the local community,</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/8" class="indent">engage staff to deliver high quality care to patients and the population;</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/9" class="indent">what obstacles have NHS foundation trusts faced and do they foresee in achieving the above objectives;</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/10" class="indent">what has been the impact of NHS foundation trusts, so far, on relationships within the local health economy;</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/11" class="indent">in what ways are their governance arrangements assisting or impeding NHS foundation trusts from exercising their powers for the benefit of patients?</p>
	<p pid=".91WS.1/12">It is my expectation that the report of the outcome of the review will be published in summer 2005. Copies of my letter to Sir Ian have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".92WS.5/1">Since the publication of the e-conveyancing consultation report last year, Land Registry has continued to work closely with stakeholders, including potential service providers, to determine the structure of e-conveyancing services in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".92WS.5/2">I have recently approved a report by Land Registry on its recommended way forward and copies of a document entitled &quot;Defining the Service&quot; have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Whilst this document describes the e-conveyancing services to be delivered, it should be noted that these are the subject of ongoing consultation with stakeholders and may be subject to future revision. The e-conveyancing service will comprise three main components:</p>
	<p pid=".92WS.5/3" class="indent">A central e-conveyancing service controlled by Land Registry.</p>
	<p pid=".92WS.5/4" class="indent">An accompanying electronic funds transfer service to be supplied by an &quot;Agent Bank&quot; (or banks) and</p>
	<p pid=".92WS.5/5" class="indent">Service delivery channels provided largely by the private sector, but including a Land Registry channel.</p>
	<p pid=".92WS.5/6">I have agreed the proposed structure and have asked Land Registry to continue work to develop these three services. In the design and build of the central e-conveyancing service and the Land Registry channel, the Department will procure the assistance of an IT strategic supplier.</p>
	<p pid=".92WS.5/7">Land Registry will procure an &quot;Agent Bank&quot; (or banks) to support the electronic funds transfer service.</p>
	<p pid=".92WS.5/8">Land Registry will consider the options for the future fee structure for its e-conveyancing and paper services and report back to me on this by the end of 2004.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-07-16.93WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1033" speakername="David Lammy" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs" colnum="93WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040716/wmstext/40716m04.htm#40716m04.html_spmin3">
	<p pid=".93WS.1/1">On the <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-14">14 July</phrase> I made the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (Commencement No 4) Order 2004. The order will bring into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-27">27 September 2004</phrase> the whole of the remainder of Part 1 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 except for section 21(4) and (5).</p>
	<p pid=".93WS.1/2">I have today also laid before each House the Commonhold Regulations 2004 and the Commonhold (Land Registration) Rules 2004 with, in each case, an explanatory memorandum, which includes a regulatory impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".93WS.1/3">The effect of these instruments is that as from <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-27">27 September</phrase> commonhold will be available in England and Wales as a new way of owning interdependent freehold properties, such as blocks of flats. It combines the security of freehold ownership with a robust standard legal framework for the management of common facilities. It will be an alternative to long leasehold ownership and will be equally available for residential and commercial property.</p>
	<p pid=".93WS.1/4">The implementation of commonhold fulfils a manifesto commitment made in 2001 and will increase housing choice.</p>
	<p pid=".93WS.1/5">To accompany the Commonhold Regulations my Department has published non-statutory guidance. I have placed copies in the Libraries of both Houses. It is intended that Land Registry Practice Guide in connection with the Commonhold (Land Registration) Rules will be published in the near future following the making of a fee order for commonhold applications. Copies of the Regulations and the non-statutory guidance will be available on my Department's website and copies of the rules will be available on Land Registry's website.</p>
