	<p pid="a.35WS.3/1">In my oral statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-26">26 October</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-10-26.308"><i>Official Report</i>, column 308</phrase>, I referred to the work my Department is carrying out jointly with ornithologists to monitor wild birds for avian influenza in the UK. The results of this surveillance will be of interest, to varying degrees, to the House and general public. My Department has therefore established mechanisms for the reporting of the surveys findings according to the level of significance as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/2">We expect that a number of samples taken over the coming months will demonstrate the presence of low pathogenic non H5 or H7 avian influenza viruses. These have little significance in the epidemiology of avian influenza disease in domestic poultry. When these low pathogenic Al virus types (which are not H5 or H7) are isolated, they will be reported via the DEFRA website as will negative results: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">www.defra.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/3">In the event that low pathogenic avian influenza viruses of type H5 or H7 are isolated, my Department will ensure that Health colleagues are informed as early as possible and prepare a briefing document which gives a clear explanation of the findings. If appropriate, a press briefing or conference will be held jointly with Health colleagues which will seek to cover as many issues as possible. Information will be posted on the DEFRA website and stakeholders will be updated.</p>
	<p pid="a.35WS.3/4">Should a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of any type be isolated Health colleagues will be informed and an announcement to both Houses will be made. My Department will ensure the thorough communication of the facts to the public and arrange early stakeholder meetings to ensure that key messages are understood. Communications will take place regularly as the disease strain is identified and investigations reveal more information.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-12-01a.41WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" speakername="Anne McGuire" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions" colnum="41WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051201/wmstext/51201m02.htm#51201m02.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/1">I am pleased to inform you today of the launch of a new unit, the Office for Disability Issues (ODI), which fulfils a key recommendation of the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report, &quot;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&quot;, published in January of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/2">The Office for Disability Issues will lead cross-government work to drive forward the report's vision of substantive equality for disabled people by 2025.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/3">Despite great advances in civil rights and services since 1997, outcomes for disabled people have remained disappointing in a range of areas including employment, income, and education. Therefore it is vital that steps are taken now to minimise the barriers presently preventing an individual's full participation in their community and the economy. All Departments committed to the 20-year agenda set out in the Life Chances report, which will be progressed through the new Office for Disability Issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/4">The ODI will provide leadership as the focal point within for key partners working to promote improved outcomes for disabled individuals throughout their lives. As a cross-government unit, it will both influence and challenge from within, foster policy and programme coherence and integration across Departments. Working with key Government Departments, the ODI will ensure prompt implementation of the Life Chances set of recommendations for achieving full substantive equality for disabled people by 2025 as well as developing a broader and more inclusive strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/5">The ODI will become an exemplar in equal opportunities, a model public sector organisation in internal practices, external relations and activities. It will ensure that the views and aspirations of disabled people are at the centre of policymaking, by reaching out to organisations and individuals at every step, and bringing external expertise into the ODI itself. We will, for example, be advertising externally for a senior ODI post in the New Year. It will change the way Government communicates with disabled people and organisations, embedding stakeholder engagement in its day-to-day work. Using these networks, and analytical resources, the ODI will become a source of information and expertise on disability and support to Government Departments, and work to influence public perception and build awareness of disability issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/6">A core team is already in place taking this work forward, and is engaging with a wide range of individuals and organisations, and sought views specifically on the ODI earlier this year. Feedback from this exercise informed our thinking on the role and remit of the Office, and is available on the ODI website, which is also being launched today.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/7">While individual departments retain responsibility for delivery and outcomes, the ODI will take forward some specific recommendations from the Life Chances report. This includes facilitating the cross-departmental Ministerial and supporting Officials steering Groups (these groups were established at the beginning of this year). I am very grateful to my Ministerial colleagues for their valuable work so far on the Ministerial steering group.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/8">The ODI will also collate and edit an annual report on progress towards the vision for substantive equality for disabled people by 2025; and will develop a set of outcome-based measures to track this progress. An independent advisory group is currently being appointed to scope out the role and remit of a National Forum for Organisations of Disabled People. The ODI will also be setting up a Task Force on Independent Living.</p>
	<p pid="a.41WS.2/9">In addition to fulfilling recommendations in the Life Chances report, the ODI will take a broader view of disability, encompassing areas not covered in the Life Chances report. This will include supporting other Government Departments in the effective implementation of the 2005 Disability Discrimination Act's public sector duty to promote equality for disabled people. As well as being a collective resource for, the ODI will also specifically support the Minister for Disabled People.</p>
