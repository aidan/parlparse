	<p pid="c.10WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-29">29 October</phrase>, I reported progress to Parliament on the progress achieved further to my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Bradley's review of people with mental health problems or learning disabilities in the criminal justice system. The Government accepted the direction of travel set out by Lord Bradley, and committed to developing a national delivery plan incorporating a full response to the report's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/2">I am pleased to report that &quot;Improving Health, Supporting Justice&quot;, the Government's national delivery plan was published and launched at a cross-departmental health and criminal justice conference in York on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-17">Tuesday 17 November</phrase>. This delivery plan will contribute to key Government initiatives around protecting the public, reducing health inequalities, reducing reoffending and health improvement and protection. In particular, it aims to:</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/3" class="indent">provide a strategic framework within which local services can deliver quality improvements, and to communicate the framework to the relevant NHS and criminal justice organisations;</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/4" class="indent">set out the actions the Government will take to support these improvements; and</p>
	<p pid="c.10WS.1/5" class="indent">develop a national approach, by building on the good work and good practice that is already underway in individual localities and maintain the significant impetus and enthusiasm created by Lord Bradley's report, to drive forward improvements in health and social care services for offenders.</p>

	<p pid="c.11WS.4/1">The informal G6 group of Interior Ministers from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland and the UK held their most recent meeting in London on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-05">5 November</phrase>. The UK currently holds the presidency of the G6 group and the meeting was chaired by the Home Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="c.11WS.4/2">The meeting was divided into three working sessions, the first two of which were attended by the core G6 Ministers. This group sat again for the final working session, with the additional guest attendance of the United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano.</p>
	<p pid="c.11WS.4/3">The first working session considered the issue of organised crime, where the Home Secretary presented the results of the UK's recent domestic review: &quot;Extending Our Reach: A Comprehensive Approach to Tackling Serious Organised Crime&quot;, published in July, and asked what more the G6 countries could do together to tackle the threats posed. The group exchanged experiences of what had been found to work in each country in tackling organised crime. There was broad agreement to the need for organised crime to be raised up the agenda. Ministers recognised the value of working together to tackle organised crime, and agreed to more sharing of best practice where relevant.</p>
	<p pid="c.11WS.4/4">During the second session the Ministers considered what benefits data sharing could bring to strengthen borders, improve identity management and facilitate the prevention and detection of serious organised crime but also the challenges faced to ensure data was secure and protected. There was less of a consensus on this issue due to the incompatibility between legal systems in each state.</p>
	<p pid="c.11WS.4/5">The afternoon session opened with a presentation by the UK of the current terrorist threat assessment. Ministers offered information on the threats posed in their respective countries. This was followed by a discussion of how to counter radicalisation through community engagement, which focused mainly on the role of Mosques in radicalisation of young people. Conversation centred on difficulties of Mosques preaching in a non EU language (for early stage interventions), and considerations of how to better regulate Imams.</p>
	<p pid="c.11WS.4/6">The Interior Minister of Spain, Alfredo Rubalcaba, also took the opportunity to offer a factual presentation on his plans for the Spanish presidency of the EU, which will start on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>. There was no discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.11WS.4/7">The next meeting of the G6 is expected to be held in Italy in the first half of next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.15WS.2/1">The legislative programme for the fifth Session was outlined on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-18">18 November</phrase>. Eight of the 10 new Bills outlined in the Queen's Speech in this final Session of the current Parliament contain provisions that apply to Scotland; once again this is a programme that will significantly benefit people living in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/2">In this Session the Government will focus on supporting the economy as we move from recession to recovery and we will take forward measures to support people living and working in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/3">This statement provides a summary of the legislation announced in the Queen's Speech and its application to Scotland. This statement includes both new Bills that will be introduced shortly, and those Bills that are carrying-over from the last Session. It does not include draft Bills. The Bills listed in section 1 are likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament in line with the Sewel convention. A brief description is provided of the provisions likely to require consent. Section 2 details Bills that are not likely to contain provisions that require the consent of the Scottish Parliament, by way of a Legislative Consent Motion (LCM).</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/4">The list also identifies the lead Government Department:</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/5" class="italic">1. <i>UK Legislation likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament at introduction</i>:</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/6">Discussions will continue between the Government and Scottish Ministers on Bills that might include provisions that trigger the Sewel convention. The Bills identified within the Queen's Speech in this section are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/7"><i>Bribery (MoJ)</i>-This Bill primarily relates to criminal law which is a devolved matter in Scotland. Following a consultation exercise in Scotland, Scottish Ministers have agreed that the best way to reform the law on bribery in Scotland is via an LCM extending full provisions of this Bill to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/8"><i>Child Poverty Bill (HMT) (introduced in the 4th Session</i><i>)</i>-This Bill enshrines in law the Government's commitment to end child poverty by 2020. Four indicators of child poverty are identified by this Bill. An LCM is required in order to extend the commitment to those matters that are within the competence of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/9"><i>Constitutional Reform and Governance (MoJ) (introduced in the 4th Session)</i>-The majority of the provisions in the Bill extend to Scotland and Bill aims to rebuild trust in our democratic and constitutional settlement by reinforcing the principles of transparency, accountability and probity across Government. An LCM is required for provisions concerning requirements placed upon the Scottish Ministers in relation to the civil service and special advisors. An LCM is also required for the amendments concerning time-limits for human rights claims under the Human Rights and Devolution Acts.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/10"><i>Crime and Security (Home Office)</i>-The majority of this Bill will not apply to Scotland, however provisions that give Scottish Ministers new powers to regulate the private security industry will require a LCM.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/11"><i>Energy Bill (DECC)</i>-This Bill will commit the Government to developing the use of clean coal and help vulnerable households with their energy Bills. It will require an LCM for the provisions that relate to funding for up to four commercial-scale carbon capture and storage demonstration projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/12"><i>Equality Bill (GEO) (introduced in 4th Session)</i><i>-</i> Equal opportunities is a reserved matter. This Bill requires an LCM as it will amend the Scottish Ministers functions by allowing them to impose specific public sector duties on the Scottish public bodies for the three new strands.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/13"><i>Financial Services Bill (HMT)</i>-The Bill will strengthen governance of the financial sector, control the system of rewards and ensure savers and lenders are fully protected. An LCM will be required for provisions relating to consumer education.</p>
	<p pid="c.15WS.2/14"><i>Flood and Water Management (DEFRA)</i>-The Bill generally applies to England and Wales only but an LCM will be required for provisions relating to cross-border reservoir safety.</p>
