<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-12-07.81WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/739" speakername="David Blunkett" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="81WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041207/wmstext/41207m01.htm#41207m01.html_spmin3">
	<p pid=".81WS.2/1">I am pleased to be able to give the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill its second reading today.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/2">Part IV of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill contains provisions to combat the activities of the extremists within our community who stir up hatred against groups targeted because of their religious beliefs, or lack of religious beliefs, as well as those targeted on racial grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/3">Evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences in 2003 highlighted the need for such protection and we have had ample further examples of that need since. We need to combat the extremists who stir up such hatred so that people can be free to practice their religion without fear. When people hate others because of their race or religious beliefs it is often manifested; this might be in the commission of subsequent crimes motivated by hate, or in abuse, discrimination or prejudice. The reactions vary from person to person, but all hatred has a detrimental effect on both individual victims and society as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/4">These measures build on the protection already afforded by the existing incitement to racial hatred offences by amending the offences in Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 to also protect people targeted because of their religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs. They will make it an offence for a person to use words or behaviour or material that they know are threatening, abusive or insulting, and which are intended or likely to stir up hatred against the target of those threats, abuse or insults.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/5">Here are two examples of situations where, taking into account all the circumstances, the prosecuting authorities would consider taking action under the new offence:</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/6" class="indent">In response to an extreme racist organisation widely distributing material setting out a range of insulting and highly inflammatory reasons for hating Islam. Such reasons have included suggesting that Muslims are a threat to British people and liable to molest women and that they should be urgently driven out of Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/7" class="indent">and</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/8" class="indent">In response to extremists within a faith community making repeated threatening statements stirring up followers to look for ways to make trouble for unbelievers saying that God would never ever allow unbelievers to be pleased with them and created them to be enemies.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/9">These measures will be applied with equity, protecting people of varied religious beliefs and of none. They will provide a powerful response and a strong deterrent to extreme political and racist individuals and organisations who target people because of their religious beliefs and also to religious extremists who stir up hatred of others because they do not share their religious beliefs.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/10">The Government are committed to the preservation of the right to legitimate freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This includes the right to engage in free and vigorous debate about religion, including the right to criticise religious beliefs and practices. The Government also recognise that proselytism is an integral activity for many faith communities. Such debate, criticism and proselytism can be undertaken without using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour that is intended or likely to stir up hatred. Expressions of antipathy or dislike of particular religions or their adherents can also be made without crossing the thresholds of the offence. This provision will not restrict but protect people's legitimate freedom to practice their religion without fear.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/11">The provisions do not make any blanket exceptions, for example, for any activity which may be presented as a religious activity or for the recitation of any passage from sacred texts. This is because, although the vast majority of such activities would not meet any part of the thresholds for this offence, in extreme circumstances it is, for example, possible to quote or misquote passages of sacred texts out of context so that they become threatening, abusive or insulting and intended or likely to stir up hatred. Such activities would rightly be caught by the scope of the offence. Nor do the provisions define all the terms of the offence. This is deliberate and will provide the enforcement agencies with the flexibility to ensure that these offences make a full contribution in combating hate-mongering in all its various forms and contexts.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/12">The proposals retain the high thresholds and necessary safeguards contained in the existing incitement to racial hatred provision. The primary safeguards are contained in the offence itself. It has a two-part structure which examines not only the content of the words, behaviour, written material, recordings or programmes, which must be threatening, abusive or insulting, but also examines the effect of the material which must be intended or likely to stir up racial or religious hatred.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/13">&quot;Religious hatred&quot; is defined as &quot;hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief&quot;. Accordingly, the offence will only capture those activities which stir up hatred of a group of people defined by their beliefs or lack of religious beliefs. It is not a new blasphemy law and will protect people rather than ideologies.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/14">Hatred is a strong term, relating to an extreme emotion. The offences will not criminalise material that just stirs up ridicule, prejudice, dislike, contempt or anger or which simply causes offence. A further safeguard in the legislation is that a person who does not intend to stir up hatred is not guilty of an offence if they did not know that their words, behaviour, written material, recording or programmes were threatening, abusive or insulting. Furthermore the offences do not apply to anything that takes place in one's own home. All prosecutions require the consent of the Attorney-General, which will prevent the offences being misused through private prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/15">Of themselves, the following would not be caught by the offence:</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/16" class="indent">criticising the beliefs, teachings or practices of a religion or its followers; for example by claiming that they are false or harmful;</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/17" class="indent">proselytising one's own religion or urging followers of a different religion to cease practising theirs; for example Christians claiming that Jesus Christ is the way the truth, the life and the only way to God, Muslims exhorting people to submit to the will of Allah, or Atheists claiming that there is no God;</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/18" class="indent">telling jokes about religions;</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/19" class="indent">expressing antipathy or dislike of particular religions or their adherents.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/20">Of themselves these activities do not meet the criteria of the offences. However if a person were to use threatening, abusive or insulting words, actions or material with the intent or likely effect that hatred would be stirred up whilst undertaking the actions listed above, then by definition, they could rightly fall into the scope of the offence.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/21">These measures accord with, and will operate in the light of, the guarantees afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998. Under the Human Rights Act any Court in interpreting legislation, including these offences, must do so in way in which is compatible with the rights under the European Convention. With these offences the rights in play are going to be Article 9, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and Article 10, the right to freedom of expression. In interpreting these offences the Court will have to consider both of these rights and, if necessary, balance one against the other. Article 9 states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and that this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance. It also states that freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject to limitations prescribed by law and necessary in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order and the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/22">Article 10 of the European Convention states that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and that this includes the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas. Similarly it also states that the exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to restrictions prescribed by law that are necessary in the interests of public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime and the protection of the reputation or rights of others.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/23">These offences are justifiable, necessary and proportionate measures for the prevention of disorder or crime and the protection of the rights of others; the need for which is reflected in these articles. Indeed because these provisions protect groups from hatred directed against them because of religious belief, they safeguard the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion enshrined in Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/24">The Crown Prosecution Service will produce guidance on how these offences will be enforced but it is important that this guidance does not pre-empt the consideration of these proposals by Parliament. There will be consultation on that guidance as it is developed and it will be subject to regular review.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/25">With the support of my colleague, the Attorney-General, I make this statement as a matter of public record, which can be drawn upon in any future decisions taken by all the enforcement agencies, to clarify to all that this new measure will provide protection for those who need it without restricting legitimate freedom of speech and religion.</p>

	<p pid=".84WS.2/1">I am making this statement as required by section 31(6) of the Energy Act 2004 (&quot;the Act&quot;) to coincide with the issuing of the ministerial directions giving the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) its designated responsibilities under the Act. The statement reflects the transitional funding arrangements for the NDA that will be put in place to allow it to get on with its work during the EC Commission investigation into notified state aid to the NDA.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/2">In determining the amounts to be credited to the Nuclear Decommissioning Funding Account (&quot;NDFA&quot;) under section 31(4)(c) of the Act, the following policy applies:</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/3" class="italic">Basis upon which determinations for the purposes of section 31(4)(c) are to be made</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/4">1. Pending the outcome of the European Commission's investigation announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December 2004</phrase> into the UK Government's establishment of the NDA, the basis on which any determinations for the purposes of section 31(4)(c) are to be made will be to credit to the NDFA such amounts as are sufficient to provide a sound basis for funding the NDA's activities consistent with:</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/5" class="indent">(a) the requirement that no new state resources shall be made available to the NDA for operating, cleaning up or decommissioning in respect of any of the economic activities of the NDA which are the subject of the Commission's investigation; and</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/6" class="indent">(b) the requirement that no advantage shall be conferred on BNFL or its successor companies pending the outcome of the Commission's investigation, and in particular that the net asset position of BNFL and the group of companies of which it forms part must not be improved.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/7">2. The amount of any determination for the purposes of section 31(4)(c) in relation to any financial year shall be the sum of the following elements:</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/8" class="indent">(a) an amount equal to the value of any assets taken out of BNFL's existing resources comprising the nuclear liabilities investment portfolio (&quot;NLIP&quot;) by way of any nuclear transfer scheme which takes effect under section 42 of the Act during that financial year;</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/9" class="indent">(b) in respect of the NDA's responsibilities in relation to sites operated by UKAEA as at the date of this statement, and nuclear liabilities for which responsibility is, as at the date of this statement, accepted by UKAEA, such amount as is appropriate within the Department of Trade and Industry's relevant expenditure limit.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/10" class="indent">(c) in respect of the NDA's responsibilities in relation to nuclear liabilities for which responsibility was formerly accepted by the Ministry of Defence but is, as at the date of this statement, accepted by the Department of Trade and Industry, such amount as is appropriate within the Department of Trade and Industry's relevant expenditure limit.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/11">3. To the extent that the assets referred to in paragraph 2(a) above do not comprise cash, their value is to be determined as at the date upon which the transfer scheme whereby they are transferred takes effect.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/12" class="italic">The minimum credit balance of the NDFA</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/13">4. For the purposes of section 31(7)(b) of the Act, the minimum credit balance of the NDFA shall be &pound;1.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/14">5. The basis on which this determination has been made is that the sums to be comprised in the determination in any financial year in accordance with paragraph 2 above (combined with any other amounts credited under section 31(4)(a), (c) or (d)) are expected to be sufficient to fund the NDA's activities during the financial year in question, but no more. It is intended that grants made under section 22(1) of the Act will be subject to conditions under section 22(2) which will restrict the use of sums drawn against the credits referred to in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above to the matters respectively referred to in those paragraphs. To the extent that I conclude that further funding can and should be made available to the NDA in any given year (pending the outcome of the Commission's investigation) other than in respect of the matters referred to in paragraphs 2(b) and (c), further amounts will (if appropriate) be transferred from the NLIP and any determination which has been made under section 31(4)(c) of the Act will be revised such that corresponding credits will be made to the NDFA. Amounts equal to these credits will then be remitted to the NDA by way of grant under section 22(1) of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/15">6. The figure of &pound;1 will allow the maximum amount to be remitted to the NDA by way of grant under section 22(1) of the Act while still leaving a credit balance in the account.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/16" class="italic">Interpretation</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/17">7. In this statement, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions defined in the Act have the meanings given to them by the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/18">8. In addition, the following expressions have the following meanings:</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/19" class="indent"><i>economic activities</i> means the provision of services hitherto undertaken by companies in the BNFL group that might in principle have been provided by a private sector entity, given the existence of a commercial market place and the potential for profit making. NDA's responsibilities in relation to &quot;economic activities&quot; will include responsibilities in respect of economic nuclear liabilities;</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/20" class="indent"><i>economic nuclear liabilities</i> means those nuclear liabilities which exist or may come into existence in respect of sites operated as at the date of thisstatement by companies in the BNFL group, excluding those nuclear liabilities referred to in paragraphs 2(b) and (c) above.</p>
