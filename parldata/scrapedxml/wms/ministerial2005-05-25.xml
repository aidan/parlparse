	<p pid=".16WS.6/1">Carlisle and large areas of Cumbria experienced exceptional storm and flood damage between 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-12">12 January 2005</phrase>. Given these circumstances I am satisfied that financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme is justified. A scheme will therefore be established under section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Grants will be paid to the authorities to cover 85 per cent. of the eligible costs above a threshold, which they have incurred in dealing with the storm and flood damage.</p>

	<p pid=".18WS.5/1">The Employment and Social Policy, Health and Consumer's Affairs Council will be held on 2 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-03">3 June</phrase> in Luxembourg. Employment and social policy issues will be taken on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-02">2 June</phrase>. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Alan Johnson) and my hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Sutcliffe), will represent the UK. Health issues will be taken on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-03">3 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/3">Integrated guidelines for growth and employment (2005&ndash;08). Proposal for a Council decision on guidelines on member states' employment policies.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/4" class="indent">The annual employment guidelines are a key element of the European employment strategy. The guidelines set out the framework of common priorities for member states' employment policies and are agreed by the Council of Ministers before coming into force. The annual economic and employment guidelines have been integrated for 2005. The 2005 employment guidelines reflect the conclusions of the Luxembourg Spring Council (22 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase>) by being more focused on growth and jobs. This is tabled for a general approach (a high level agreement on broad principles). The UK supports the Commission's approach in producing shorter guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/5">Proposed directive implementing a social partners agreement on working time for cross border rail crew.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/6" class="indent">This is tabled for political agreement to agree the measure before reaching formal adoption of common position. The UK welcomes social partner dialogue and supports, in principle, a dfirective on a social partner agreement on this subject. The proposed directive is intended to implement a social partners' agreement concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-27">27 January 2004</phrase> between the European Transport Workers' Federation and the Community of European Railways&mdash;respectively the social partners representing unions and employers in the rail sector&mdash;on certain aspects of the working conditions of mobile workers assigned to interoperable cross-border rail services. However, the UK has concerns about the potential negative impact of this particular agreement on the prospects for growth in the European rail sector and feels that the European institutions need to take seriously their undertakings on better regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/7">Proposal for a Council regulation amending regulation (EC) No 2062/94 establishing a European agency for safety and health at work (Bilbao).</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/8">Proposal for a Council regulation amending regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 on the creation of a European foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Dublin).</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/9" class="indent">The Bilbao agency collates and distributes information on health and safety whilst the Dublin foundation undertakes monitoring as well as research and development projects. These two items are both tabled for political agreement. The proposed regulations seek to improve governance and structures following enlargement. The UK supports both regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/10">Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/11" class="indent">EU negotiations on the revision of the working time directive have been ongoing since September 2004. There will be a public debate on this item. The UK is seeking EU agreement to legislative proposals to retain individual workers' freedom to choose to work more than 48 hours a week and provide a solution to the issues of on-call working.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/12">Green Paper on an EU approach to managing economic migration.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/13" class="indent">The Commission Green Paper was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-07">7 January 2005</phrase>, launched a consultation on the potential added value of a community framework on admission of economic migrants, and on the form that such a framework might take. This is tabled for an exchange of views. The Government have submitted their response to this Green Paper and have provided the response to both scrutiny committees.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/14">Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European institute for gender equality.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/15" class="indent">The creation of an institute for gender equality was supported by the Council of Ministers in June 2004. The institute will provide the relevant institutions and authorities of the Community and its member states with objective, reliable and comparative information on gender equality and data at national and European levels and to give visibility to gender equality. This is tabled for general approach. The UK supports the principle of a European institute for gender equality, as it would raise the profile of gender equality across Europe and provide a more coherent approach to gathering research and information at EU level. However, it should be budget neutral, add value and avoid duplication.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/16">Review of the implementation by the member states and the EU institutions of the Beijing platform for action.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/17" class="indent">The Beijing platform for action is the UN's agenda for women's empowerment launched in Beijing in 1995. It aims at accelerating the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and at removing all the obstacles to women's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic, social, cultural and political decision-making.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.5/18">The objective of this agenda item is to agree the review of the Beijing platform for action proposed by the Presidency in the Council conclusions paper. These Council conclusions recognise that gender equality is a fundamental principle of the EU and is one of the objectives and tasks of the Community and that mainstreaming equality between women and men in all its activities represents a specific mission for the Community. The conclusions are based on the common declaration adopted by EU gender equality Ministers in Luxembourg in February 2004 on future European strategies. The UK fully supports the Council conclusions.</p>
