	<p pid="a.43WS.2/1">I am announcing today the terms of reference for a review of higher education student finance delivery, which will be conducted by my Department:</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.2/2" class="indent">To review the arrangements for the delivery of Government financial support to higher education students, and its collection from borrowers, in England and recommend options for improvement. The review should be completed by November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.2/3" class="indent">In making recommendations, the review shall have regard to the Government's principles for improving public service delivery, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.2/4" class="indent">a focus on the needs of customers, including the provision of advice and the particular needs of under-represented student groups;</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.2/5" class="indent">an efficient and effective delivery process with appropriate use of technology to improve customer service;</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.2/6" class="indent">clear objectives and challenging performance measures, benchmarked against comparable services;</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.2/7" class="indent">the need for a strategic relationship between the Department and any delivery organisations, with clearly allocated responsibility and accountability and effective management of delivery risks; and</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.2/8" class="indent">that the service demonstrates value-for-money and is sufficiently flexible to deal with possible future changes in the higher education environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.2/9">The review will also consider the future role of the Student Loans Company in improved delivery arrangements and its status and mission.</p>

	<p pid="a.43WS.5/1">Following extensive discussion and consultation with healthcare professionals, patients and their representatives, and the oxygen service industry, I am announcing today that four companies have won contracts, following competitive tender, to provide the home oxygen service in 10 national health service home oxygen service regions in England. The four companies are Air Products, the British Oxygen Company, Allied Oxycare/Medigas and Linde. This is a five-year contract, with an option to renew for a further two years. The overall annual cost of the new service is some &pound;49 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.5/2">NHS patients will have access to an improved service, including for the first time portable or ambulatory oxygen systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.43WS.5/3">There are other improvements offering better choice and access to better services through a range of technically advanced oxygen equipment that will meet the needs of individual patients, with expert advice and support on its use on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis. The new service will start later this year.</p>
