<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-03-16.17WS.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local and Regional Government" colnum="17WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050316/wmstext/50316m01.htm#50316m01.html_spmin2">
	<p>Today I am inviting all English fire and rescue authorities to bid for a share of &pound;150 million of credits available through the private finance initiative (PFI). This considerable new investment is available to help fire and rescue authorities to deliver some of the key assets that they need to keep building a better more effective and efficient service that saves more lives.</p>
	<p>Over the past five years fire and rescue authorities have used &pound;200 million PFI credits successfully to provide innovative new fire stations, training centres, headquarters, a vehicle fleet and other equipment. I am confident that fire and rescue authorities will have plenty of ideas for what they could deliver with a share of the &pound;150 million credits now available. I look forward to receiving their proposals.</p>
	<p>This investment re-confirms the Government's commitment to meeting their public sector agreement (PSA) target by 2010 to reduce the number of accidental fire-related deaths in the home by 20 per cent. and the number of deliberate fires by 10 per cent.</p>
	<p>It comes on top of the Government's already significant investment in new assets for the English fire and rescue service. We are investing heavily in a new radio system and regional control centres and up to &pound;188 million in mass decontamination and urban search and rescue equipment and training. Plus we have announced a &pound;25 million fire prevention package to provide free smoke alarms and fire safety advice to one and a quarter million vulnerable households, mainly in deprived areas, in England over the period 2004&ndash;08. Every English fire and fire and rescue authority will again receive an above inflation increase in grant in 2005&ndash;06 and will receive a share of &pound;57.98 million in supported capital expenditure.</p>
	<p>Fire and rescue authorities have been asked to submit initial expressions of interest by 31 May 2005 and have until 7 October 2005 to submit indicative bids for the &pound;150 million of credits to ODPM.</p>
	<p>Copies of the fire service circular announcing the bidding round are available in the Libraries of both Houses and are on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at: <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a>.</p>
