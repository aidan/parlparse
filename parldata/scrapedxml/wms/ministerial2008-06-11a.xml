<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-06-11a.18WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for International Development" colnum="18WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/wmstext/80611m0001.htm#080611104000095">
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/1">The written parliamentary statement issued on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-03">3 June</phrase> on Burma Cyclone Nargis stated that &quot;A total of 20 DFID-funded aid flights have now arrived in Rangoon... All these items have been consigned to the UN, NGOs and the Red Cross.&quot; This statement was reflected in replies I gave to Mr. Andrew Mitchell MP and Mr. Kevan Jones MP on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-06">6 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/2">I learned on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-10">10 June</phrase> that at the request of Save the Children Fund (SCF) the paperwork for the clearance of its relief goods was handled by a clearing agent. No payment was received by this clearing agent for its service to SCF, and the full extent of the involvement of the clearing agent was to clear the documents for the shipment with the Burmese customs. While the airway bills for these supplies list the clearing agent as the consignee for the goods, the relief goods themselves were transferred directly from the aircraft to SCF's warehouse for onward distribution by SCF or other NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/3">The agent the SCF used to clear their goods is a Government business consortium under the name of the National Disaster Preparedness Central Committee (Ngapudaw-Haing Gyi) which includes a company called Shwe Thanlwin Limited. This company and its chairman, U Kyaw Win, are listed in the Annex to the EU common position as &quot;persons who benefit from government economic policies&quot; and are subject to sanctions.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/4">I have written today to the chief executive of SCF expressing grave concern at SCF's choice of clearing agent and informing them that we will not provide any further relief supplies to them through this clearing agent.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/5">DFID staff have also re-checked the arrangements for other UK supplies delivered to the World Food Programme, Merlin, Medecins Sans Frontieres and the International Federation of the Red Cross. These organisations are named as the consignee on the Airway Bills and have received all the goods intended for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.18WS.2/6">We continue to monitor the delivery of UK assistance to our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners for the victims of the cyclone.</p>

	<p pid="a.19WS.2/1">I will attend the second Transport Council of the Slovenian presidency which takes place in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="">13 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.2/2">In road transport, there were progress reports to the April Council on three current legislative proposals: the recast regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market; the regulation on common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; and the recast regulation on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services. The Council will aim to reach a political agreement on these proposals. These include new provisions for setting up national registers so that information about road haulage and coach companies operating within the EU can be exchanged between member states' authorities for enforcement purposes. The proposals also seek to clarify and simplify the rules for hauliers and coaches working outside of their home territory, including the rules on cabotage. The Government still have a reservations on some of these proposals and will be putting our case to the other members of the Transport Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.2/3">The Council will aim to reach a general approach on a recast directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers. The proposal is essentially a consolidation&mdash;as well as providing for a very minor update&mdash;of existing directives covering the periodic technical inspection of vehicles to verify that they are roadworthy. UK domestic legislation already makes equivalent provision to the two changes in the text.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.2/4">The Council will be asked to adopt conclusions following the Commission communication on multi-annual contracts for rail infrastructure quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.2/5">The aim of the communication is to promote the adoption through the Community of multi-annual funding agreements for rail infrastructure in order to provide a more stable and efficient financial environment for the delivery of improvements in rail infrastructure quality. We support the adoption of the Council conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.2/6">There will be a progress report and the Council will aim to reach a general approach on a directive on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. The UK Government supports the policy objectives behind the proposal, as well as the principle of using public procurement to help stimulate the market for cleaner and energy-efficient vehicles. We consider that the revised text submitted to Council is a significant improvement on the Commission's original and goes in the right direction of encouraging cost-effective green procurement without imposing an unacceptable burden on public authorities. However, we regret the lack of a formal impact assessment, and will want, with the Commission, to keep the costs and benefits of the proposed measures under review, as discussions progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.2/7">The Council will be asked to adopt a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations towards an EU/Western Balkans transport treaty. The UK welcomes this opportunity to work towards improvement of the infrastructure of the Western Balkans and better transport links.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.2/8">In aviation, the Council will be asked to adopt decisions authorising the Commission to open negotiations on comprehensive air transport agreements with Australia and New Zealand. The UK can support the opening of negotiations with these countries and is content with the proposed negotiating mandate.</p>
