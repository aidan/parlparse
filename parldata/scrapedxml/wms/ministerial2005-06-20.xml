Copies are available in the House Library and on the Home Office website. The first two of these describe how the Home Office builds a safe, just and tolerant society as reflected in our strategic objectives and key targets. These set out how, in turn, delivery depends on the Department's three key pillars of responsibility, dealing with, policing security, community safety and active communities; ensuring that our new National Offender Management Service is implemented and that we work effectively with our partners across the criminal justice system (CJS); and establishing a clearly robust and fair approach to immigration, citizenship and nationality.</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.2/2">The report is primarily focused on 2004&ndash;05, setting out our performance against key targets and describing how our activities contributed towards them. The plan is focused on the present financial year, explaining how we will deliver better public services and how the Department is organising itself to deliver these.</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.2/3">We are also placing on our website <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a> the Department's investment strategy. This sets out at greater length the critical role that capital investment plays in improving our key public services.</p>

	<p pid=".28WS.7/1">I am pleased to announce that the benefits of standards to UK business, innovation and the wider economy can be quantified for the first time. A programme of studies commissioned by the National Standardisation Strategic Framework (NSSF), have brought together the analysis of findings fro the University of Surrey, Nottingham University Business School and the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research in Germany. The principal findings of the report show that:</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/2" class="indent">Formal standards contribute &pound;2.5 billion to the growth of the UK economy annually as a means of spreading knowledge and technology;</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/3" class="indent">Through this role, since 1948 the benefit of formal standards to UK GDP exceeds &pound;75 billion;</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/4" class="indent">Standards enable 13 per cent. of the growth in labour productivity; and</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/5" class="indent">Standards are emphasised as an enabler of innovation.</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/6">The report can be found on:</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/7"><a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/iese/The-Empirical-Economics-of-Standards.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/iese/ The&ndash;Empirical&ndash;Economics&ndash;of&ndash;Standards.pdf</a> and hard copies will be made available in the parliamentary Library.</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/8">The National Standardisation Strategic Framework (NSSF) was developed by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) to provide a platform for increasing the awareness use and understanding of standards and standardisation in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/9">This research quantifies the impact of standards on the success of UK business of all types.</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/10">As the national standards body for the UK, the British Standards Institution plays an important role in enabling innovation and technology transfer within national and international markets. This creation of synergies is found to accelerate the speed to market of products and services which allows businesses to keep ahead of the game in an ever-changing marketplace.</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/11">For many years business opinion has tended to divide regarding the genuine impact of standards. While many firms have embraced standards as a valuable tool for strategic management, others argue that their presence has acted as a halt on business freedom and competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".28WS.7/12">For that reason I commend to Parliament this research and urge UK industry to make business standards a boardroom issue in order to provide tangible assurances of progress across all aspects of commerce.</p>
