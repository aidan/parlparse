<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-17a.9WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families" colnum="9WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070717/wmstext/70717m0001.htm#07071769000268">
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/1">The recent flooding has brought widespread damage to large areas of central and northern England.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/2">The Government are very grateful to the committed staff in schools, early years and childcare settings and local authorities who have worked so hard to contain and reduce the effect of the floodwaters, to get many schools and early years settings back in use, and to provide places in temporary or alternative accommodation where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/3">In the flood hit regions, numbers of schools which lost teaching days included 91 in Kingston-upon-Hull, 72 in East Riding, 72 in Doncaster, 66 in Sheffield, 27 in Lincolnshire, six in Nottinghamshire, four in Derbyshire and two in Rotherham. Only eight of Kingston-upon-Hull's 99 school sites were unaffected:&mdash;65 primary schools, 13 secondary schools, 10 special units and three nurseries were all temporarily closed. Nine sites were still closed last week. The local authority has found temporary premises for the children affected. Kingston-upon-Hull calculates that the flooding resulted in losing 107,000 pupil-days, but prompt action by the schools and council avoided losing-up to 90,000 more. In Doncaster, six schools were damaged and closed at some point&mdash;but only one is still closed. In the East Midlands, five schools have all their pupils in temporary premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/4">Our main aim is to help as many of these schools and early years settings as possible to re-open at permanent premises by the start of the September-term; and, where that is not possible, to help ensure satisfactory alternative arrangements so that no child suffers educationally because of flood damage. There is still an immense amount of hard work to do. The immediate dangers are over, but every child and young person and their parents will rightly expect no let up in efforts to get back to normal as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/5">To that end, my Department is working closely with the regional government offices and local authorities, to:</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/6" class="indent">assess fully the extent of the damage to schools and early years and childcare provision (including children's centres)&mdash;both buildings and equipment;</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/7" class="indent">assess the impact the floods have had on children and young people's ability to learn and make the progress we expect (this includes any impact on examinations or course-work);</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/8" class="indent">take decisions on how best to get children back into proper permanent educational accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/9">Already the Government have allocated &pound;14 million and have widened the rules on Bellwin funds to deal with flood damage. In addition my Department will make available an initial sum of &pound;10 million for flood affected schools and children's services. My officials, with colleagues from Government offices, will hold detailed discussions on an area-by-area/case-by-case basis to determine how best to provide both interim and long-term solutions. As part of these discussions, we will:</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/10" class="indent">determine how best we can use and, if necessary, re-phase the significant capital investment planned over the next five years to address the needs of the schools most affected;</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/11" class="indent">decide what additional educational support we can give schools and other providers to help maintain standards while there is disruption;</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/12">and look to fund, in particular:</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/13" class="indent">extra surveyors&mdash;to be arranged through existing Departmental call-off contracts&mdash;to help authorities accurately assess damage; and more quickly reach a clear picture on the cost of repairs;</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/14" class="indent">temporary accommodation for those settings which will still be in such accommodation in September;</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/15" class="indent">additional summer activities for young people who cannot yet return to their homes, and are living in caravans or other temporary housing;</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/16" class="indent">family support workers to help with longer-term pressures on family life for families who have been seriously affected by the floodwaters.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/17">In addition, I have already written to:</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/18" class="indent">exam boards, asking them to ensure that, where exams were disrupted, cases seeking special consideration are dealt with promptly and with due consideration; and</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/19" class="indent">Ofsted, asking for inspections to take proper account of the disruption and loss of school days and records caused by the floods.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/20">The Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight) is working closely with the Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley Hughes) to oversee implementation of the above programme of DCSF work on flood recovery. These Ministers are seeing daily progress reports from Departmental officials. DCSF is playing its part in the flood-recovery inter-ministerial group chaired by the Minister for Local Government (John Healey).</p>

	<p pid="a.12WS.1/1">The Air Quality Strategy will be laid before Parliament and published today.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/2">Government are committed to delivering cleaner air to protect people's health and the environment. Protecting and improving air quality is a key objective for DEFRA and the devolved Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/3">Our national Air Quality Strategy, last published in 2000 with an Addendum in 2003, contained policies for improving air quality and set standards and objectives for the main pollutants of concern to be met between 2003 and 2010 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/4">The quality of our air in the United Kingdom has improved considerably over the last few decades, and much has been achieved through implementation of tighter controls over emissions of harmful pollutants from industry, transport and domestic sectors. These measures have helped to reduce by many thousands the numbers of people dying prematurely and being admitted to hospital as a result of air pollution. We are now meeting the strategy's objectives for four of the pollutants throughout the UK and meeting all the strategy's objectives in most parts of the country, although not at some hotspot problem areas, such as along some busy roads and in some cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/5">But air pollution still has a significant impact and is estimated to reduce the life expectancy of every person in the UK by an average of seven to eight months, with estimated annual health costs of up to &pound;20 billion. It can also seriously damage our ecosystems.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/6">Over the last year or so an extensive review of the strategy was undertaken to examine what more might be done. This review has involved one of the most comprehensive environmental analyses ever carried out by the Government. stakeholders were closely involved at each stage of the review, both in forming and responding to the official consultation process last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/7">The new Air Quality Strategy, which I am publishing today in partnership with the devolved administrations, draws conclusions from the consultation. It sets out a way forward for work and planning on air quality issues, sets out details of the objectives to be achieved and introduces a new policy framework for tackling fine particles, similar to the approach being proposed in the new European air quality directive, which is currently under negotiation. The strategy also identifies new measures which modelling shows could help achieve significant health benefits and help us move closer towards meeting our targets. These measures have been subject to a thorough analysis of the estimated reductions in air pollution, and quantification and valuation of costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/8">The strategy's policies have been considered for their impact on climate change, and there are many co-benefits that can be achieved. Over the longer-term, policies to address both climate change and air pollution emissions together can potentially deliver further significant improvements air quality and public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/9">The strategy recognises the important role for industry, transport and local authorities in helping to deliver air quality improvements. It also follows the better regulation agenda for adopting the most effective ways of delivering outcomes without placing unnecessary costs on those who are regulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.1/10">We will now start the process for detailed consideration of the potential new measures to develop them further and co-ordinate and align with other policy measures yet to be implemented. Each new measure will be subject to the full policy scrutiny process and formal impact assessment. I will continue to keep the House informed about these and other air quality developments.</p>

	<p pid="a.13WS.2/1">I am today announcing that 30 police forces across England and Wales will be taking part in a new programme aimed at establishing new collaborative arrangements for combating serious organised crime and other threats to public safety (also known as protective services).</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/2">The Home Office will support 10 separate initiatives by police forces and authorities to become demonstrator sites for joint working solutions to deliver greater capability and capacity in a range of protective services.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/3">The initiatives that will be supported are:</p>

			<tr pid="a.13WS.2/12"> <td>Dyfed-Powys / Gwent / North Wales / South Wales</td> <td><i>Major Crime and Serious Organised and Cross </i><i>Border Crime</i> exploring collaborative approaches to delivering these services across the forces in Wales.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.13WS.2/13"> <td>Essex / Kent</td> <td><i>Project Forefront</i> developing and implementing a co-ordinated and integrated strategic command capability, improving operational delivery of policing services to the Thames estuary, sea ports, air ports and the strategic roads network</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.13WS.2/14"> <td>Hertfordshire / Bedfordshire</td> <td><i>Major Crime Collaboration </i>establishing a co-located major crime capability.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.13WS.2/15"> <td>Humberside / North Yorkshire / South Yorkshire / West Yorkshire</td> <td><i>Regional Undercover Unit / Human Resources </i><i>Policies</i> creating a unit to provide a policy lead, training and support infrastructure to undercover officers and exploring the potential for integrating employment frameworks, terms and conditions and human resources policies.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.13WS.2/16"> <td>Surrey / Sussex</td> <td><i>Joining Forces Programme</i> drawing together protective services into an integrated specialist operations command covering both force areas.</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/19">These initiatives have been selected from 22 bids to provide a balanced programme across England and Wales to explore and develop the models of collaboration between forces that can deliver these vital services to protect the public more effectively and more efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/20">Collaborative working is a key part of a national programme of work the Government are taking forward, in consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities to improve the way the police combat serious organised crime and other threats to public safety. All police forces will be expected to meet newly developed protective service standards. Forces will need to collaborate to do this and the demonstration sites initiative will help ensure that all forces can learn from the experiences of these sites and make use of their best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/21">The selected demonstrator sites will together be offered &pound;3.7 million in Home Office funding to contribute to their start-up costs and they will take part in an evaluation process to be managed by the National Policing Improvement Agency which will monitor and measure their progress and delivery of benefits and develop a shared body of knowledge for the police service.</p>

	<p pid="a.15WS.1/1">I would like to inform the House that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has signed a certificate to exempt Transport for London (TfL) and the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) from certain provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 to facilitate the bulk transfer of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) data from TfL to the MPS. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police believes that it is necessary due to the enduring, vehicle-borne terrorist threat to London. The MPS requires bulk ANPR data from TfL's camera network in London specifically for terrorism intelligence purposes and to prevent and investigate such offences. The infrastructure will allow the realtime flow of data between TfL and the MPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.1/2">As one of the conditions of this certificate, the MPS will provide an annual report to the Information Commissioner so that he can satisfy himself that the personal data processed under the certificate is required for the purposes of safeguarding national security, and that any processing that is undertaken other than under an exemption set out in the certificate is carried out in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.1/3">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will review the operation of the certificate in three months time when the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police provides her with a separate, interim report so that she can be personally satisfied that the certificate is being operated in accordance with the agreement and that the privacy of individuals is protected. In the coming months, proposals will be developed and discussed across Government to ensure that bulk ANPR data-sharing with the police is subject to a robust regulatory regime which ensures reasonable transparency and scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="a.19WS.4/1">The Employment and Social Policy informal meeting was held on 5 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-07">7 July</phrase> in Guimar&atilde;es, Portugal. I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.4/2">The theme of the informal was &quot;Improving Policies, Improving Results&quot;, which was discussed in two plenary sessions. The discussions were informed by a paper presented by Maria Jo&atilde;o Rodrigues, who was involved in the formulation of the Lisbon strategy during the last Portuguese presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.4/3">Ministers discussed what the future priorities of the Lisbon strategy should be and how to make the Open Method of Co-ordination (OMC) work better. There was broad agreement that the Lisbon goals were the right ones, and that next year's review should avoid major changes to the strategy, as continuity was needed and would enable comparisons over time. Ministers believed that the focus should be on proper implementation and better exchange of good practice. A number of member states did call for greater prominence to be given to the social dimension of Lisbon. On behalf of the UK, I made it clear that we should not re-open the employment guidelines and that the focus should remain on jobs and growth. I also emphasised that we needed to do more to tackle skills issues as this is the key to helping people into work and ensuring their progression.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.4/4">In terms of process, most felt the OMC was a success. There was broad agreement that there should be no new instruments or processes. Suggestions for areas of greater focus were: education, skills and lifelong learning; making flexicurity work; increasing labour market participation (including active ageing, work-life balance, gender equality, childcare provision); fighting child poverty; making mobility in the EU work; and tackling the social impacts of migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.4/5">Germany also suggested a one off &quot;European Social Day&quot; where, for example, Parliaments across the EU could discuss the EU's contribution to social policies on the same day. The idea received considerable support.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.4/6">The presidency concluded that the revised Lisbon process had improved the focus on employment but The meeting had highlighted the need to: have greater co-ordination of policy approaches; improve the integration and visibility of social priorities; and a balanced approach to flexicurity.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-17a.20WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" speakeroffice="The Minister for Pensions Reform" colnum="20WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070717/wmstext/70717m0003.htm#07071769000279">
	<p pid="a.20WS.1/1">The review of Pension Scheme Assets led by Andrew Young published its interim findings yesterday on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-16">16 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.20WS.1/2">The review team has worked hard to gather data and engage with stakeholders and I am grateful for their efforts and the co-operation of those who have contributed. The interim findings represent a significant improvement on our understanding of the circumstances of failed pension schemes and provide us with an evidence base upon which to build policy in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.20WS.1/3">The Assets Review has made considerable progress in identifying the value of assets remaining in pension schemes that qualify for FAS and has stated that the current process of annuitisation on a scheme by scheme basis may not offer the best use of these assets. It concludes that it is probable that additional value for money could be secured through a number of different methods and the team will focus on investigating the feasibility of these options before it delivers its final conclusions later in the year. I welcome these interim findings and am hopeful that the work that the review team is to continue over the summer will enable us to increase the value of assistance that FAS is able to offer without further calls on public funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.20WS.1/4">The potential for any increase will, of course, depend on the value of assets available. While it is too early to say with any certainty that the review will lead to a means of improving FAS above the promised 80 per cent. level (subject to the cap), it is hopeful that this is the case. In the meantime the Government's position has always been (and remains) that trustees must act in the best interests of their members but, trustees may wish to take into account the effect that the decisions they take about winding up their scheme may have on the amount of assets potentially available to increase assistance levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.20WS.1/5">It is important that trustees continue with the processes of wind-up, including data cleansing and determination of asset share. They should also continue to pay interim pensions to members as they reach normal retirement age and co-operate with the Financial Assistance Scheme Operational Unit to ensure initial payments can be made from age 65.</p>
