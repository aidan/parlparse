	<p pid=".33WS.2/1">The Government promised to report back to both Houses 12 months from my predecessor's statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-28">28 January 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-01-28.11"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 11&ndash;12WS</phrase> on the alleged import of domestic cat and dog fur into the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/2">The Government understand the ethical abhorrence felt about this issue. Our priority remains to establish the facts about the extent of this alleged trade and to act in a measured way. To this end, we encouraged interested parties to come forward with hard evidence of such fur being on sale in the UK and we undertook work to establish a reliable scientific test to identify between different species of fur.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/3">In July 2003 the Government invited interested parties to produce hard evidence of a problem in the UK, but to date there is no substantive evidence that such fur is entering the UK in significant and commercial quantities, if at all.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/4">The Government have been working in parallel to establish a scientific test to make it possible to reliably ascertain what species of animal any given fur sample has come from. Such a test is essential to enable trading standards officers to address allegations of mislabelling arising under the existing Trade Descriptions Act and to help establish whether domestic cat and dog fur is on sale in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/5">Last January we reported back on work commissioned on the mass spectrometry means of distinguishing the furs of domestic cat and dogs from that of other animal species. Scientific experts at the former Laboratory of the Government Chemist (LGC Ltd.) concluded that mass spectrometry was not yet sufficiently reliable.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/6">The database of fur samples on which the mass spectrometry method relies, together with the search algorithms used in testing were improved in the year since the last tests were commissioned. On the basis of new tests commissioned in autumn 2004, LGC Ltd. has concluded that from this limited trial, the use MALDI TOF Mass Spectrometry to identify domestic dog and cat hair from other species is a viable option, although a question mark remains on identifying fur which has been chemically treated.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/7">The UK keeps in touch with officials in several countries where the possible trade in domestic cat and dog fur is a concern, including the USA, Australia, France, Belgium and Sweden. We will be sharing our findings from the &quot;mass spectrometry&quot; trials with these governments and with all our European partners.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/8">The Government position remains that without hard evidence of such imports at commercial levels to the UK, we will not consider legislation and that any action would be most effective if taken at EU level. The Government continue to welcome input and evidence from interested stakeholders and will continue to share information with other governments, particularly those in Europe.</p>

	<p pid=".37WS.3/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) report on Wyre borough council's processing of claims for housing benefits was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library. In 2002&ndash;03 Wyre borough council administered approximately &pound;19 million in housing benefits. This is approximately 45 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.3/2">Wyre borough council was selected for inspection as it was taking on average just 23 days to process new housing benefit and council tax benefit claims, compared to the Department for Work and Pensions standard of 36 days. This suggested scope for BFI to identify and disseminate good practices.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.3/3">Over a two year period Wyre borough council has achieved significant improvements in both the speed and accuracy of processing claims. Its performance on the average time for processing new claims improved from 71 days in 2001&ndash;02 to 33 days in 2003&ndash;04. Its reported performance of cases processed accurately was 93 per cent. in 2001&ndash;02 rising to 98 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.3/4">Wyre borough council achieved this very good performance through a change programme that made significant changes to work processes and how work and staff were managed and monitored.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.3/5">By taking an informed and incremental approach Wyre borough council has developed its benefits service so that it now delivers a better service to customers, gives a high level of assurance to senior managers and elected members and provides development opportunities for staff.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.3/6">BFI believe that improvements in Wyre borough council's strategic management, by, for example, developing procedural guidance would further enhance performance.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.3/7">The report makes recommendations to help the council improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.3/8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to BFIs findings and recommendations.</p>
