	<p>I have today laid before the House, the Local Government Finance Report (England) 2005&ndash;06. This report establishes the amounts of revenue support grant (RSG) and non-domestic rates (NDR) to be paid to local authorities in 2005&ndash;06, and the basis of their distribution. A draft of this report was issued for consultation on 2 December 2004.</p>
	<p>I have also today laid before the House the Local Government Finance Report (England) 2003&ndash;04: Amending Report 2005. This report sets out the amended basis for distribution of RSG and NDR for 2003&ndash;04 following the incorporation of revised data into the calculations for the local government finance settlement for that year. A draft of this report was issued for consultation on 18 November 2004.</p>
	<p>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister received a total of 299 written representations within the consultation deadlines from the Local Government Association and the Association of London Government, from local authorities, local authority groups and Honourable Members, and Ministers met with delegations from six local authority associations and representative groups to discuss the proposals.</p>
	<p>Having considered the views of the local authority associations and others who have commented on the provisional settlement, I have decided to confirm my proposals on the bases of distribution for 2005&ndash;06 and the amended bases for distribution for 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p>The final figures published today for the 2005&ndash;06 settlement reflect the more accurate data and resource totals that have become available since we published our proposals, and also appropriate data corrections to reflect errors discovered by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister or notified to us by local authorities.</p>
	<p>This year's settlement represents a continued real terms increase in investment in local government, which will allow authorities to continue to deliver improving services at an affordable cost. We have provided an extra &pound;408 million in formula grant above the published plans for local government for 2005&ndash;06. As a result, total formula grant for 2005&ndash;06 will be 5.6 per cent. higher than in 2004&ndash;05. This is the eighth successive year in which Government have provided local government overall with an increase in total Government grant above inflation, and combined with specific and special grants brings the total increase in money from Government to local councils to 33 per cent. in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p>I shall be sending copies of these reports to all local authorities, and making available full supporting information on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at <a href="http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/0506/grant.htm">http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/0506/grant.htm</a></p>
	<p>Copies of the reports and related tables showing each authority's formula spending shares and its allocation of RSG and NDR, and other supporting material in the Vote Office and the Library.</p>

	<p>I have today placed in the Library a copy of the Police Grant Report (England and Wales) 2005&ndash;06 (HC 246). The report sets out my determination for 2005&ndash;06 of the aggregate amount of grants that I propose to pay under section 46(2) of the Police Act 1996, and the amount to be paid to each police authority and to the Greater London Authority for the Metropolitan Police Authority.</p>
	<p>I have also placed in the Library a copy of the Police Grant Report (England and Wales) 2003&ndash;04 (Amending Report 2004&ndash;05) (HC 247) to take account of changes to Office of National Statistics population data.</p>
	<p>General police grant allocations for each police authority for financial years 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 are set out in Table 1. Amended allocations for 2003&ndash;04 are set out in Table 2.</p>

	<p>The Government promised to report back to both Houses 12 months from my predecessor's statement to the House on 28 January 2004, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-01-28.11WS"><i>Official Report</i> Column 11&ndash;12WS</phrase> on the alleged import of domestic cat and dog fur into the UK.</p>
	<p>The Government understand the ethical abhorrence felt about this issue. Our priority remains to establish the facts about the extent of this alleged trade and to act in a measured way. To this end, we encouraged interested parties to come forward with hard evidence of such fur being on sale in the UK and we undertook work to establish a reliable scientific test to identify between different species of fur.</p>
	<p>In July 2003 the Government invited interested parties to produce hard evidence of a problem in the UK, but to date there is no substantive evidence that such fur is entering the UK in significant and commercial quantities, if at all.</p>
	<p>The Government have been working in parallel to establish a scientific test to make it possible to reliably ascertain what species of animal any given fur sample has come from. Such a test is essential to enable trading standards officers to address allegations of mislabelling arising under the existing Trade Descriptions Act and to help establish whether domestic cat and dog fur is on sale in the UK.</p>
	<p>Last January we reported back on work commissioned on the mass spectrometry means of distinguishing the furs of domestic cat and dogs from that of other animal species. Scientific experts at the former Laboratory of the Government Chemist (LGC Ltd.) concluded that mass spectrometry was not yet sufficiently reliable.</p>
	<p>The database of fur samples on which the mass spectrometry method relies, together with the search algorithms used in testing were improved in the year since the last tests were commissioned. On the basis of new tests commissioned in autumn 2004, LGC Ltd. has concluded that from this limited trial, the use MALDI TOF Mass Spectrometry to identify domestic dog and cat hair from other species is a viable option, although a question mark remains on identifying fur which has been chemically treated.</p>
	<p>The UK keeps in touch with officials in several countries where the possible trade in domestic cat and dog fur is a concern, including the USA, Australia, France, Belgium and Sweden. We will be sharing our findings from the &quot;mass spectrometry&quot; trials with these governments and with all our European partners.</p>
	<p>The Government position remains that without hard evidence of such imports at commercial levels to the UK, we will not consider legislation and that any action would be most effective if taken at EU level. The Government continue to welcome input and evidence from interested stakeholders and will continue to share information with other governments, particularly those in Europe.</p>

	<p>The provisions in the Railways Bill, which is due to complete its Commons consideration today, would devolve to the Scottish Ministers additional powers and functions to determine Scottish railway strategies; to let, monitor and manage the Scotrail franchise; and to specify rail infrastructure needs in Scotland. They will also be able to set fares and fund improvements to the railway. Only some functions&mdash;principally safety and the licensing of railway operators&mdash;will remain reserved to UK Ministers.</p>
	<p>The changes in the Railways Bill affect the executive powers of the Scottish Ministers. Responsibility for primary legislation dealing with the management and operation of railways remains reserved to the Westminster Parliament.</p>
	<p>Under the Sewel Convention the Government have committed not to vary the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. Therefore, in order to legislate in the Railways Bill the Parliament must give its consent to the Sewel motion for those aspects of the Bill which relate to devolving additional executive powers and functions to the Scottish Ministers. The motion put to the Scottish Parliament was:</p>
	<p class="italic">Railways Bill</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;That the Parliament agrees that those provisions that confer executive powers and functions on the Scottish Ministers in the Railways Bill and those that relate to devolved matters should be considered by the UK Parliament&quot;.</p>
	<p>The Scottish Parliament considered and agreed this motion on 26 January.</p>
	<p>To support these devolved responsibilities, the Secretary of State has announced that agreement has been reached with Scottish Ministers to transfer approximately &pound;325 million to the Scottish Executive which would provide sufficient funding to cover all the responsibilities being transferred by virtue of the Railways Bill.</p>
	<p>As part of this settlement the following funding transfers have been agreed:</p>
	<p class="indent">The Scottish Executive will receive a Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) transfer from the Department for Transport (DfT) of &pound;7.5 million to accompany the transfer of the majority of the Strategic Rail Authority's (SRA's) functions to the Scottish Executive. This sum represents the application of the Barnett formula (0.1023) to 75 per cent. of the relevant SRA budgets for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p class="indent">The Scottish Executive will receive a DEL transfer from DfT of &pound;302 million to fund Network Rail's Operation, Maintenance and Renewals activities in Scotland to deliver the network outputs in Scotland. This will take effect from 1 April 2006.</p>
	<p class="indent">A significant proportion of the &pound;302 million total relates to a new Scotland element of Network Rail's regulatory asset base (RAB). The disagregation of the current GB RAB into elements for Scotland and for England and Wales will be determined by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) before the end of 2005, following joint representations by DfT and the Scottish Executive. The DfT and Scottish Executive will each receive funding precisely sufficient to remunerate their respective RABs. The Scottish Executive and DfT agree that the best estimate that can be made of the RAB for Scotland in advance of the ORR's determination is that it will be very close to 10 per cent. of the RAB for Great Britain, which is the basis on which the RAB spend above is calculated.</p>
	<p>In addition, in order to fund rail enhancements the Scottish Executive will receive the following:</p>
	<p class="indent">a DEL transfer of &pound;17 million from 1 April 2006;</p>
	<p class="indent">a proportionate increase, via the application of the Barnett Formula, of future increases in DfT's spending on enhancements in England and Wales as an outcome from future Spending Reviews.</p>
	<p>Scotland will also benefit from a proportionate share of the following funding sources:</p>
	<p class="indent">A 10 per cent. share of the planned &quot;small schemes pot&quot; funding for Network Rail to take forward small enhancement schemes, as was announced in the White Paper.</p>
	<p class="indent">The undertaking of enhancement works in Scotland to enable compliance with the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p>Finally, the ORR will have the same range of responsibilities in Scotland as in England and Wales. Like the Secretary of State for Transport, Scottish Ministers will be required to provide guidance to the ORR on desired outputs, and ORR will determine the cost of delivering these outputs. To reflect the fact that in future Network Rail will be funded by two Governments, a separate binding arrangement between Scottish Ministers and Network Rail will be established, similar to the parallel binding arrangement between UK Ministers and Network Rail. No transfer of resources is required to reflect these arrangements.</p>

	<p>On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) report on Wyre borough council's processing of claims for housing benefits was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library. In 2002&ndash;03 Wyre borough council administered approximately &pound;19 million in housing benefits. This is approximately 45 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p>Wyre borough council was selected for inspection as it was taking on average just 23 days to process new housing benefit and council tax benefit claims, compared to the Department for Work and Pensions standard of 36 days. This suggested scope for BFI to identify and disseminate good practices.</p>
	<p>Over a two year period Wyre borough council has achieved significant improvements in both the speed and accuracy of processing claims. Its performance on the average time for processing new claims improved from 71 days in 2001&ndash;02 to 33 days in 2003&ndash;04. Its reported performance of cases processed accurately was 93 per cent. in 2001&ndash;02 rising to 98 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p>Wyre borough council achieved this very good performance through a change programme that made significant changes to work processes and how work and staff were managed and monitored.</p>
	<p>By taking an informed and incremental approach Wyre borough council has developed its benefits service so that it now delivers a better service to customers, gives a high level of assurance to senior managers and elected members and provides development opportunities for staff.</p>
	<p>BFI believe that improvements in Wyre borough council's strategic management, by, for example, developing procedural guidance would further enhance performance.</p>
	<p>The report makes recommendations to help the council improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to BFIs findings and recommendations.</p>
