	<p pid="b.23WS.2/1">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced as part of the Budget the introduction of a Bank Levy from <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/2">Excessive risk taking in the banking sector was a significant contributory factor in the recent financial crisis. Alongside the wider financial regulatory reform aimed at increasing the resilience of the financial sector, the levy is intended to ensure that the banking sector makes a fair contribution that reflects the risks it poses to the financial system and the wider economy, and to encourage banks to move away from riskier funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/3">The Government have today published a consultation document setting out issues around technical aspects of the design and implementation of the Bank Levy. This consultation exercise will help to ensure the levy is designed in a way that best meets its objectives, including ensuring the compliance costs faced by firms are minimised.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/4">It is proposed that draft legislation will be published in the autumn to allow for further comments from stakeholders. Final draft legislation for inclusion in the 2011 Finance Bill will be published towards the end of 2010, ahead of implementation of the levy.</p>
	<p pid="b.23WS.2/5">Copies of the consultation document are available in the Vote Office and have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	Health Select Committee Report on Commissioning

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-07-13b.24WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40541" speakername="Andrew Lansley" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health" colnum="24WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100713/wmstext/100713m0001.htm#10071323000037">
	<p pid="b.24WS.2/1">We are today laying before Parliament the Government's response (Cm 7877) to the Health Select Committee report on commissioning, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-30">30 March 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.24WS.2/2">The range of the Health Select Committee's inquiry and their report recognise the scale and complexity of the challenge we face. Commissioning is a crucial process in the NHS. It ensures that the health and care services provided effectively meet the needs of the population. It is a complex process with responsibilities ranging from assessing population needs, prioritising health outcomes, procuring products and services to managing service providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.24WS.2/3">Since the Health Select Committee's inquiry, there has been a change of administration following a general election in May 2010. The Command Paper published today therefore sets out the present coalition Government's response to the Health Select Committee's fourth report of the session 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.24WS.2/4">The White Paper, &quot;Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July 2010</phrase>, sets out our proposals for transforming the quality of commissioning by devolving decision making to local consortia of GP practices supported by an independent NHS Commissioning Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.24WS.2/5">The weaknesses in commissioning identified by the Health Select Committee are symptomatic of a system that did not emphasise the importance of clinical involvement in decisions about how the precious resources of the NHS should be spent. We have set out in the White Paper a clear sense of direction, with new rigour and the commitment to put commissioning decisions in the hands of those who are closest to patients themselves-GP practices and other primary care professionals.</p>
	<p pid="b.24WS.2/6">Today's publication is in the Library and copies are available to hon. Members from the Vote Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.24WS.4/1">European Union Health Ministers met in Brussels for an informal meeting of the EPSCO (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council ) Council on 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-06">6 July</phrase>. I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.24WS.4/2">The morning session of <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase> consisted of a discussion of EU-level collaboration on cancer. A number of member states indicated their support for greater information sharing and production of comparable data on cancer outcomes at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="b.24WS.4/3">There was also discussion of the EU's response to the A(H1N1) pandemic (building on the expert conference held on 1 and <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-02">2 July</phrase> by the Belgian presidency). Discussion focused upon the issues of vaccine procurement, and the wider EU co-ordination of pandemic response.</p>
	<p pid="b.24WS.4/4">The EU structures for responding to health emergencies (such as pandemics) were also discussed. This included a discussion of the possibility of revising the mandate of the Health Security Committee, whose mandate expires in December 2010.</p>
