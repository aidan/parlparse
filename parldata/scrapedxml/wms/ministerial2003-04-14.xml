	<p>The Government published in December a new policy framework for small business&mdash;&quot;Small Business and Government&mdash;the Way Forward&quot;. This focuses on seven core themes.

	<p>My Department has today written to the BBC to confirm a timetable for the independent review of BBC Online. The BBC is preparing a full statement about the Online approval and its own detailed assessment of performance against this. The report will be submitted to the Department by the end of June 2003, and will then be available to the independent reviewer, or reviewers, whom I expect to have appointed by that time.</p>
	<p>I will set detailed terms of reference for the independent review, which will include a public consultation, once the appointment of a reviewer has been made. These will, however, include a review of the service against the approval given and, to contribute to the coming process of BBC Charter review, an assessment of market impact together with an analysis of the role of BBC Online as part of the BBC's overall service.</p>

	<p>I am today able to announce the annual performance targets in 2003&ndash;04 for the Pension Service, the Appeals Service and Jobcentre Plus, three of the Departments for Work and Pensions' Executive Agencies. I shall announce annual performance targets for the Child Support Agency shortly. The targets I have agreed are set out below.</p>
	<p>Further information on the plans of each of these agencies in 2003&ndash;04 is contained in their individual business plans, which have been published today alongside the Jobcentre Plus Performance and Resource Agreement. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p>I am also able to announce the annual performance targets in 2003&ndash;04 for the Disability and Carers Directorate, the business unit within the Department for Work and Pensions which is responsible for disability rights and for the delivery of disability and carers benefits. The key targets which I have agreed for the Directorate are also set out below. Further information on the plans of the Directorate in 2003&ndash;04 is contained in its business plan, which has also been published today. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p>The Appeals Service</p>
	<p><i>Waiting times</i> The average waiting time for an appeal to be heard will be no more than 13 weeks from the time of receipt by the Appeals Service. <sup>1</sup></p>
	<p>The number of cases over 24 weeks old as at 1 April 2003, will be reduced by at least 15 per cent. by 31 March 2004.</p>
	<p>For cases returned by the Commissioner, the average waiting time for an appeal to be re-heard will be no more than 10 weeks from the date of return to the Appeals Service. <sup>2</sup></p>
	<p class="italic">Local variations</p>
	<p>The range of waiting time variations between local offices will be reduced by a factor of 5 per cent.</p>
	<p><sup>1</sup> Excludes stayed cases awaiting decision in lead cases in a higher court (the effective date will commence from withdrawal of stay being notified).</p>

	<p>Pay Pension Credit to at least 2.4 million pensioner households by April 2004.</p>
	<p>Pay the guarantee element of Pension Credit to at least 1.9 million pensioner households by April 2004.</p>
	<p>Convert all Minimum Income Guarantee recipients to Pension Credit by the beginning of October 2003.</p>
	<p>Reduce losses as a result of fraud and error to no more than 4 per cent. of benefit paid.</p>
	<p>Ensure that 88 per cent. of calls to The Pension Service Pension Centres are answered by Customer agents and that no more than 1 per cent. of attempted calls receive an engaged tone or message.</p>
	<p>Achieve a Pension Credit accuracy rate of 94 per cent.</p>
	<p>Achieve a Retirement Pension claims accuracy rate of 98 per cent.</p>
	<p>Jobcentre Plus</p>
	<p><i>Helping people into work</i> To achieve a total points score of 7,681,000 based on the job entry outcomes Jobcentre Plus achieves. The points score system focuses efforts and resources on helping into work people in priority groups such as lone parents, disabled people and those in the most disadvantaged areas. For each person that Jobcentre Plus places in work it will earn a point score ranging from 12 for, for example, a customer on long term Incapacity Benefit to a single point for someone who is already employed. See Annex 1 for details.</p>
	<p><i>Tackling fraud and error</i> By March 2004 to reduce losses from fraud and error in working age Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance to no more than 6.9 per cent. of the monetary value of these benefits paid during the year.</p>
	<p><i>Helping employers fill their vacancies</i> At least 82 per cent. of employers placing their vacancies with Jobcentre Plus will have a positive outcome.</p>
	<p><i>Business delivery</i> To ensure that specified key Jobcentre Plus business processes are delivered efficiently, accurately and to specified standards in 88 per cent. of cases.</p>
	<p><i>Serving our customers well</i> To achieve an 83 per cent. customer service level in the delivery of the standards set out in the Customers' and Employers' Charters.</p>
	<p>Annex 1</p>
	<p>The following table explains how points will be allocated to job entry outcomes when calculating how Jobcentre Plus performs against the target of helping people into work.</p>
