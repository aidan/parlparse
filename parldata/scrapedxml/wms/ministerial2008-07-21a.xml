<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-21a.72WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="72WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080721/wmstext/80721m0003.htm#08072119000268">
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/1">I wish to respond to the publication entitled &quot;Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;2007&quot;, which was presented as a House of Commons Paper (933) today. Copies have been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/2">This annual statistical report meets the requirement in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to inform Parliament about the licensed use of animals for experimental or other scientific purposes. It also forms the basis for meeting periodic reporting requirements at EU level. A hard copy is available and supplementary information with additional tables is also available on the Home Office website.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/3">The statistical report shows an overall increase over the previous year of 6 per cent. in the number of procedures undertaken. The total number of procedures was 3.2 million, an increase of 189,500 over the previous year. There has now been a relatively small increase for the sixth year running and is the highest total since 1992. A number of factors, such as investment in research and development and strategic funding priorities, determine the overall level of scientific procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/4">Non-toxicological procedures accounted for about 87 per cent. of the procedures carried out. These included fundamental research in human and veterinary medicine to improve understanding of disease mechanisms and possible therapeutic options, and development of vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/5">Most toxicological studies (78 per cent.) were for the safety and efficacy testing of new drugs and medicines and the majority of all procedures (87 per cent.) were performed in order to carry out legal or statutory requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/6">In keeping with previous years, those procedures that used mice or rats (or other rodents) were the great majority at 83 per cent. Those using fish amounted to 10 per cent. and those using birds, 4 per cent. The total of all procedures using dogs, cats, horses and non-human primates, that is, those species offered special protection by the Act, was less than 1 per cent. of the total.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/7">Genetically normal animals were used in about 1.73 million regulated procedures, up 86,200 (5 per cent.) on 2006 figures. This increase is associated with mice used in fundamental studies. However, this is an overall decrease of 2.27 million (23 per cent.) since 1995. Genetically modified animals (nearly all rodents) were used in 1.15 million regulated procedures representing, 36 per cent. of all procedures for 2007 (compared with 34 per cent. in 2006 and 8 per cent in 1995).</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/8">Advances in the opportunities to use genetically altered animals for new areas of biomedical research means that the trend of increased production and use of genetically altered animals has continued. It allows a more precise and often less invasive study of physiological studies and disease mechanisms that was previously possible. Most of the animals concerned are mice, which appear and live as normal. Many are only used in breeding programmes. In fact just over a third of all procedures in 2007 were accounted for by breeding procedures (37 per cent.) conducted in 2007, for the production of harmful mutant and genetically modified animals. Mainly mice (93 per cent.) and fish (6 per cent.) were used in these procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/9">I should point out in relation to the statistics that the Home Office, as regulatory authority under the 1986 Act, does cap the overall amount of animal research and testing which takes place, the imperative being to authorise work which is justified whilst minimising the numbers of animals used and any animal suffering that may be caused.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/10">Therefore we ensure, in carrying out our licensing function, that the provisions of the Act are rigorously applied in each programme of work. All animal use must be justified, and that for each particular programme of work the number of animals used, and the suffering caused must be minimised.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/11">The statistical report and supplementary information can be found at: <a href="http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/animal-research/publications-and-reference/statistics/?version=l">http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice. gov.uk/animal-research/publications-and-reference/statistics/?version=l</a></p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/12">I am also pleased to inform the House that I have today placed in the Library the annual report of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate for the year 2007. This is the fourth annual report published by the Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/13">Publication of the Inspectorate report honours a commitment given by the Government in response to a recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures in July 2002 that more information should be made available about the work of the Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/14">The report explains the Inspectorate's role in assessing, and advising the Secretary of State on applications for personal and project licences and for certificates of designation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. It also provides details of the inspection system through which compliance with licence authorities granted under the 1986 Act is monitored, and about visiting patterns and practice and the number of visits carried out during the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/15">This report explains the important role of inspectors in gathering and transmitting information on good practice and provides examples of the many events and initiatives to which the Inspectorate made significant contributions during the year. In addition, this year's report contains special features on the generation, breeding and maintenance of genetically altered mice and on the planning and construction of buildings in which scientific work involving animals is to be conducted.</p>
	<p pid="a.72WS.1/16">I commend the Inspectorate's report to the attention of Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.74WS.5/1">The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-26">26 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.5/2">The Act applies to companies incorporated under companies legislation, other corporations including public bodies incorporated by statute such as local authorities or NHS bodies; organisations incorporated by Royal Charter; limited liability partnerships and all other partnerships that are employers; Crown bodies such as Government Departments; and police forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.5/3">An organisation is guilty of the new offence if the way in which its activities are managed or organised causes a death and this amounts to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care to the deceased. A substantial part of the breach must have been in the way activities were managed by senior management.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.5/4">The majority of the Act was implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April 2008</phrase>, with the exception of section 2(1)(d) which makes the duty of care a custody provider owes to a person who is detained a relevant duty of care, and section 10 on publicity orders where we await guidelines to be issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.5/5">Procedures for caring for some of society's most vulnerable or volatile people are highly complex. That is why it was made clear to Parliament when it passed this legislation that a period of three to five years would be needed for custody providers to prepare for implementation of Section 2(1)(d).</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.5/6">We are publishing a report today which discusses the progress made to date by the various custody providers and what remains to be done. While implementing the Act provides a useful catalyst and driver, reducing deaths in custody is a core part of long-term work by the Government together with custody providers, and this long-term agenda is reflected in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.5/7">The report includes developments in Northern Ireland for which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has responsibility under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.74WS.5/8">Copies of the report will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The report is also available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office and on the internet at: <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/corporate-manslaughter-progress-custody.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/corporate-manslaughter -progress-custody.htm</a></p>

	<p pid="a.75WS.1/1">In February this year I published the independent review of the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-02-25.68"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 February 2008, Col. 68WS</phrase>). I did so in order to canvass the opinions of those both inside and outside Parliament with an interest in this important area of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.1/2">Ministers have now had the opportunity to consider both the recommendations of the review and the responses of stakeholders, and I am pleased to announce today that we have decided to implement the recommended reforms. We are therefore taking steps to set up a new tripartite body, to be known as the Ministerial Council on Deaths in Custody, incorporating senior decision-makers, experts and practitioners in the field. This extended, cross-sector approach to deaths in custody will allow for better learning and sharing of lessons across the custodial sectors, and will benefit from direct links to Ministers, as the ultimate decision-makers. The reforms underline our commitment to reducing the number of people who die in our custodial institutions and the new structures will be subject to review after three years to evaluate their impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.75WS.1/3">The intention is that the new Ministerial Council will be in place by early 2009. Further information on the work of the forum to date, and copies of the independent review, are available on the internet at <a href="http://www.preventingcustodydeaths.org.uk">www. preventingcustodydeaths.org.uk</a>. Copies of the independent review have also been made available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
