<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-01-27a.11WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" speakername="Kevan Jones" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="11WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090127/wmstext/90127m0001.htm#09012750000067">
	<p pid="a.11WS.5/1">My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> and I wish to make the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.5/2" class="indent">Military training takes place within part of the Dartmoor National Park under the terms of a licence granted by the land owner, the Duchy of Cornwall. The current 21-year licence is due to end in 2012. The Ministry of Defence wishes to continue to use this land to deliver military training for the Royal Marines and other armed forces based principally in the south-west of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.5/3" class="indent">The Government have a duty to ensure that the armed forces are provided with first class training facilities. The rugged terrain and at times hostile weather of Dartmoor provides an ideal environment in which service personnel, particularly Royal Marines, can acquire and maintain skills that enable them to carry out difficult and dangerous tasks across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.5/4" class="indent">Our two Departments agreed that prior to the renegotiation of the licence, the Ministry of Defence would establish that there is a continuing need for military training on Dartmoor and that the land would continue to be managed in a sustainable manner. Two separate assessments of military need both concluded that there was a long-term defence requirement and that no suitable alternative land was available within mainland UK. An environmental assessment carried out by independent consultants in 2006-07 considered the economic, social and environmental effects of continued military use at current permitted levels. The reports identify that defence use is carried out in a sustainable manner and with regard to national park purposes. Accordingly, we agree that the licence renegotiation can proceed in order to put in place a licence for a further 21-year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.5/5" class="indent">In support of the Ministry of Defence's continuing use of the estate for that period, DEFRA has asked the Ministry of Defence to provide a report at the mid-point which would be a stocktake of the training area's environmental management system, which includes environmental management tools and monitoring, usage data and public access. It will not include a further justification of continuing military need. During the stocktake the Ministry of Defence will consult with relevant stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.5/6" class="indent">In coming to this decision, both Ministers have taken into account the ongoing constructive engagement of the Ministry of Defence in improving public access to, and the environmental conservation of Dartmoor. DEFRA looks forward to the Ministry of Defence building on its record of support for national park purposes and for local communities through the sustainable management of the Dartmoor estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.5/7" class="indent">We confirm that the Dartmoor Steering Group, which is sponsored by both Departments, will continue to act as the best forum for reconciliation of the requirements of military training, conservation and public access and take forward the good work that has already been undertaken under its auspices.</p>

	<p pid="a.12WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-07-22.83"><i>Official Report</i>, column 83WS</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase> announced the publication of a consultation document on the Strategic Siting Assessment process and criteria for new nuclear power stations and an accompanying environmental study.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.2/2">A year on from the Nuclear White Paper I am pleased to announce today the publication of the Government response to the consultation and study, which sets out the process for taking forward the siting of new nuclear power stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.2/3">The Strategic Siting Assessment (SSA) is a process for identifying and assessing sites that are strategically suitable for the deployment of new nuclear power stations by the end of 2025. The SSA will provide an opportunity for the Government to assess the suitability of nominated sites at the national level. Sites that have been assessed as being suitable will be listed on the Nuclear National Policy Statement (NPS), which will provide guidance to the forthcoming Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC).</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.2/4">The Government response contains an outline of the key themes that arose from the consultation on the SSA process and criteria, and the environmental study in relation to the criteria, together with the Government's response and the finalised criteria. It also summarises comments on the habitats screening report and the Government's response. The screening report was not the subject of public consultation. Views were instead sought from interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.2/5">In response to points made in the consultation, the Government response contains guidance to nominators who wish to nominate a site to be assessed within the SSA, and a nomination form. Nominations to the SSA are due by <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.2/6">The Government will publish nominations and the public will have a month to give the Government their initial comments, prior and in addition to public consultation later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.2/7">The assessment will be made by Government using the advice of specialists including regulators and others. The output of the SSA will be a draft list of the sites that Government have assessed to be strategically suitable, and these will form a key component of the draft Nuclear NPS, which will undergo public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.2/8">Today's announcement underlines the Government's commitment to the development of new nuclear capacity and maintains the necessary momentum towards our climate change and energy security goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.12WS.2/9">Copies of the Government response will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses immediately following publication.</p>

	<p pid="a.14WS.2/1">I will today lay before the House the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Command Paper on Prospects for the European Union in 2009. Copies will be placed in the Library of the House. Additional copies can also be obtained from the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. A copy will also be available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.2/2">This Command Paper provides an overview of the priorities of the Czech presidency for the first half of 2009, as set out in their Work Programme, which is available at: www.eu2009.cz. Under the overarching theme of &quot;Europe without Barriers&quot;, the Czech presidency will focus on three key priorities: the Economy, Energy policy and &quot;Europe in the world&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.2/3">The top priority for the Czech presidency is the EU's response to the financial crisis. The presidency will promote market liberalisation as a fundamental means of boosting growth and competitiveness and thereby meeting the challenges of the economic downturn. The UK will work closely with the presidency to drive forward timely and targeted measures to lessen the impact of the downturn on families and businesses across Europe. A concerted and co-ordinated European approach will deliver a far greater impact on jobs and growth in each country than that which any country could achieve by acting alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.2/4">In order to develop the foundations for the EU's long-term energy security, the UK will work with the Czech presidency to hasten progress towards a well functioning internal market, the diversification of supply and the promotion of energy efficiency. Following the historic agreement on the 2020 climate package at the December European Council 2008, the presidency will also maintain the momentum on international negotiations in the run up to the United Nations framework convention on climate change in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.2/5">The Czech presidency has a varied external agenda, including a strong focus on the eastern partnership and the western Balkans. The UK fully supports the presidency in its commitment to strengthen co-operation between the EU and eastern Europe and the Caucasus. The presidency has also committed to holding summits with key partners including the US and Pakistan. The UK will be working closely with the Czech Republic to carry forward agreed priorities with these and other key international partners.</p>
