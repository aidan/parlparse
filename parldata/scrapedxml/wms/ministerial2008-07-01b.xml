	<p pid="b.48WS.2/1">The House will recall that on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-29">29 April 2008</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced the deployment of the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles (2 Rifles) to Kosovo during June as part of our existing commitment to the NATO/EU-shared pan-Balkans Operational Reserve Force (ORF).</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.2/2">During this period the security situation in Kosovo has remained calm. There were no significant incidents of inter-ethnic unrest and a number of key political dates passed peacefully. In particular, the implementation of a new constitution represented an historic moment in Kosovo's progress towards establishing itself as a stable, democratic and multi-ethnic state.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.2/3">Against this background, NATO has now assessed that its Kosovo force has the capability to maintain a safe and secure environment without further recourse to the ORF. As a result, I am pleased to announce that 2 Rifles completed its mission on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase> and is in the process of returning to UK. The UK will, however, remain committed to the NATO/EU pan-Balkans ORF until the end of this year, at a lower readiness.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.2/4">The deployment of the UK ORF Battalion confirmed yet again the professionalism of our armed forces and demonstrated our commitment to the security of Kosovo during a politically sensitive period.</p>

	<p pid="b.48WS.4/1">I am pleased to inform the House that the Department is releasing the final report of the mild Traumatic Brain Injury Project Team established by the Surgeon General in June 2007. A copy will also be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.4/2">I previously informed the House of the conclusions of the project team in my written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-15">15 January 2008</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-01-15.23"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 23-24WS</phrase>). Release of the final report provides further rationale and explanation of the key conclusions that:</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.4/3" class="indent">There is no evidence that mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is having an adverse effect on operational capability within the UK Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.4/4" class="indent">The majority of cases of mTBI become symptom-free within two to three weeks and 80 per cent. are symptom-free within three months.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.4/5" class="indent">The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) has identified 585 cases of casualties between February 2003 and November 2007 with Traumatic Brain Injury (whether mild, moderate or severe) out of some 36,000 referrals to deployed UK operational emergency departments. This represents 1.6 per cent. of all medical presentations during the period, and 0.5 per cent. of the deployed UK military population.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.4/6">The report also provides further detail of the actions we have already taken to address mBTI, including the roll-out of a diagnostic and surveillance tool to deployed theatres, and the establishment of a treatment protocol covering information for deployed service personnel, telephone-based support for patients, and outpatient and inpatient treatment at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Headley Court, which becomes the DMS lead centre for mTBI, re-enforced by ongoing epidemiological and research findings.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.4/7">The report also describes current research in mTBI relevant to the military environment underway at DSTL, South Tees NHS Trust emergency department, and King's college, London.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.4/8">Finally, the report and associated historical review and literature review documents will be placed in the Library of the House. They provide a sense of perspective, explaining that mTBI is almost certainly not a new phenomenon, and that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions between organic and psychological effects in the case of brain injury.</p>
	<p pid="b.48WS.4/9">As I explained in my previous statement, research continues both here and in the US. Throughout our research we are in touch with United States developments, and collaborate with its researchers as appropriate. I shall keep the House informed of any further significant developments.</p>

	<p pid="b.49WS.2/3" class="indent">We have now located the records concerned. The answer was drafted by the Overseas Territories Department and approved by the FCO Minister concerned in the normal way. The background to this answer states that assurances on this issue were given at the annual British Indian Ocean Territory US-UK political-military talks in June 2003, and that officials had tested this assurance with the US embassy in London, the State Department in Washington and the US Commanding Officer on Diego Garcia.</p>

	<p pid="b.50WS.5/2">In this initial phase of work, views on the goals and challenges that potential transport policies should help meet have been obtained from over 250 organisations throughout the country, as well as from over 600 members of the public who have participated in citizens' panels. Today my officials have sent a letter to all the organisations that participated summarising their contributions. A copy of this letter has been placed in the House Library.</p>

In taking this work forward we will also take account of the cross-Government work on developing policies and proposals to deliver the UK's first series of carbon budgets.</p>
