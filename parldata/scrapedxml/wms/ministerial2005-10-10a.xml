	<p pid="a.1WS.5/1">My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs has made the following written ministerial statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-10">10 August 2005</phrase> I published the Department's response to the consultation paper <i>Making Simple CFAs a Reality</i> published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-29">29 June 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/3">The paper <i>New Regulation for CFAs&mdash;A summary of responses to the consultation paper Making Simple CFAs a Reality, DCA's conclusions and new regulations sets out the Department's conclusions on the simplification of the CFAs and related secondary legislation. The paper includes drafts of the regulations, which revoke the current secondary legislation governing CFAs, collective conditional fee agreement regulations (CCFA) and new set of simplified membership organisation regulations. These regulations will be laid before Parliament separately.</i></p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/4">The current CFA regulations are unnecessarily complex and opaque and duplicate regulation already performed by the Law Society. Removing unnecessary regulation will apply to all CFAs which are used across a range of civil cases and will put into place the Government's commitment to introduce better regulation and strip out unnecessary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/5" class="indent">The existing CFA and CCFA regulations will be revoked and the new simplified Membership Organisation regulations introduced from <phrase class="date" code="">1 November 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/6" class="indent">The primary legislation (section 27 of the access to Justice Act 1999) will provide the minimum government legislative framework needed for the use of CFAs by legal representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/7" class="indent">Primary responsibility for client care will be focused on solicitors through Law Society's regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/8" class="indent">DCA has been working closely with the Law Society on improvements to its guidance and rules and the Law Society plans to amend its rules and publish new CFA model agreements to coincide with the changes to regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/9">Copies of the paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It is also available on the Department for Constitutional Affairs' web-site <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/">www.dca.gov.uk/</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.2WS.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September</phrase> we published a consultation paper: &quot;Hearing the Relatives of Murder and Manslaughter Victims&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.3/2">The Government believe that while all criminal justice agencies are making progress, for example through the &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot; programme, more needs to be done to inform and engage victims and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.3/3">Our consultation paper outlines proposals for piloting ways of providing such assistance to bereaved relatives of homicide victims by:</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.3/4" class="indent">(a) providing advice and support to relatives during the trial, and;</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.3/5" class="indent">(b) helping bereaved relatives make an oral statement to the court after</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.3/6" class="indent">conviction but before sentencing about the effect of the crime on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.3/7">The Government intend that the pilot should address a broad range of options for delivering these functions, offering the maximum possible choice to the bereaved. The choices should include an independent advocate, for either or both functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.3/8">This initiative is part of a larger package of measures to support the victims of crime, which will be announced as they become ready.</p>
	<p pid="a.2WS.3/9">Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.3WS.1/1">The Government have today laid before Parliament the following instrument: Solicitors (Compensation for Inadequate Professional Services) Order 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/2">The Order, made under paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 1A to the Solicitors Act 1974, will raise the maximum limit on the compensation which the Law Society's Council may direct a solicitor to pay on a complaint of inadequate professional service. The limit is raised from &pound;5,000 to &pound;15,000 with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January</phrase>, consumers seeking compensation for inadequate professional service will be able to benefit from the increased compensation level which the Law Society can order and avoid the necessity of automatically having to take court action in order to claim redress in those cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/4">The revised limit will apply to those cases where a complaint of inadequate professional service is made to the Law Society by the complainant after <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/5">My Department and the Law Society are in agreement that raising the compensation level would be in the interest of, and welcomed by, the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/6">At present, if the compensation claimed is greater than &pound;5,000 the Law Society cannot deal with it. This means that a complainant frequently has to retain the services of a further solicitor in order to get redress from the solicitor who generated the original complaint. This can be a lengthy and expensive process for a consumer. Raising the limit will enable a far greater proportion of complainants to obtain adequate redress without the need to resort to court proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.1/7">A copy of the Order to raise the compensation limit has been placed in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.6WS.1/1">The Government are today publishing the detailed programme for commencement of parts 1&ndash;4, 6 and 7 of the Housing Act 2004. Appendix 1 sets out a phased introduction of the provisions from November this year leading to a common commencement date of <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2006</phrase> for all these provisions except for certain enforcement measures and the new tenancy deposit arrangements, which will follow later in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.1/2">The Government have previously announced a provisional timetable for introducing these provisions as from late autumn 2005. We are now in a position to confirm the full timetable, starting with the laying of the HHSRS regulations next month and completing tenant deposit protection in October 2006. This will maintain the momentum established with local authorities and landlord bodies over recent months to equip each to carry out their responsibilities effectively and at least cost to local taxpayers and tenants as from the due commencement date.</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.1/3">By announcing this timetable, we are able to give certainty as to when the new provisions will be coming into force and enable all sides to prepare fully. The Government will continue to work with local authorities and landlords through the IDeA to complete the current training programme and to extend the extensive local authority/landlord series of discussions that have proved so successful locally in getting the two sides to agree the basis on which applications are to be handled and funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.1/4">Making the secondary legislation available early in draft form, alongside guidance, and then laying the instruments in good time will do a great deal to inform discussions and ensure a wider understanding of the details and operation of the new system than would have been the case with an earlier commencement date.</p>
	<p pid="a.6WS.1/5">ODPM is to appoint a contractor who will undertake work with local authorities to establish a baseline as from later this year and to monitor and measure the impact of the new licensing regime on the private rented sector. Officials will write to local authorities when an appointment has been made and provide details of when the main fieldwork periods will be.</p>

	<p pid="a.8WS.1/1">The 2005 UN world summit took place in New York from 14&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September</phrase>. My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for International Development and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs attended for the Government. At the initiative of the UK and other UN member states, the summit included a session devoted to financing for developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/2">Overall, the summit delivered a worthwhile package of reforms and commitments. The full text of the outcome document is available at <a href="http://www.un.org/summit2005">www.un.org/summit2005</a>. Negotiations on the document were at times difficult, reflecting the ambitious agenda and divergence of views between UN member states on several issues. As EU presidency, the UK played an important role in these negotiations. Follow-up work is now underway in several areas to implement the agreements reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/3">The reforms agreed included:</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/4" class="indent">Agreement on the responsibility to protect, acknowledging that the international community should act if states fail to protect their populations from the worst atrocities:</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/5">genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity;</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/6" class="indent">Good language on development and climate change, with several important Gleneaglesoutcomes endorsed and new EU commitments welcomed by the broader UN membership.These include the need to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals andto address the special needs of Africa;</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/7" class="indent">Agreement to create by the end of this year a new peace-building commission, to close an institutional gap in the UN's conflict architecture and assist countries emerge from conflict;</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/8" class="indent">Agreement to establish a new human rights council, to replace the much-maligned Commission for Human Rights;</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/9" class="indent">Endorsement of further work to strengthen UN effectiveness in operational activities for tackling humanitarian crises and to ensure more coherent international institutional arrangements for environmental action;</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/10" class="indent">Endorsement of UN secretariat reforms underway and a mandate to the Secretary-General to make proposals for further reforms in such areas as ethics, accountability/oversight, and financial and human resource management; and</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/11" class="indent">Unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestation and, separately, unanimous adoption by the Security Council of the UK's Security Council resolution to prohibit by law incitement of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/12">In some areas the outcome text did not meet our aspirations. Stronger language on terrorism, stating that the targeted killing of civilians is never justified and constitutes an act of terrorism, proved out of reach. Efforts to secure strong language on non-proliferation and disarmament (following disappointment at the non-proliferation treaty review conference) were unsuccessful. The EU pushed for more extensive reforms of the UN secretariat. Furthermore, opposition from some countries prevented more detailed modalities being agreed for the new human rights council.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/13">Some have criticised the summit's outcome document as modest. However, as the Prime Minister said in his speech at the summit, &quot;if we did what we have agreed on doubling aid, on opening up trade, on debt relief, on HIV/AIDS and malaria, on conflict prevention so that never again would the world stand by, helpless when genocide struck, our modesty would surprise. There would be more democracy, less oppression. More freedom, less terrorism. More growth, less poverty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.1/14">The Government are committed to the full and early implementation of the reforms. We will continue to work towards achieving reforms where we wanted to see greater progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.9WS.5/1">Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires me to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on my exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.5/2">The 2005 Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. The second three month period ended on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-10">10 September</phrase>. During the period <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-11">11 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-10">10 September</phrase>, I made an order with the permission of the court under section 3(1) <i>(a)</i> of the 2005 Act on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-05">5 September 2005</phrase> in respect of a British national.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.5/3">I have revoked nine of the orders which I made in the previous quarter against individuak who were formerly certified under section 21(1) of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.5/4">There are therefore three control orders currently in force.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.5/5">I have refused three requests to modify the obligations in the control orders which I have made. A right of appeal exists in section 10 of the 2005 Act against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an obligation contained in a control order. None of those subject to a control order has exercised this right in respect of the refusals mentioned above.</p>
