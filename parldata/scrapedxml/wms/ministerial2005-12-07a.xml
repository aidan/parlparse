<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-12-07a.91WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence" colnum="91WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/wmstext/51207m01.htm#51207m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.91WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November</phrase>, my colleague Lord Drayson, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and Minister for Defence Procurement, told the other place that he would report on the lessons learned following the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict in the case of 7 members and former members of the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment who were charged with murder and violent disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.2/2">It is worth reminding the House of the very difficult, demanding and hostile operational circumstances faced by the investigators of the Royal Military Police in Iraq in May 2003. It was in the immediate aftermath of the war fighting phase where there was an almost complete absence of civil governance, law and order and where there was widespread looting and civil disobedience. There were more than 2&frac34; million people in Basrah and Maysan Provinces who were very different in culture, language and religious background and the majority was also highly suspicious and often hostile. The RMP were required to support the deployed force, act as the local police for the Iraqi population and commence the huge undertaking of rebuilding the Iraqi police and prison services. The operational environment and situation facing the RMP cannot be equated to that faced by a civilian police force in the UK. In the first 8 months of 2003, 9 members of the RMP were killed on active service in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.2/3">Against that backdrop, the Adjutant General has conducted a comprehensive review of the case and the comments of the Judge Advocate General. He has concluded that many of the issues identified have already been addressed and action taken, but there remains room for improvement. The Adjutant General has identified: the need for a review of RMP resources to meet operational demands now and in the future; better and continuous liaison between RMP investigators and the Army Prosecuting Authority; and the need to drive down delays in the system in order to ensure the timely delivery of justice. These will also be taken forward, and further improvements will be delivered through the Armed Forces Bill. In the meantime, we continue to have full confidence in the professional ability of the Royal Military Police to conduct investigations of this complexity, seriousness, and in the context of a potentially hostile environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.2/4">The Adjutant General has also confirmed that all 7 defendants&mdash;both serving and former soldiers&mdash;were afforded very comprehensive support. Each had a Unit Defending Officer who could be contacted at any time, Legal Aid (including leading and junior Counsel) and time off for those still serving to prepare for their court martial. Personal issues and career consequences are always assessed fairly and kept under continuous review in such cases. The assertion by one of the defendants that he had been &quot;hung out to dry&quot; is unfounded.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.2/5">On the questions raised about the payments made to Iraqi witnesses. This was done by the Military Court Service. The procedures and the level of expenses paid were in line with the standard practices applied in the civil process in the UK. Overall it is anticipated that the total cost of the trial will be around &pound;4 million although final legal bills have to be submitted.</p>

	<p pid="a.92WS.2/1">Further to my statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October 2005</phrase> on a revised programme for implementing the provisions in the Housing Act 2004, I am now in a position to announce completion of most of the first phase of the programme which includes parts one to four and seven of the 2004 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/2" class="italic">Housing Health and Safety Rating System</p>

The accompanying volumes of statutory guidance on the operation of the rating system, and on the use of the enforcement provisions in Part one, were laid in draft at the same time, in accordance with section nine of the Act. Part one applies to all residential premises and the laying of these Regulations and the draft guidance makes clear to those affected by the new provisions what is likely to be expected of them as from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/4" class="italic">Private Rented Sector Licensing</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/5">Today we have placed on ODPM's website <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/housing/consult/">http://www.odpm.gov.uk/housing/consult/</a>, draft statutory instruments covering the licensing of HMOs and other private rented sector properties. These give effect to decisions announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October</phrase> following extensive consultation with local authorities, managing agents, landlords and tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/6">We will take detailed comments into account before laying the final regulations at the end of January as indicated in the timetable published in October 2005. We want to make sure that the provisions are drafted in such a way that they are widely understood by those with responsibility to operate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/7">The draft SIs include: The Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (Prescribed Descriptions) (England) Order, The Licensing (HMOs and Other Houses) (Applications, Standards, Publication of Designation and Keeping of Registers) (England) Regulations 2005, The Selective Licensing (Specified Exemptions) (England) Order, The Housing (Interim Management Orders (Prescribed Circumstances) (England) Order and The Management of HMOs (England) Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/8">The Government expect to lay these Orders in the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>. They are expected to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/9" class="italic">Empty Dwelling Management Orders</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/10">The consultation exercise on Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) closed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-14">14 October</phrase>. In December we will publish our response to the consultation and set out our proposals for secondary legislation. We expect to lay the instruments in the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>, and again expect these to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
