<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-24a.9WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" speakername="Kitty Ussher" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="9WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071024/wmstext/71024m0001.htm#07102443000035">
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/1">The Government's Child Trust Fund initiative is designed to strengthen the saving habit and ensure that at age 18 every young person, regardless of family background, will have access to a financial asset. The scheme will also help bring financial education to life for children, providing a practical and real life example of saving. The latest Child Trust Fund account opening figures, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-28">28 September</phrase>, highlight the continuing success of the Child Trust Fund, with three-quarters of parents opening an account for their child. Data published today also reveal that almost a quarter of children have already received additional contributions into their accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/2">However, there is more to do to reach new parents and to encourage the further involvement of parents whose children have accounts. The Government are continuing their efforts to raise awareness of the scheme and to encourage parents and families to engage with their child's account, by saving for their child's future and by using the Child Trust Fund to help teach children about money and saving.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/3">From today, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will send out reminder letters to all parents who have not used their child's voucher eight months after it has been issued. In addition, HMRC have already begun to roll out a programme of training for Voluntary and Community Sector organisations which will help them to provide face to face support for less financially confident parents. HMRC will also consult from today on whether the requirement for parents to send in their vouchers in order to open an account might be removed, in order to make the account opening process easier.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/4">I will be writing to all Members of Parliament this week with details of Child Trust Fund account opening figures for their constituencies, so that they may consider what more can be done locally to encourage parents to make the most of the opportunities the Child Trust Fund represents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-24a.11WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" speakername="Jack Straw" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor" colnum="11WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071024/wmstext/71024m0001.htm#07102443000037">
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October</phrase> I made a written ministerial statement to this House stating my intention to adopt, on a voluntary basis, the provisions of the Constitutional Reform Act relating to a new appointments process for Justices of the United Kingdom Supreme Court. A typographical error meant that the Statement referred to my adoption of Section 8 of the Constitutional Reform Act rather than the relevant parts of the Act, which are Sections 25 to 31 of Part 3 and Schedule 8. I am therefore issuing the amended statement below to correct this mistake.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/2">The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 makes provision for a new appointments process for Justices of the United Kingdom Supreme Court. The Act brings these provisions into effect once the Court is operational. The new arrangements aim to increase public confidence in the appointments process by creating greater transparency of appointments and improving competition for these positions. I believe that it is sensible to adopt the new process from now on. This is because those newly appointed to the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords will spend the majority of their career in the Supreme Court</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/3">I will therefore adopt Sections 25 to 31 of Part 3 and Schedule 8 of the Constitutional Reform Act on a voluntary basis, as any new appointments made will help to determine the character of the Court. This decision does not impact upon other provisions within the Act that will come into force when the Supreme Court opens for business in October 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.2/4">A selection commission will be formed when vacancies arise. This will be composed of the President and Deputy President of the Supreme Court and members of the appointment bodies for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. All new judges appointed to the Supreme Court after its creation will not be members of the House of Lords; they will become Justices of the Supreme Court.</p>
