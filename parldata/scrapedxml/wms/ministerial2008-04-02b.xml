<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-04-02b.49WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1483" speakername="Kevin Brennan" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families" colnum="49WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/wmstext/80402m0001.htm#08040249000292">
	<p pid="b.49WS.5/1">I am today announcing the outcome of a review of the suspension of adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.5/2">In June 2004, the then Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" name="Margaret Hodge">the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase>, announced the suspension of adoptions in response to concerns raised and investigated by officials from the DfES (now DCSF) who visited Cambodia, by the British Embassy in Cambodia and, separately, by other stakeholders about the intercountry adoption process in Cambodia.</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.5/3">A review of the suspension was announced last year and was carried out by my Department. The purpose of the review was to update the information on which the suspension was based, to find out what concerns, if any, remain valid and whether there are any other concerns about practices taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.5/4">The review work assessed the current situation in Cambodia regarding intercountry adoption, including what changes, if any, to practice and legislation have been made in the three years since the temporary suspension was introduced. The review also took account of Cambodia's accession to the Hague Convention (on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993).</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.5/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-12">12 December</phrase>, the UK lodged an objection to Cambodia's accession to the Hague Convention, in accordance with article 44 of the convention. Cambodia's accession to the convention therefore has no effect as regards relations between the UK and Cambodia.</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.5/6">Evidence from the review demonstrates that: adoption legislation, practice and procedure in Cambodia remain insufficient to ensure the proper protection of children and their families; lifting the suspension at the current time would expose Cambodian children and their families to an increased risk of improper practices that are contrary to the principles of the Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Hague Convention) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.5/7">The suspension of adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents therefore still remains in place. I will of course consider the effect of any changes to adoption legislation and practice in Cambodia in keeping the suspension under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.49WS.5/8">I am also announcing today the outline timetable for the implementation of the statutory provisions relating to the restrictions of adoptions from abroad in the Children and Adoption Act 2006. I intend to implement sections 9 and 10 and, in so far as they are not already in force, sections 11 and 12 of the 2006 Act in summer 2008.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-04-02b.52WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1483" speakername="Kevin Brennan" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families" colnum="52WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/wmstext/80402m0001.htm#08040249000295">
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/1">Before October 1998 there were no checks in the system to prevent the sale of school playing fields. Local authorities could sell school playing fields and use the proceeds for whatever purpose they saw fit.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/2">Since 1998, under section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, all local authorities and maintained schools in England have needed the consent of the Secretary of State before they can dispose of a school playing field or any part of a school playing field.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/3">Published guidance sets out the criteria for giving consent and makes it clear that a disposal will only be allowed if the sports and curriculum needs of schools and their neighbouring schools continue to be met. Community usage of school playing fields is considered in decisions and any sale proceeds must be re-invested in outdoor sports facilities where possible, or, if not, in indoor sport or education facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/4">In addition, since July 2001 all applications to dispose of school playing fields have been scrutinised by an independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel. The Panel comprises representatives from Fields in Trust (formerly the National Playing Fields Association), the Central Council of Physical Recreation, Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/5">The Panel advises the Secretary of State on the extent to which applications meet the published criteria for giving consent. The Panel brings a rigorous independent scrutiny to the assessment process.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/6">In November 2004 the rules governing the sale of school playing fields were tightened so that the sale of a playing field is an absolute last resort with local authorities having to demonstrate that they have exhausted all other sources of funding. Sale proceeds must be used to improve outdoor sports facilities where possible and new sports facilities must be sustainable for at least 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/7">This Government has not committed itself to end the sale of surplus school playing fields in any circumstances. What we did commit to end was the previous position of putting local authorities in a position where they had to sell those fields simply to pay for essential repairs. Our record levels of capital investment in schools - from under &pound;700 million in 1996-97 to over &pound;8 billion by 2011 - have also helped bring that situation to an end. 1,100 completely newly rebuilt schools have already been built - with brand new sports facilities and outdoor play areas. Another 2,450 schools have made massive improvements to sports provision, with newly built sports halls, all- weather pitches, gyms, playgrounds or changing rooms.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/8">This Government legislated to ensure that school playing fields are sold only where they are genuinely surplus to local needs, including those of neighbouring schools. This Government has ensured that the proceeds of sales are invested mainly in providing new sports facilities, including new grassed pitches, all-weather pitches and sports halls. Where no sports improvements are needed the money from sales must be used to improve educational facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.52WS.1/9">The attached table shows details of the 19 applications which were approved on this basis in 2007.</p>
