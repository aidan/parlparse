	<p pid="b.84WS.4/1">The House will be aware from recent Adjournment debates that military flying activity is essential if we are to maintain operational capability. However, we also take our commitment to minimise, as far is reasonably practicable, the impact of noise on local communities. We have therefore conducted a study on aircraft environmental noise. The report is today being placed in the Library of the House and is published on the Ministry of Defence website at:</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-20b.92WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health" colnum="92WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/wmstext/50720m04.htm#50720m04.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.92WS.1/1">In the White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&quot; we announced the introduction of health trainers, a new type of personal health support in the public health workforce. From 2006 national health service accredited health trainers will be giving support to people who want it in areas of highest need.</p>
	<p pid="b.92WS.1/2">Many people have difficulty in changing to a healthier way of life. There is a great deal of advice and information available and exhortations to change often from distant national bodies and others, but equally often with little recognition of the realities of everyday life. There is support but it is patchy, fragmented and does not fit with their lives. It may be available at the wrong time of day or only accessible to people who speak and read English well, and access is unequal and erratic. Health trainers are designed to address these problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.92WS.1/3">Heath trainers will be visible and accessible to local people through living and working in the communities they serve providing &quot;support from next door&quot;. They will engage local people where they are to be found, for example, mothers at the children's centre, customers at the local pharmacy, members of the tenants' association. Their task is to motivate individuals to set personal goals for improving their health, by developing personal health plans using a core set of skills based on health psychology and a good understanding of what works. They will support people to carry out their plans, for example, accompanying a woman to a breast screening appointment; encouraging a teenage mother to go to the children's centre by arranging to meet her; planning a walking route with a 50 year old man. They will identify barriers with individuals to healthier choices and help find individual solutions by listening, empathising and sharing experiences. They will be able to &quot;signpost&quot; people to local services that can support their healthier choices, through their detailed knowledge of the local area. Health trainers may refer individuals on, but will also encourage, motivate and support them to use what is available, for example information about the local smoking cessation service, and then go with them to the first session.</p>
	<p pid="b.92WS.1/4">In February the Government published the cash allocations for the NHS for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 including additional cash to help to fund &quot;Choosing Health&quot; initiatives such as school nurses, community matrons and health trainers.</p>
	<p pid="b.92WS.1/5">Those in greatest need were also allocated more money. In November, the Government announced the creation of 88 spearhead primary care trusts, which are those most in urgent need of action to tackle health deprivation and reduce inequalities in life expectancy and infant mortality. These areas have received a higher level of funding than other areas, making the allocation much fairer.</p>
	<p pid="b.92WS.1/6">Primary care trusts and their partners, especially the spearhead primary care trusts, are planning to recruit, train, and fund health trainers from April 2006 when this funding comes on stream. In preparation for that I am announcing today 12 early adopter partnerships in 2005&ndash;06, led by the NHS, to develop and test elements of the recruitment. training and employment package and local models of service provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.92WS.1/7">From September, these early adopters will begin to trial a draft set of core competencies and job descriptions prepared by my department and the sector skills council &quot;Skills for Health&quot;. The early adopters will identify suitable local people who, for the most part are already carrying out roles with some similarity to health trainers, assess them against the competencies, provide training to address gaps and then deploy them in local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.92WS.1/8">During 2005&ndash;06 we will be providing all early adopters with additional funding to support them in this work and other primary care trusts with funding support totalling &pound;5 million. Every primary care trust which expressed an interest in being an early adopter will receive &pound;25,000 and the early adopters themselves up to &pound;200,000. The early adopters have been selected following expressions of interest from over 130 primary care trusts and their local partners. These are shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="b.101WS.3/1">Plans to upgrade the A303 trunk road passing Stonehenge and to improve the setting of this outstanding World Heritage Site have a long history. In July 1998, after extensive assessment of alternative options, the Government announced the inclusion in the targeted programme of trunk road improvements of the A303 Stonehenge improvement as an &quot;exceptional environmental scheme&quot;. Following further studies and consultations, a preferred route was announced in June 1999 for improvements to 12.4 km of the A303 running from the countess roundabout in the east to Berwick Downs in the West. The scheme provided for dualling of the route and included a bypass of the village of Winterbourne Stoke and a 2km cut-and-cover tunnel past Stonehenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/2">Following further consultations with English Heritage and the National Trust, a number of alternative tunnel options were evaluated and on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-10">10 December 2002</phrase> the Government announced that they would proceed with further consideration of a 2.1 km tunnel (extending the tunnel by 100 metres compared with the preferred route announcement) and that the tunnel would be bored rather than cut-and-cover, thereby providing significant additional environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/3">The public inquiry into this proposed scheme was held between <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-17">17 February</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-11">11 May 2004</phrase>. The inspector's report was received in January 2005 and the Government have been considering it carefully. The inspector, having considered all the representations and submissions from objectors, was satisfied that the case for the scheme had been made and has recommended that the scheme orders should be made, subject to a number of minor modifications. In particular, he was satisfied with:</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/4" class="indent">the line of the published scheme;</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/5" class="indent">all the proposed slip and side road changes required to implement the scheme;</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/6" class="indent">the requirements of the traffic prohibition orders restricting certain classes of traffic from using the tunnel and some of the new roads; and</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/7" class="indent">the acquisition of all the land and interests necessary to carry out the published scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/8">However, there has been a material change in the estimated scheme costs since the scheme went to public inquiry and which was not part of the inspector's considerations. The Highways Agency's evidence to the public inquiry indicated that the construction cost of the scheme would be &pound;192 million. After allowing for additional factors including land, preparation and supervision costs this translates into a total outturn scheme cost of &pound;284 million, assuming a construction start date of spring 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/9">In addition, following the completion of the public inquiry, the Highways Agency has carried out further detailed assessments of the ground conditions through which the tunnel would be bored. These have confirmed the scale of two significant factors along the line of the proposed tunnel:</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/10" class="indent">very large quantities of phosphatic (soft, weak) chalk;</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/11" class="indent">a high water table, with the groundwater potentially rising to the surface at times of heavy rainfall where the tunnel passes below a shallow valley to the south of Stonehenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/12">These factors would significantly complicate the tunnelling process and extend the overall construction period of the scheme. Together with certain other factors which serve to increase tunnel costs, including more rapid increases in construction cost inflation than had previously been anticipated, the Highways Agency's latest estimate of the outturn cost of the scheme has now risen to some &pound;470 million. For consistency with earlier estimates, this figure also assumes a construction start date of spring 2005. Slippage in the start date beyond spring 2005 will have further increased the estimated cost in line with continuing inflation in construction costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/13">This represents a significant change to the basis on which the Government originally decided to progress this scheme. Our recognition of the importance of Stonehenge as a World Heritage Site remains unchanged but given the scale of the cost increase we have to re-examine whether the scheme still represents value for money and the best option for delivering improvements to the A303 and the setting of Stonehenge. The Government therefore plan to carry out a detailed review of the options, consulting relevant environmental interests including, in particular, English Heritage and the National Trust, before taking a final decision on the inspector's report. The review will also consider the implications of delaying the Stonehenge scheme for the delivery of improvements proposed for other single carriageway sections of the A303 further to the west.</p>
	<p pid="b.101WS.3/14">I have placed copies of the inspector's report in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.103WS.4/1">This quarterly report is to update the House on progress of the Child Support Agency. It covers the period from March to June 2005 and contains improved management information. The last report formed part of the Government's response to the Work and Pensions Select Committee's Second Report of the Session 2004&ndash;05 and covered performance up to February 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/2">The Agency is currently administering cases under new and old schemes, across two computer systems. At the end of June 2005, the Agency's caseload stood at around 1.4 million cases. Of these, 950,000 cases were being administered under the old child support scheme (270,000 of which were on the new computer system having migrated from the old computer system because they were linked in some way to a new application) and 480,000 were being administered under the new scheme. Around 12,000 new scheme cases are being administered clerically as they are un-progressable on the new computer system.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/3">Since the inception of the new scheme in March 2003 the Agency has received 680,000 potential new scheme applications, of which 420,000 have been cleared. The remaining 260,000 are at various stages of the work in progress, representing a marginal reduction since March as a result of efforts by the Agency to focus on its backlogs. In addition, there are 78,000 old scheme cases awaiting an assessment, a reduction from 130,000 in June 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/4">In June 2005, as a result of the Agency's intervention, 390,000 parents with care (equating to 520,000 children) were in receipt of maintenance via the collection service, or had a maintenance direct arrangement in place. Despite the problems with the administration of the new scheme the proportion of parents with a new scheme calculation who receive maintenance is higher (54 per cent.) than if they had been assessed under the old scheme (46 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/5">During the period March 2005 to June 2005 overall Agency case compliance remained stable at 70 per cent. This is also the case for old scheme compliance at 72 per cent. New scheme compliance, at 66 per cent. in June 2005, has risen from 61 per cent. in June 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/6">As a result of initiatives rolled out since autumn 2004, we are seeing real improvement in case compliance for those cases for which maintenance was calculated from September 2004 onwards. The overall new scheme compliance rate was 66 per cent in June 2005, and, for those new cases calculated in February 2005 (the latest month for which compliance has begun to stabilise for new cases), compliance had reached 78 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/7">Trends in cash compliance performance are broadly flat over the period, with overall Agency performance at 69 per cent. in June 2005. Old and new scheme performance was 72 per cent and 62 per cent respectively with new scheme performance having improved from 50 per cent in June 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/8">During the quarter ending June 2005 the Agency collected maintenance arrears equivalent to 35 per cent of the total amount of unpaid regular maintenance which accrued over the same period. Performance across the quarter has remained unchanged for the old scheme at 40 per cent, with new scheme performance demonstrating further improvement from 22 per cent to 27 per cent (having already risen from 15 per cent in June 2004).</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/9">Accuracy performance is measured cumulatively month-on-month throughout the year. Figures based on the first results of 2005&ndash;06 show performance to June of 82 per cent for new scheme and 75 per cent for old scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/10">Whilst we have seen continuing progress some significant problems remain with the new computer and telephony systems and these continue to slow progress on business recovery. The Agency is working closely with EDS to resolve these problems and further IT releases were successfully implemented in December 2004 and May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/11">We have always said that no decision will be taken on when to convert old scheme cases until we are confident the new scheme is working well. A new chief executive was appointed in April this year and he has initiated a strategic review of the Agency's objectives and operational arrangements. He will report to Ministers in the coming months and we will report to the House in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.103WS.4/31" class="indent">3. Figures exclude cases which have been progressed and cleared clerically. This is because it is not possible to determine how many clerically progressed cases are still included in the Agency's work in progress, or were originally included in the intake figures. Details of clerically progressed cases are included below:</p>

	<p pid="b.103WS.4/66">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/67">1. Compliance is measured over a quarterly period as opposed to monthly, as it is a less volatile measure of performance in that it smoothes out the impact of events such as bank holidays, late payments and processing details. These figures may be subject to change as more reliable information becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="b.103WS.4/68">2. There are no figures for new scheme for June 2004 or for new and old scheme in April 2005 because no accuracy checks were performed during that month. Accuracy across old scheme cases on both systems has been recorded only since May 2005. Prior to May 2005, accuracy was measured only against those old scheme cases on the old computer system.</p>
