<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-19a.1WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="1WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091119/wmstext/91119m0001.htm#09111944000354">
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/1">The Government are correcting an omission in section 214B of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), inserted by section 171 of the Banking Act 2009, relating to the calculation of the contribution of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) to Special Resolution Regime (SRR) costs. The necessary amendments are included in the Financial Services Bill but new regulations made under the revised power will have retrospective effect so they will take effect from today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/2">In the event of a bank or building society (&quot;an institution's&quot;) insolvency the FSCS provides statutory compensation to eligible depositors, up to a prescribed limit currently set (in rules made by the Financial Services Authority (FSA)) at &pound;50,000. On paying the compensation, the FSCS takes over the depositors' claims against the estate of the insolvent institution. The FSCS is funded by levies on industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/3">The SRR, established by part 1 of the Banking Act 2009, enables the authorities to resolve a failing institution, rather than allowing it to become insolvent. Under regulations made under section 214B FSMA, the FSCS may be required to contribute to the costs of the SRR, up to the net cost that the FSCS would have had to incur in a counterfactual scenario where the institution had instead gone into insolvency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/4">The change will mean that the Government can include the interest costs incurred in a resolution in the calculation of costs to which the FSCS may be required to contribute. It will also mean that the maximum contribution the FSCS can be required to make will include interest costs which the FSCS would have borne in the hypothetical scenario where the institution had gone into insolvency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/5">This will be achieved through the keeping of two separate accounts which record all costs (including interest), recoveries, and any interim contributions to SRR costs which the FSCS is required to make. The interest will be calculated by applying interest rates prescribed by the Treasury to the net balance in the relevant account at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/6">First, a real account will be kept which records all actual resolution outlays the authorities incur and all associated inflows (that is, the proceeds of the disposal of the assets of the failed institution and any interim contributions to SRR costs). Interest will be calculated periodically (on the net balance on the account) and added to the outlays.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/7">Secondly, a hypothetical account will be kept based on the counterfactual scenario using data from the FSCS as to how much compensation would have been paid and when. Interest will be added to reflect the cost of the borrowing the FSCS would have needed to fund compensation payments. The timed recoveries that would have been received from the insolvent estate are to be determined by an independent valuer and will be included in the account and will reduce the balance on which interest is calculated. Any interim contributions the FSCS is required to make to the SRR and any compensation the FSCS has actually paid to depositors will also be included to reduce the balance on which interest is calculated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/8">When all recoveries have been made the real account will show the net cost of the resolution including interest incurred by that date; the hypothetical account will show the net cost of compensating depositors were the institution allowed to fail, including interest up to that date. After independent verification, the FSCS may be required to contribute up to the lower of the two accounts. Payment may be requested before all recoveries have been made based on an estimate of the payment required which, if included in the lower of the two accounts, would bring the balance when all recoveries have been made to zero. If, after all recoveries had been made, this turned out to be too large a contribution, the Treasury would make a balancing payment to the FSCS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/9">Since this power is to have retrospective effect from today, this interest cost will be included in the two accounts kept in relation to Dunfermline Building Society from the date of this announcement. As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase> the FSCS will be required to pay a contribution to resolution costs at the end of the Dunfermline Building Society resolution; no interim contributions to SRR costs will be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.4/10">The interest rate to be used on the two accounts in relation to Dunfermline Building Society is 4.50 per cent. This rate reflects the rate of interest the FSCS would have had to pay were the institution to become insolvent and funds were borrowed in order to make compensation payments to depositors, with recoveries made over an estimated five-year period.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-19a.7WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="7WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091119/wmstext/91119m0002.htm#09111944000358">
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/1">I would like to inform the House that today I have introduced to Parliament a revised Flood and Water Management Bill, laid regulations under the European Communities Act to implement the EU floods directive and published a command paper setting out the Government's response to pre-legislative scrutiny and consultation on the draft Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/2">The floods in 2007 claimed 13 lives and cost our economy &pound;3 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/3">Sir Michael Pitt undertook a comprehensive review of the lessons to be learned from the floods. He called for urgent and fundamental changes in the way the country is adapting to the increased risk of flooding. To ensure that the 5 million people living in flood risk areas around the country are better protected we are also investing more than ever in maintaining traditional flood defences-&pound;2.15 billion in the current spending round.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/4">Since the 2007 floods the Environment Agency has completed and maintained 102 flood defence schemes, protecting over 63,000 additional homes in England. Operating authorities are currently on course to exceed delivery targets and provide better protection to 160,000 homes over the three years to March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/5">In this time, Government have also, among other measures, provided &pound;15 million funding to local authorities to help them manage local flood risk, and set up a flood forecasting centre that will improve the way we predict potential flooding and the exchange of information between emergency services.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/6">We also promised legislation as a central part of this programme of action.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/7">In April this year, the UK Government and Welsh Assembly Government published the draft Flood and Water Management Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny and public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/8">The public consultation on the draft Bill in England and Wales generated over 650 responses. A summary of the responses is also being published today on the DEFRA website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/flooding/policy/fwmb/">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/flooding/policy/fwmb/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/9">The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) Select Committee published its report on its pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-23">23 September</phrase>. The Department is grateful to the Committee, and to those who gave evidence, for their vigour and commitment in developing the report. The Government have considered it very carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/10">We believe the consultation responses indicate broad support for our overarching proposals. Both they and the EFRA Select Committee's report gave valuable and useful feedback that has informed the way forward, which is now set out in the command paper published today. That command paper sets out the Department's response to each of the recommendations made by the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/11">In line with one of the Committee's recommendations I have also today arranged for copies of a statement from Ofwat to be placed in the House Library. This statement sets out Ofwat's assessment of the risks to water industry investors of the Bill's proposed changes to the regulatory regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/12">Some have argued that it is preferable to wait until it is possible to bring forward a single Bill which makes all the necessary changes to both flood and water legislation and brings them together with the current statute book. However, the Government are clear that it should legislate as soon as possible for the new clear roles and powers necessary to improve the protection of people from the risk of floods.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/13">The Bill also meets our commitment to safeguard community groups, such as churches and scouts, from the unaffordable increases in surface water drainage charges they face now.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/14">Furthermore, the EU floods directive is due to be transposed this month. This has led us to lay regulations now, to avoid unreasonable delays and the increased risks of infraction.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/15">Climate projections suggest that extreme weather will happen more frequently in future. Members will be aware of the many flood warnings issued this week and the work being carried out at this moment by the Environment Agency, local authorities, emergency services and the voluntary sector to help protect homes, businesses and people against the risk of flooding. Our thanks go to those many people and organisations on the front-line, tackling flooding, and our thoughts are with those directly affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.7WS.4/16">Serious flooding can happen any time. This Bill is central to reducing that risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.10WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-29">29 October</phrase>, I reported progress to Parliament on the progress achieved further to my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Bradley's review of people with mental health problems or learning disabilities in the criminal justice system. The Government accepted the direction of travel set out by Lord Bradley, and committed to developing a national delivery plan incorporating a full response to the report's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.1/2">I am pleased to report that &quot;Improving Health, Supporting Justice&quot;, the Government's national delivery plan was published and launched at a cross-departmental health and criminal justice conference in York on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-17">Tuesday 17 November</phrase>. This delivery plan will contribute to key Government initiatives around protecting the public, reducing health inequalities, reducing reoffending and health improvement and protection. In particular, it aims to:</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.1/3" class="indent">provide a strategic framework within which local services can deliver quality improvements, and to communicate the framework to the relevant NHS and criminal justice organisations;</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.1/4" class="indent">set out the actions the Government will take to support these improvements; and</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.1/5" class="indent">develop a national approach, by building on the good work and good practice that is already underway in individual localities and maintain the significant impetus and enthusiasm created by Lord Bradley's report, to drive forward improvements in health and social care services for offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.10WS.1/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-29">29 October</phrase>, I also reported that Keith Pearson (chair of NHS East of England), has been appointed as the chair of the health and criminal justice national advisory group.

	<p pid="a.11WS.4/1">The informal G6 group of Interior Ministers from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland and the UK held their most recent meeting in London on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-05">5 November</phrase>. The UK currently holds the presidency of the G6 group and the meeting was chaired by the Home Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.4/2">The meeting was divided into three working sessions, the first two of which were attended by the core G6 Ministers. This group sat again for the final working session, with the additional guest attendance of the United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.4/3">The first working session considered the issue of organised crime, where the Home Secretary presented the results of the UK's recent domestic review: &quot;Extending Our Reach: A Comprehensive Approach to Tackling Serious Organised Crime&quot;, published in July, and asked what more the G6 countries could do together to tackle the threats posed. The group exchanged experiences of what had been found to work in each country in tackling organised crime. There was broad agreement to the need for organised crime to be raised up the agenda. Ministers recognised the value of working together to tackle organised crime, and agreed to more sharing of best practice where relevant.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.4/4">During the second session the Ministers considered what benefits data sharing could bring to strengthen borders, improve identity management and facilitate the prevention and detection of serious organised crime but also the challenges faced to ensure data was secure and protected. There was less of a consensus on this issue due to the incompatibility between legal systems in each state.</p>
	<p pid="a.11WS.4/5">The afternoon session opened with a presentation by the UK of the current terrorist threat assessment. Ministers offered information on the threats posed in their respective countries. This was followed by a discussion of how to counter radicalisation through community engagement, which focused mainly on the role of Mosques in radicalisation of young people. Conversation centred on difficulties of Mosques preaching in a non EU language (for early stage interventions), and considerations of how to better regulate Imams.</p>

	<p pid="a.15WS.2/1">The legislative programme for the fifth Session was outlined on the <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-18">18 November</phrase>. Eight of the 10 new Bills outlined in the Queen's Speech in this final Session of the current Parliament contain provisions that apply to Scotland; once again this is a programme that will significantly benefit people living in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/2">In this Session the Government will focus on supporting the economy as we move from recession to recovery and we will take forward measures to support people living and working in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/3">This statement provides a summary of the legislation announced in the Queen's Speech and its application to Scotland. This statement includes both new Bills that will be introduced shortly, and those Bills that are carrying-over from the last Session. It does not include draft Bills. The Bills listed in section 1 are likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament in line with the Sewel convention. A brief description is provided of the provisions likely to require consent. Section 2 details Bills that are not likely to contain provisions that require the consent of the Scottish Parliament, by way of a Legislative Consent Motion (LCM).</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/4">The list also identifies the lead Government Department:</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/5" class="italic">1. <i>UK Legislation likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament at introduction</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/6">Discussions will continue between the Government and Scottish Ministers on Bills that might include provisions that trigger the Sewel convention. The Bills identified within the Queen's Speech in this section are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/7"><i>Bribery (MoJ)</i>-This Bill primarily relates to criminal law which is a devolved matter in Scotland. Following a consultation exercise in Scotland, Scottish Ministers have agreed that the best way to reform the law on bribery in Scotland is via an LCM extending full provisions of this Bill to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/8"><i>Child Poverty Bill (HMT) (introduced in the 4th Session</i><i>)</i>-This Bill enshrines in law the Government's commitment to end child poverty by 2020. Four indicators of child poverty are identified by this Bill. An LCM is required in order to extend the commitment to those matters that are within the competence of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/9"><i>Constitutional Reform and Governance (MoJ) (introduced in the 4th Session)</i>-The majority of the provisions in the Bill extend to Scotland and Bill aims to rebuild trust in our democratic and constitutional settlement by reinforcing the principles of transparency, accountability and probity across Government. An LCM is required for provisions concerning requirements placed upon the Scottish Ministers in relation to the civil service and special advisors. An LCM is also required for the amendments concerning time-limits for human rights claims under the Human Rights and Devolution Acts.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/10"><i>Crime and Security (Home Office)</i>-The majority of this Bill will not apply to Scotland, however provisions that give Scottish Ministers new powers to regulate the private security industry will require a LCM.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/11"><i>Energy Bill (DECC)</i>-This Bill will commit the Government to developing the use of clean coal and help vulnerable households with their energy Bills. It will require an LCM for the provisions that relate to funding for up to four commercial-scale carbon capture and storage demonstration projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/12"><i>Equality Bill (GEO) (introduced in 4th Session)</i><i>-</i> Equal opportunities is a reserved matter. This Bill requires an LCM as it will amend the Scottish Ministers functions by allowing them to impose specific public sector duties on the Scottish public bodies for the three new strands.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/13"><i>Financial Services Bill (HMT)</i>-The Bill will strengthen governance of the financial sector, control the system of rewards and ensure savers and lenders are fully protected. An LCM will be required for provisions relating to consumer education.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/14"><i>Flood and Water Management (DEFRA)</i>-The Bill generally applies to England and Wales only but an LCM will be required for provisions relating to cross-border reservoir safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/15" class="italic">2. <i>UK Legislation unlikely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the</i><i>Scottish Parliament at</i> introduction:</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/16">Discussions will continue between the Government and Scottish Ministers to ensure that, if provisions relating to matters which trigger the Sewel convention are included in any of these Bills during their passage at Westminster, the consent of the Scottish Parliament will be sought for them in line with the Sewel convention:</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/17" class="indent">Personal Care at Home Bill (DoH)</p>
	<p pid="a.15WS.2/18" class="indent">Children, Schools and Families Bill (DCSF)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-19a.17WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1653" speakername="Chris Mole" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="17WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091119/wmstext/91119m0003.htm#09111944000370">
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/1">My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis, has made the following ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/2" class="indent">In May 2009 I invited Sir Peter Hall, Professor of Planning at University College London, and Chris Green, formerly Chief Executive of Virgin Trains, to advise on ways to improve railway stations in England and Wales, focusing on getting the basic facilities right as well as considering the broader role of stations in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/3" class="indent">Their report, which I have published, focuses on:</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/4" class="indent">achieving an enhanced and consistent level of facilities at each type of station, so that passengers can find what they need and know what to expect;</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/5" class="indent">a greater emphasis on end-to-end journeys, with more attention given to helping passengers get to and from the station by bus, bike or car; and</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/6" class="indent">more effective integration of public transport into the planning of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/7" class="indent">These are all vital to the creation of a modern transport system that promotes individual choice and supports the national economy. The report complements existing Government initiatives, such as the &pound;14 million which I recently announced to improve the provision for cyclists at stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/8" class="indent">The champions have found that the largest stations, including the main termini, are generally up to the standards that passengers should expect. But there are stations in the next tier-the major interchanges-which fall below the required standard and are in urgent need of attention. The Government and Network Rail are committed to a rolling programme of improvements to major stations, and I have agreed with Network Rail that they will make up to &pound;50 million available to enable an early start to be made on the 10 key stations highlighted in the report. My Department will be working closely with Network Rail to decide on a programme of work, funded by them, developer and local contributions and through the franchising process. The investment will of course be subject to a satisfactory business case and the prospect of an adequate financial return. I am challenging the industry and local government to raise part of the money required for each of these stations themselves. It is very important that the additional programme funding that I am announcing should be supplemented in this way so that as many stations as possible can be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/9" class="indent">It will be helpful and constructive to give organisations in the industry, the devolved Administrations and local government an opportunity to comment on the many very detailed proposals in the report before we decide how to take them forward. I want to be sure that when we implement the report we give priority to the most urgent actions and get the best possible value for the taxpayer's investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/10" class="indent">I am placing copies of the champions' report, the Government's initial response and the consultation I have launched in the Libraries of both Houses. The text of these documents is also being posted on my Department's website.</p>
