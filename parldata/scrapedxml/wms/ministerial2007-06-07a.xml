<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-06-07a.29WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" speakeroffice="The Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning" colnum="29WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070607/wmstext/70607m0001.htm#07060782000080">
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/1">I attended the Education Council on behalf on the UK; Anne Lambert (Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU) attended the Youth Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/2">Ministers discussed the following issues:</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/3" class="italic">Education</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/4">Conclusions on a coherent framework of indicators and benchmarks for monitoring progress towards the Lisbon objectives in education and training</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/5" class="indent">1. The Council adopted the conclusions without comment. The Commission presented its plans to develop a European Indicator of Language Competence. I intervened on this point to object to carrying out the new survey in 2009, as this will clash with other school surveys that are taking place that year. This view was supported by many member states and the Commission agreed to put back the languages survey to 2010. Ministers also agreed that all official EU languages would be tested in subsequent surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/6">Evidence-based policy-making in the field of education</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/7" class="indent">2. Ministers had an exchange of views on this issue, looking at ways to further develop and use educational research, and how such action can be supported at EU level. It was agreed that educational strategies needed to be based on empirical evidence; that research had to be linked closely to practice on the ground; and that close contact was needed between researchers, practitioners and politicians. I emphasised the importance of making best use of existing research and focusing on topics that informed practice on the ground. I also said that peer learning and peer review should be strengthened at European level particularly in relation to skills development. This would help to disseminate effective policies and contribute to implementing the Lisbon process. Others drew attention to the role of the OECD in producing valuable data and informing policy making at national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/8" class="italic">Youth</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/9">Resolution on creating equal opportunities for all young people</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/10" class="indent">3. The Council approved the Resolution without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/11">Conclusions on future perspectives for European cooperation in the field of youth policy</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/12" class="indent">4. Member states agreed to adopt the Conclusions. An exchange of views showed considerable consensus around the UK's position of a cross-sectoral approach to youth policy, with a role for this Council of looking at youth-specific aspects of policy and feeding it in to other Council formations such as Employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/13" class="indent">5. The UK said that it believed that youth policy was best formulated at local level but there was an important role for exchange of good practice. On peer learning and exchange of good practice we could look at making better use of existing tools but also at the experience of undertaking these activities in education and adapting it to the youth field.</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/14" class="italic">AOB</p>
	<p pid="a.29WS.2/15" class="indent">6. The Presidency reported that the European Parliament's opinion on the European Qualifications Framework was expected between July and September. Austria informed the Council of its concerns about an ECJ ruling relating to an Austrian University regarding non-discriminatory access to higher education. They were supported by Luxembourg and Denmark. Portugal said it would address this issue duringits Presidency. Finally, Portugal gave an encouraging presentation of its Presidency priorities. They aim to strengthen the education and skills aspects of the Lisbon agenda and to give priority to higher education.</p>
