	<p pid=".6WS.1/45">The above calculation involves estimating several figures that are inherently difficult to forecast accurately, such as the gross rate yield and the prior year adjustments. The resulting figure of &pound;15.014 billion has therefore been rounded to &pound;15 billion exactly to avoid spurious accuracy.<i>Notes:</i></p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/46">For 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 the amounts shown are those recorded in the outturn (NNDR3) returns. For 2003&ndash;04 the amounts shown are the provisional outturn for the year based mainly upon authorities' provisional contributions to the non-domestic rating pool. For 2004&ndash;05 the estimates are based on:</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/47">1. Item 1: The gross calculated rate yield represents the total value of non-domestic hereditaments on local rating lists <i>adjusted in relation to previous years outturn information regarding the gross rate yield</i> times the multiplier.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/48">2. Item 1(i)(a): The transitional decrease adjustment includes the estimated amount of rates that will not be recouped from local list ratepayers under the transitional arrangements made by regulations under section 58 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and the transitional relief scheme, announced by written PQ on <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-25">25 November 1999</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/1999-11-25.770"><i>Official Report</i>, column 770W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/49">3. Item 1(i)(b): The empty property relief adjustments include voids and partially occupied hereditaments. The 2004&ndash;05 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/50">4. Item 1(i)(c): Charitable rate relief. The 2004&ndash;05 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/51">5. Item 1(i)(d): Rural Shops and Post Office relief. Figures include mandatory relief for general stores and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997. Figures for 2001&ndash;02 onwards includes mandatory relief for petrol filing stations and public houses under the Non-Domestic Rating (Public Houses and Petrol Filling Stations) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001/1345) and mandatory relief for new enterprises on former agricultural premises under the Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001. The 2004&ndash;05 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/52">6. Item 1(i)(e): Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs). Mandatory rate relief for sports clubs registered with the Inland Revenue as Community Amateur Sports Clubs under the Section 64 of the Local Government Act 2003. This provision comes into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. Sports Clubs that have not registered will still be eligible for discretionary relief allowed to non-profit making bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/53">7. Item 1(i)(f): Discretionary relief granted to charities, non-profit making organisations and for other reasons including discretionary relief for village shops and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997. Figures for 2001&ndash;02 onwards include discretionary relief for petrol filing stations and public houses under the Non-Domestic Rating (Public Houses and Petrol Filling Stations) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001/1345) and discretionary relief for new enterprises on former agricultural premises under the Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001. The 2004&ndash;05 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/54">8. Item 1(ii)(a) and (b): The allowances for the costs and losses incurred by authorities in collecting non-domestic rates from ratepayers.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/55">9. Item 1(ii)(c): City Offset&mdash;the amount which the City of London will not be required to pay into the non-domestic rating pool. It is the amount which will be retained by the City to meet its own expenditure. <i>In 2004&ndash;05, City offset is to be set to zero.</i></p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/56">10. Item l(iii): net adjustment in respect of appeals and other amendments to the rating list affecting liability for previous years rates settled in that year: comprising repayments and associated interest payments.</p>

	<p pid=".6WS.1/58">12. Item 3: Almost all properties previously included in the Crown List are included in the local list figures at item 1.</p>
	<p pid=".6WS.1/59">13.

	Town and Country Planning (Use Classes Order)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-11-27.9WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" speakername="Keith Hill" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning" colnum="9WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo031127/wmstext/31127m02.htm#31127m02.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".9WS.1/1">In January 2002, the Government issued a consultation document on possible changes to the Town and Country Planning Use Classes Order. Responses were to be received by <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-24">24 April 2002</phrase>. We received over 2000 responses, which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has since been considering.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/2">'A' Use Class</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/3">The consultation document proposed amalgamating the A1 and A2 Use Classes. This would have resulted in a broad Use Class, comprising of shops and premises in the financial and professional services sector. However, response from a range of sectors in the marketplace expressed anxiety and further research suggested that this proposal may not prove beneficial for business growth and would on the whole do more harm than good. As a consequence, the Government will not be taking this proposal forward, the A1 and A2 Use Classes will remain separate.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/4">However, the Government will be making a number of amendments to the A1 Use Class to bring it up to date and ensure that it reflects Government policy on town centres. These are:</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/5" class="indent">Internet cafes will be classified as an A1 use;</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/6" class="indent">Warehouse clubs will be taken out of the Use Classes Order, thus becoming <i>sui generis;</i></p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/7" class="indent">Motor vehicle showrooms will no longer enjoy permitted development rights for a change-of-use to any A1 use.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/8">There will be no other changes to the A1 or A2 Use Classes.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/9">The current A3 Use Class includes cafes, restaurants, pubs, bars, and takeaways. The consultation revealed that there is widespread concern that such a broad classification, which allows change of use from restaurants to pubs without the need for planning permission, contributes to the increase in the number of licensed premises. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-04">4 March</phrase> this year, the hon. Member for Harrow East, Mr McNulty made a statement to the House announcing the Government had considered these representations carefully and proposed to put pubs and bars into a separate class.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/10">Although restaurants and cafes will retain their A3 classification, this class will be modified to omit the reference to the sale of hot food for consumption off the premises. Class A3 will therefore be restricted to restaurant or cafe type uses. A change of use to Al or A2 Use Classes will be permitted but all other changes of use will require planning permission. Pubs and bars will be classified under a new Use Class A4.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/11">Takeaways will be classified under a new Use Class A5 due to the high level of concern expressed during the consultation about the specific impacts on amenity caused by such businesses and their customers. Both A4 and A5 Use Classes will be permitted a change of use to A1, A2 or A3 classification. Any other proposed changes of use will require planning permission.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/12">We do not propose to make any amendments to the current B Use Classes.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/13">Neither do we propose to make changes to the current C Use Classes.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/14">We propose to make one change to the current D Use Class, an additional Use Class D3: Late Night Leisure. Most existing late night uses are already covered by existing classes, however nightclubs do not have a clear classification within the current Use Classes Order, and the impact on amenity of nightclubs is distinct and different from other uses. We will, therefore introduce a new Use Class D3 will be the classification for nightclubs. Planning permission will be required for any change of use from or to a D3 classification.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/15">A statutory instrument giving effect to these changes will be made in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.1/16">The order will be made under section 55(2)(f) of the Town &amp; Country Planning Act 1990 and it is therefore not subject to the Parliamentary procedures set out in section 333 of the Act.</p>

	<p pid=".18WS.1/1">The Government remains committed to the sale of the Tote, and we plan to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals very shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.1/2">As part of the preparations for the sale, the Government has had to consider whether the Tote's current exclusive right to offer pool betting on British horseracing should continue once it has been transferred into the private sector. We have concluded that it will be in the public interest to open up the pool betting market to effective competition, but that a reasonable preparatory period is necessary in order to safeguard the policy aims underlying the sale.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.1/3">The Government has therefore decided that if our plans to sell the Tote to a racing consortium proceed, then the current intention is to issue the Tote's successor company with an exclusive licence to operate horserace pool betting on British racing for seven years.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.1/4">This licence will not be extended and at the end of that period there will be a new regulatory regime that will allow other operators to provide pool betting as well. We believe that this proposal provides necessary certainty for all concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".18WS.4/17">The increase of &pound;200,000 arises from a transfer from the Home Office to support the six-month extension to the Visual Recording of Suspects' pilots and the increase of &pound;24,000 is from the Department of Constitutional Affairs (DCA) for the Case Preparation Project pilots.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.4/18">The Capital Modernisation Fund provided &pound;1,800,000 in 2003&ndash;04 to enable the CPS to develop a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that would support secure e-mail and data transfer with other CJS organisations; and barristers and solicitors in the private sector. During the planning stage, an alternative simpler solution was identified and tested and it is this initiative that will be taken forward by Criminal Justice Information Technology (CJIT). CJIT have indicated that they do not require the funding to be transferred and consequently the decrease in the capital element of the DEL arises from the CPS returning &pound;1,800,000 capital to the Capital Modernisation Fund.</p>

	<p pid=".18WS.4/20">The increase in the resource element of the DEL arises from additional costs relating to two blockbuster fraud cases; &pound;2,240,000 relates to increased administration costs and &pound;3,200,000 relates to programme costs&mdash;mainly investigation and prosecution costs.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.4/21">The change in the capital element of the SFO DEL arises from a &pound;450,000 increase in I.T. hardware spending, which relates to one of the blockbuster cases. These changes in DEL are supported by a claim on the DEL Reserve. This was agreed due to these cases being considered different from normal SFO cases in terms of their size and complexity and because of the strong public interest in pursuing them.</p>
	<p pid=".18WS.4/22">There is no change in the resource element of the DEL for the Treasury Solicitors' Department (TSOL). The increase in capital of &pound;2,050,000 from &pound;3,200,000 to &pound;5,250,000 arises from major areas of capital expenditure relating to the implementation of new systems and the upgrading of the Department's I.T. infrastructure. The new major systems include a practice and case management system, (which enables the Department to more effectively manage and monitor its casework), a new electronic records and electronic document management system and, also, an upgrade to the Department's financial systems.</p>

	<p pid=".29WS.2/1">The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) will reduce the number of sites on which it operates to three core sites: Fort Halstead in Kent, Porton Down in Wiltshire, and Portsdown West, near Portsmouth in Hampshire. Approximately 1400 Dstl staff, who are currently geographically dispersed, from Farnborough in Hampshire, Malvern in Worcestershire, and Winfrith in Dorset, as well as other minor sites, will relocate to the three core sites over the next few years. The programme is likely to be completed in 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.2/2">Among the benefits that will accrue to Dstl and MOD are:</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.2/3" class="indent">increased technical synergy and coherence;</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.2/4" class="indent">improved operational effectiveness;</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.2/5" class="indent">better integration of teams;</p>

	<p pid=".29WS.2/8">MOD has undertaken a regional impact assessment to assess the effect on staff and local communities. This particularly supports the move of staff to Portsmouth, an area of economic deprivation. Of the options open to Dstl, the plans are most consistent with the aims of the review of public sector relocation being undertaken by Sir Michael Lyons on behalf of the Chancellor and Deputy Prime Minister, and have been approved the Treasury.</p>

	<p pid=".29WS.4/1">The Multinational Division (South-East) (MND(SE)) in Iraq was successfully instituted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-13">13 July</phrase> and the UK now leads a 10-nation contingent in the southern Iraqi provinces of Basra, Maysan, Dhi Qar and Al Muthanna.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.4/2">As part of our routine management of the UK's land deployment we intend shortly to conduct a roulement of our forces in theatre. This will begin with an incremental replacement of HQ 3 (UK) Division with a composite headquarters for MND(SE), the staff for which will be drawn from across UK Defence and from allies. 1 Mechanised Brigade will begin to replace 20 Armoured Brigade as the foundation for the UK's military commitment inside Iraq in April 2004. We intend that the process will be complete by the end of April 2004. We expect the level of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force presence in theatre to remain broadly stable.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.4/3">As part of this roulement forces and in line with our policy of employing the reserves as an integral component of the Armed Forces, we shall be mobilising a further tranche of around 1,100 Reservists to support operations in Iraq. We expect these personnel to deploy from mid February 2004 onwards. Although a significant mobilisation, this is both in absolute terms a smaller number than have been mobilised for previous tranches, and will constitute a smaller proportion of the service personnel deployed to theatre than previously. These Reservists will be employed in a number of roles: about a third in theatre at any one time will be deployed in the infantry role as force protection, a little under a quarter will provide reinforcement to regular infantry units deployed, about a sixth will be medical personnel and the remainder will provide a variety of specialist capabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.4/4">We aim to issue the majority of call-out notices around <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-09">9 January 2004</phrase> and begin mobilisation in mid February 2004. Reservist personnel will receive at least 21 days' notice to mobilise. Mobilisation will be followed by a period of individual training to confirm basic skills, theatre specific pre-deployment training, role-specific collective training, integration into receiving units and then a short period of leave before deployment. For the majority of those called-out their deployed tour will last six months; and for most the total period of mobilisation, including post-tour leave, is expected to last between eight and nine months, though for a very small proportion it may be slightly longer.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.4/5">We intend to spend the period between now and January identifying for selection as accurately as possible those Reservists who are believed to be fit and available for deployment. As in previous practice, to ensure that we successfully mobilise the required number, we will need to issue a greater number of call-out notices than our actual in-theatre requirement.</p>
	<p pid=".29WS.4/6">We will continue to keep the size and mix of forces in theatre under careful review and we can expect to make further adjustments to our force structures and undertake further mobilisations in order to ensure that we continue to have the appropriate capabilities for the tasks in hand. While we remain determined to maintain appropriate forces deployed in Iraq and the wider Gulf region for as long as is necessary, we are equally determined that no forces should remain deployed for any longer than is necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".32WS.1/1">The Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA) currently runs a 28 week course for junior soldiers at the Army Technical Foundation College (ATFC) at Rowcroft Barracks, Arborfield. The Course is aimed at recruits to the Royal Engineers (RE), the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME), the Royal Signals (R Signals) and the Royal Logistics Corps (RLC).</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.1/2">Amongst REME recruits especially the quality of output from the College has not been high enough. This has resulted in failure at Phase 2 specialist training by an unacceptably high number of individuals. ATRA has considered a number of ways of addressing this problem and has come to the conclusion that the best solution entails the closure of the College and the transfer of students to, principally, the Army Foundation College (AFC) at Harrogate, where a new technical training stream will be introduced. There will be other changes to the way in which junior recruits are trained within ATRA, but these will not involve closures of any other establishments.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.1/3">No final decision regarding the closure date has yet been taken. I have given approval in principle to this course of action and ATRA is undertaking a full consultation exercise with the relevant Trades Unions. This is expected to take until January 2004, at which time I will consider the outcome, come to a conclusion and advise the House accordingly.</p>

	<p pid=".33WS.2/1">The Government published a consultation paper on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase> setting out the options for implementing the Large Combustion Plants Directive (2001/80/EC) in the UK for plants first licensed before July 1987. For these plants, there is a choice between either setting emission limit values individually for each plant, or establishing a 'national plan' under which a 'bubble' for each of the pollutants covered by the Directive (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust) could be shared between plants in the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/2">Consultations closed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-30">30 September</phrase>. We received a number of detailed submissions on the consultation paper which we have been considering. No consensus has emerged from the responses to the consultation and there are strongly held views in favour of both implementation options. The choice between the options is also sensitive to other policies on which decisions will be taken in the next few months.</p>
	<p pid=".33WS.2/3">The Directive requires that any national plan is submitted to the European Commission by <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-27">27 November 2003</phrase>. However, we consider that further analysis is required before we can be sure which implementation approach it is in the UK interest to adopt. We are therefore submitting a national plan to the Commission at the same time as undertaking this further analysis. This will in effect keep either option open, We would withdraw the plan if this farther analysis suggested that the emission limits approach was to be preferred. A decision on whether to withdraw the national plan would be taken before spring 2004.</p>

	Asylum Legal Aid
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-11-27.34WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1033" speakername="David Lammy" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs" colnum="34WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo031127/wmstext/31127m08.htm#31127m08.html_spmin4">
	<p pid=".34WS.2/1">Asylum legal aid costs have risen from &pound;81.3 million in 2000&ndash;01 to &pound;174.2 million in 2002&ndash;03. There are a number of reasons for this increase, but it remains the case that the majority of claims for asylum are refused. As we set out in our Consultation Paper of <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-05">5 June 2003</phrase>, this increase in costs, coupled with concerns about the quality of some work undertaken under legal aid, and evidence of duplication of some cases, requires action from the Government to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent most effectively and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/2">Following the consultation, the Government will introduce measures which will:</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/3" class="indent">introduce a financial threshold of 5 hours for the initial decision-making process, which can only be exceeded with prior authority of the LSC;</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/4" class="indent">ensure that no legal aid work is undertaken in asylum appeal cases without prior approval from the Legal Services Commission, which will set financial thresholds in individual cases which pass a merits test for legal aid;</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/5" class="indent">introduce accreditation for all lawyers and case-workers doing legally aided asylum work;</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/6" class="indent">introduce a Unique Client Number to reduce unnecessary changes of solicitor.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/7">The LSC will have the power to vary the financial threshold up or down for individual firms whose track record justifies this. The LSC will also continue to allow top quality firms with a good track record on appeal cases to proceed without prior authority up to a set financial threshold. Any autonomy granted by the LSC will have to be earned.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/8">These measures will apply in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/9">The Consultation</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/10">We outlined three proposals:</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/11" class="indent">a curb on the amount of time for which lawyers would be paid in individual cases;</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/12" class="indent">accreditation of lawyers and other case-workers to ensure quality representation;</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/13" class="indent">the introduction of a Unique Client Number to prevent unnecessary changes of solicitor.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/14">We received 260 responses to the Consultation Paper. The House of Commons Constitutional Affairs Committee also inquired into our proposals and reported on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-31">31 October 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/15">There was overwhelming support for the introduction of accreditation and the Unique File Number. There was widespread concern about the proposals to curb the amount of time for which lawyers would be paid in individual cases. Respondents also made many suggestions about where savings might be achieved and there was some criticism of Home Office systems and procedures. Officials from the Home Office, Department for Constitutional Affairs and Legal Services Commission are examining the initial decision-making stage of the asylum process, with particular regard to the role that legal aid and publicly funded practitioners play. This work may lead to further changes in the way that legal aid for asylum seekers is delivered beyond those now proposed. In particular, consideration is being given as to whether legal aid is needed at the initial stage in all cases. The Government will make a further announcement on any further changes in due course. We are very grateful for all the responses, and especially the report of the Constitutional Affairs Committee. We have considered carefully all the points which have been made.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/16">Our Revised Proposals</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/17">In our consultation paper, we proposed that there should be a cap of 5 hours' work at the initial stage, that is prior to the initial decision by the Home Office as to whether asylum should be granted. There would be higher caps for stated exceptions. We now propose that there should instead be a financial threshold for preparation time allowed for the generality of cases up to the initial decision for asylum cases. The norm for this threshold will be 5 hours. The LSC will also introduce a threshold for immigration non-asylum cases. This will normally be between 3 and 5 hours depending on the circumstances of the case. Once this threshold is reached, suppliers will only be allowed to proceed under legal aid with prior authority from the LSC. Professional disbursements and VAT will not count towards these thresholds. The LSC will introduce separate thresholds for professional disbursements which require prior authority to exceed. Extensions are only likely to be granted, on application to the LSC, in genuine and complex cases where there is a real prospect of success. The LSC propose to allow a limited number of firms, where it is confident work is to a high standard, devolved powers to self-grant to a higher figure.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/18">In all but exceptional cases (unaccompanied minors; applicants going through fast-track initial decision processes; those suffering from a recognised and verifiable mental incapacity which makes it impractical to undergo an interview without support) funding for attendance by a representative at the substantive asylum interview will not be authorised. The LSC will introduce rules to ensure that in these exceptional cases where attendance at interview is authorised, this will be by the advisor in the case or the immigration supervisor, not by an agent or outdoor clerk, until accreditation is introduced.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/19">Before any preparatory work can be carried out under legal aid for an asylum appeal, the LSC will need to be satisfied itself that the case merits being pursued. Currently, this decision can be made by individual firms. There will therefore be no guarantee of any legally aided work being allowed at the appeals stage in individual cases. If, however, the LSC is satisfied that the appeal case merits representation, it will set a financial threshold up to which firms will be able to work before they need to seek an extension from the LSC. Thresholds would be set for individual cases depending on the facts of the case, and the experience and previous outcomes of the firm. As now, applicants will be able to seek a review of refusal of funding by the LSC for an appeal against rejection of their asylum claim, but any such review will be considered on the papers only.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/20">The LSC will proceed with a fixed fee of &pound;150 plus VAT for applications for leave to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/21">The LSC is presently finalising the details of the skills and competencies required for each of three levels of accreditation now being proposed. It will then invite the Law Society to recruit independent assessment organisations which will ensure that all advisers undergo objective tests of their competence and evaluation of a portfolio of work conducted. As set out in our original proposals, those on the most rigorous advanced level will be entitled to increased remuneration as a result of their skill and experience for work they personally conduct. This we propose to be at 5 per cent. above current rates.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/22">The Unique Client Number will be required to be used for all dealings between advisers and the LSC in a case once it has been issued, and will be submitted with all claims for payment once an initial decision has been made.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/23">In addition, the LSC will also consult over limiting choice of representative in locations where fast-track procedures are in operation to dedicated duty representatives authorised under contract. This is intended to prevent touting and poaching of clients at centres such as Oakington and Harmondsworth which currently leads to wasteful duplication of resources. The LSC will also consult over the use of experts in asylum cases, whether it is necessary to have a separate interpreter at substantive asylum interviews for the client, in those exceptional cases where funding is authorised for attendance by a representative at the substantive asylum interview and whether there should be a fixed fee for advocacy before the adjudicators in order to ensure value for money is obtained. Implementation</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/24">The introduction of prior authorisation by the LSC in every asylum and immigration case (with the exception of 5 hours for advice at the initial stage and any other earned autonomy granted by the LSC) will require a significant change in processes and procedure which will take some time to bed in efficiently. There will therefore be a transitional additional 2 hours at the initial stage for most firms before extensions are required from the LSC. The timetable will be as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/25" class="indent">Transitional 7 hour threshold for initial stage applies to suppliers in London on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-01">1 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/26" class="indent">Transitional 7 hour threshold for initial stage applies to all other suppliers on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/27" class="indent">5 hour threshold for initial stage applies to all suppliers in England and Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/28" class="indent">Authorisation from LSC required for appeals from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/29">The thresholds will apply to all work whether done on new or old cases started after introduction.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/30">Accreditation will be introduced from April 2004, and will become compulsory by April 2005. The Unique Client Number will be introduced from April 2004. The requirement to apply to the LSC for prior approval to appeal an initial Home Office decision will also apply from April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/31">Savings</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/32">These revised proposals are estimated to save around &pound;30 million in 2004&ndash;05 against what we would be spending were we not to introduce prior authorisation.</p>
	<p pid=".34WS.2/33">Taken together, these measures will bring asylum legal aid under effective control and cut out unnecessary expenditure. Costs will be limited, and targeted at the most deserving cases. Quality representation will be recognised and rewarded by the new accreditation scheme, and wasteful duplication of cases will be ended.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-11-27.40WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1162" speakername="Chris Pond" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions" colnum="40WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo031127/wmstext/31127m09.htm#31127m09.html_spmin3">
	<p pid=".40WS.1/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) follow-up inspection report on Jobcentre Plus' relationship with local authorities was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/2">In September 2001, the BFI published its report on the then Benefits Agency's relationship with local authorities and made 49 recommendations to address weaknesses in benefits administration and counter-fraud activity, and improve closer working with local authorities. Since then the Benefits Agency has become part of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/3">Jobcentre Plus came into existence in April 2002 bringing together parts of the Benefits Agency and the whole of Employment Service. This resulted in significant changes to the organisational structure since the first BFI inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/4">It is important that Jobcentre Plus works closely with local authorities to ensure that:</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/5" class="indent">the processing of benefit claims and their ongoing maintenance are made as simple and speedy as possible with the minimum of duplication. The fullest possible sharing of information helps ensure that customers receive the highest attainable levels of service;</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/6" class="indent">information that could lead to the identification of fraud and error is routinely shared so that joint action can be taken to eliminate overpayments;</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/7" class="indent">the welfare of customers, and staff of local authorities and Jobcentre Plus, is protected by the sharing of good working practices and regular exchange of information.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/8">In 2003, BFI inspected Jobcentre Plus to determine the effectiveness of its working relationships with local authorities and see how the recommendations from the first report had been progressed by the new organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/9">Particular improvements highlighted in the report include the recruitment of Regional Fraud and Programme Protection Managers to work closely with local authorities and the successful roll out of electronic transfer of data systems. Both local authorities and Jobcentre Plus reported this had a positive impact on the relationship.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/10">The BFI did find that many of the 49 recommendations from its earlier report had not been carried out. Specific areas identified for improvement included training staff in liaison duties, ensuring that joint working with local authorities features sufficiently in business plans and securing better management information at a national level on joint working performance. However, the report found that there was variation in performance, with some Jobcentre Plus offices making greater effort than others in their relationships with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/11">The report finds examples of good practice and some improvements since the first inspection. However, the report makes 45 recommendations to help Jobcentre Plus address the weaknesses and to further improve the working relationship with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".40WS.1/12">Jobcentre Plus is announcing its Action Plan for dealing with the BFI's recommendations, and is to set up a Senior Steering Group, including local authority representation, to oversee the implementation of the BFI's recommendations and report progress to Ministers on a quarterly basis.</p>
