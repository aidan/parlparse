	<p pid="a.61WS.2/1">The Cabinet Secretary and the First Civil Service Commissioner will tomorrow launch consultation on a new Civil Service Code. The Civil Service Code, which was introduced in 1996, sets out the duties and responsibilities of civil servants. Copies are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/2">The new Code is the result of work between the Government and the Civil Service Commissioners to ensure that the Code is relevant and accessible to all civil servants. The Code sets out the core values of the Civil Service and the standards of behaviour expected of all civil servants in their dealings with Ministers, the public, other organisations the Civil Service works with and its many customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/3">In publishing the new Code for consultation, the Government wish to place on record its appreciation to the former First Civil Service Commissioner, Baroness Usha Prashar, for her contribution in taking forward work on the new Code.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/4">Comments are invited on the new Code. The consultation period will run until <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 21 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.61WS.2/5">Copies of the new Code will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-01-26a.67WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1981" speakername="Alistair Darling" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="67WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060126/wmstext/60126m03.htm#60126m03.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/1">Today we have published a consultation document on the implementation of the provisions in the Railways Act 2005 relating to network changes. The consultation covers the guidance which the Secretary of State is required to issue on circumstances in which rail closures should be allowed. It also covers when more minor modifications should be allowed, and will replace existing guidance that becomes obsolete when the Strategic Rail Authority is formally wound-up later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/2">The Government want more passengers to use the railways. Indeed, Britain now has the fastest growing railway in Europe. The Government are also committed to increasing investment in the railways. But from time to time, as in any industry, changes to service provision will be necessary to reflect passenger and freight demand. That is why there needs to be an open and transparent process to allow these changes to be made. The Railways Act 2005 allows that to happen&mdash;hence this consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/3">This guidance will ensure that safeguards and standard practices are applied to any proposals for changes on the rail network. For the first time, statutory guidance will be put in place on rail closures, making procedures clearer and more transparent. It will also ensure certain procedures are taken into account before any rail closure can be considered. The draft guidance requires that:</p>
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/4" class="indent">All alternatives are considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/5" class="indent">A full consultation takes place and that this includes passenger groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/6" class="indent">The current and future impact on passengers are considered as well as the safety, economic and environmental costs or benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/7" class="indent">In contrast with current procedures, where the Secretary of State determines closure proposals, the independent Office of Rail Regulation must be satisfied that a robust economic analysis has been performed.</p>
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/8">The document published today seeks views on the proposed implementation of this legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.67WS.1/9">Copies of the consultation have been laid in the House Library and the deadline for responses is the <phrase class="date" code="">21 April 2006</phrase>. The existing procedure for closures will remain in place until the responses to the consultation have been considered and a final version of the new guidance has been laid before Parliament. It will continue to be administered by the Strategic Rail Authority during this period. This will be the Authority's sole responsibility after <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>, and will only require a minimal number of staff.</p>
