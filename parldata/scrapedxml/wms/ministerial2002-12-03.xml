	<p>When the destroyer HMS NOTTINGHAM grounded in Australian waters on 7 July 2002 she sustained severe damage and flooding in the forward part of the ship. She is now on passage to the UK on a heavy lift ship and is expected to arrive in United Kingdom waters on 7 December. She will then be unloaded and towed into HM Naval Base at Portsmouth where a contract has been placed for her repair with Fleet Support Limited. The repair work&mdash;which will cost around &pound;26M, including all materials supplied by the Department&mdash;is expected to last up to 18 months. HMS NOTTINGHAM is expected to return to operational service in November 2004.</p>
	<p>HMS NOTTINGHAM is a highly capable Type 42 destroyer designed to provide area air defence either independently or as an integral component of larger joint or coalition maritime task groups. Her key weapons, sensors and Command System were significantly upgraded during an extensive refit in 1999&ndash;2000. These improvements will enable the ship to keep pace with the increasing demands of maritime air defence during the next 10 years and will aid interoperability with key allies, in particular the USA. HMS NOTTINGHAM's contribution will be crucial to bridging the air defence gap during the drawdown in Sea Harrier air defence aircraft beginning in 2005 and the introduction of the Type 45 Destroyer from 2007.</p>
	<p>To ease the short-term programming gap in the fleet created by HMS NOTTINGHAM's unavailability, HMS GLASGOW, an older and less capable Type 42 is being regenerated from a planned state of lower readiness. An alternative solution which would have given HMS GLASGOW a similar capability upgrade to that received by HMS NOTTINGHAM in 1999 was considered, but the repair of HMS NOTTINGHAM was deemed to provide best value for money.</p>

	Service Pensions (Taxation)

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2002-12-03.70WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1118" speakername="Lewis Moonie" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="70WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021203/wmstext/21203m01.htm#21203m01.html_spmin2">
	<p>On 25 April 2002 <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-04-25.426"><i>Official Report</i> Column 426</phrase>&mdash;27W, I informed the House that the problem of mistaken taxation of some Service invalidity pensions was more extensive than previously understood. I reported that we had set up an internal review, independent of the staffs involved, to establish the extent of the taxation errors and expose any related problems. This review is now complete.</p>
	<p>The review has established that the taxation problem is more extensive than I indicated in April. It is now clear that some RAF pensions are affected, and that the RN pensions affected are not limited to the period 1973&ndash;99. In addition, the review has found that further work is needed on Army pensions; this is required both to re-examine more thoroughly certain cases adjudged when first reviewed as correctly taxed, and to examine for the first time some other cases previously not thought to be at risk.</p>
	<p>The findings of the review mean that the number of files needing examination has proved considerably larger than I stated previously. I now expect it will not be possible to complete a comprehensive check for all three Services before next summer. I regret that this work cannot be done faster, but it is vital that it be done accurately, by suitably cleared staff who are also familiar with the relevant documents. The pace of the work is also affected by the lack of comprehensive computerised information distinguishing invalidity pensions from others. This has made it necessary to handle many tens of thousands of files which are not at risk in order to identify those that are. This difficulty continues to affect progress.</p>
	<p>We are very much aware of the importance of giving as much priority as possible to examining the cases of our oldest pensioners. Although over 70 per cent. of errors identified so far affect younger pensioners, discharged in or after 1990, we anticipate that errors still to be found will include some affecting the oldest age-group. I much regret that in several of the cases recently re-examined a pensioner, previously misadvised that his pension was correctly taxed, has died before an error was recognised. In such cases the tax refund is to be paid, with due apology, to the pensioner's widow or estate.</p>
	<p>A further problem brought to light by the review is that some of the pensions taxed in error were also affected by an underpayment of Armed Forces Pension Scheme benefits. Over 350 pensioners have so far been identified in this category, most of whom were discharged in the 1990s. The average underpayment in these cases was around &pound;4,500. The cost to date of rectifying tax errors has been some &pound;5M, which happens also to be an average of some &pound;4,500 per pensioner.</p>
	<p>The review includes a full analysis of the causes of errors and the necessary remedial action; the latter is already in hand. The procedures used in the conduct of the review have been validated by the National Audit Office. The NAO's letter of validation and the report of the review have been placed in the library of the House.</p>

	<p>I have written to Sir Trevor Chinn, the chairman of the Motorists' Forum, welcoming their report on car sharing and car clubs and enclosing the Government's response. The response outlines further support that the Government will give to work in this field, in particular:</p>
	<p class="indent">continued funding for an advisory service on car clubs and formal car sharing schemes;</p>
	<p class="indent">further research to monitor car clubs in circumstances that offer the most potential for success, for example where they may help to achieve higher densities in new residential developments than might otherwise be the case; and</p>
	<p class="indent">further research on formal car sharing schemes in institutional settings, such as the workplace, with a view to publishing best practice guidance later next year.</p>
	<p>Copies of my letter and the Government response have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p>Legislation governing public service pensions requires public service pensions to be increased annually by the same percentage as State earnings related pensions (additional pensions). My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced on 19 November 2002, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2002-11-19.16WS"><i>Official Report</i> Column 16WS</phrase> that benefits such as additional pensions will be increased by 1.7 per cent., in line with the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index up to September 2002. Public service pensions will therefore be increased by 1.7 per cent. from 7 April 2003, except those which have been in payment for less than a year, which will receive a pro-rata increase.</p>

</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2002-12-03.73WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/739" speakername="David Blunkett" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="73WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021203/wmstext/21203m02.htm#21203m02.html_spmin2">
	<p>All controlled drugs are harmful and will remain illegal. Drug misuse is the biggest challenge society faces. It damages the health and life chances of individuals. It undermines family life, turns law-abiding citizens into thieves and erodes communities. It is essential that we educate the young about the dangers of drugs, prevent drug misuse, tackle the dealers to reduce the prevalence of drugs on the streets and reduce the harm drugs cause.</p>
	<p>To address this, the Government has published its Updated Drug Strategy developed to take account of new evidence of what works and focus on delivery.</p>
	<p>In 1998, the first cross-cutting strategy was introduced to tackle drug trafficking, supply and misuse. This update builds on the foundations laid and the lessons learnt. We must concentrate on the most dangerous drugs, the most damaged communities and the individuals whose addiction and chaotic lifestyles are the most harmful, both to themselves and others. Education, prevention, enforcement, treatment and harm minimisation are our most powerful tools.</p>
	<p>Setting out a range of policies and interventions, the Updated Drug Strategy provides:</p>
	<p class="indent">a tougher focus on Class A drugs;</p>
	<p class="indent">a stronger focus on education, enforcement and treatment to prevent and tackle problematic drug use;</p>
	<p class="indent">more resources&mdash;direct annual expenditure for tackling drugs will rise from &pound;1,026 million in this financial year to &pound;1,244 million in the next financial year, &pound;1,344 million in the year starting April 2004 to a total annual spend of nearly &pound;1.5 billion in the year starting April 2005&mdash;an increase of 44 per cent;</p>
	<p class="indent">a major new education campaign to be launched in Spring 2003 to drive home the risks of drug misuse. More support for parents, carers and families so they can easily access advice, help, counselling and mutual support;</p>
	<p class="indent">more help for the young people most at risk of developing drug problems through increased outreach and community treatment and an extension of drug testing and referrals to treatment and care via the youth justice system so that by 2006, we are able to support 40,000&ndash;50,000 vulnerable young people a year;</p>
	<p class="indent">strengthened enforcement- including new cross-regional police teams to tackle middle markets and targeted policing to crack down on crack;</p>
	<p class="indent">a major expansion of services to refer people into treatment via the criminal justice system. We will use every opportunity from arrest, to court and sentence to identify drug-misusing offenders and engage them in treatment. Starting from next year in the highest crime areas with the worst drug problems we will roll out a comprehensive end to end approach. This will ensure that every drug addicted offender is identified through drug testing at the point of arrest and charge and given the choice at their bail hearing of entering treatment rather than entering custody. All this is backed up by extra resources for arrest referral, drug treatment and testing orders, treatment in prison and Youth Offending Institutes and for post-release treatment and support for those leaving custody;</p>
	<p class="indent">an expansion of treatment services to ensure access is available when needed and is tailored to individual need, including residential treatment. Improved treatment for crack and cocaine users and heroin prescribing properly supervised for all those who would clinically benefit from it. By 2008, we will have developed the capacity to treat 200,000 problematic drug users each year. Funding for treatment services, including prisons, will increase by &pound;45 million in the next financial year, &pound;54 million for the year starting from April 2004 and &pound;115 million from April 2005. This will be boosted by treatment funding associated with Drug Treatment and Testing Orders of nearly &pound;10 million in the next financial year, &pound;12 million in the year starting from April 2004 and &pound;16 million from April 2005&mdash;bringing the total direct annual spend on treatment up to &pound;589 million by 2005;</p>
	<p class="indent">new aftercare and throughcare services to help those leaving prison or treatment remain free from drugs;</p>
	<p class="indent">strengthened capacity to deliver first in the areas with the greatest problems and improved services in those areas most affected by crack use; and</p>
	<p class="indent">revised targets which are challenging but achievable.</p>
	<p>Copies of &quot;Updated Drug Strategy 2002 &quot; have been placed in the Library. It is also available on the web at <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk">http://www.drugs.gov.uk</a>.</p>
