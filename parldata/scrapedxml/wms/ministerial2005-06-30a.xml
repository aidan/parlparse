	<p pid="a.65WS.8/1">Following the Prime Minister's launch of the UK Government sustainable development strategy &quot;Securing the Future&quot; in March this year, we have today published baseline assessments of the indicators with which we will monitor progress. These are contained in the statistical publication &quot;Sustainable Development Indicators in your Pocket 2005&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.65WS.8/2">This handy, accessible booklet presents 68 indicators through which we can monitor our success in delivering against key priorities within the strategy: Sustainable consumption and production, climate change and energy. Natural resource protection and environmental enhancement, and sustainable communities. Twenty of the indicators are shared with the devolved administrations within our shared framework for sustainable development &quot;One future&mdash;different paths&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.65WS.8/3">The UK is already a leader in measuring and communicating its progress to deliver sustainable development. This new set of indicators and new booklet builds further on this. It is hoped that we will reach a wide audience and through the booklet help to promote sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="a.65WS.8/4">Copies of the booklet will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.66WS.8/1">The House will be aware of allegations that have been made in <i>The Times</i> in the last few days about potential fraud in the handling of coal health compensation claims. I wish to make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/2">These schemes are a major priority for the Government. To date over &pound;2.6 billion has already been paid to former miners, their widows and families. Over 700,000 claims are being processed in what is a major delivery exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/3">It is also important to understand that the Department is acting in respect of the schemes under the jurisdiction of the High Court. This is because the schemes are the result of group litigation and delivery is overseen by judges who are still in charge of the cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/4">The matters which the police are currently investigating arise from discussions which my Department had with the Law Society which in turn led to the discovery of information which the Law Society referred to the South Yorkshire police. A full criminal investigation is now underway and we are in close touch with the Police.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/5">No charges have, however, yet been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/6">The House will understand that in the circumstances I am unable to comment on the nature of the police investigations. I do, however, wish to make it very clear that there is nothing in the matters which are being investigated to suggest that there is any fraud against claimants. Nor is it a matter of the UDM having a preferential agreement; they do not. The investigation is focused solely on issues related to the costs of handling claims and not the payment of compensation to claimants.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/7">I have decided, however, to take a number of immediate steps:</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/8" class="indent">my Department has today written to the UDM seeking a complete list of claims which have been submitted through the UDM. That will enable us to ensure that any potential fraud is capped.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/9" class="indent">we have invited the UDM to set out what immediate actions they intend to take in respect of the individuals subject to investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/10" class="indent">I have asked the chief constable of South Yorkshire police to press ahead with the investigation with all speed and assured him of the Department's full co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/11" class="indent">we have contacted the judges involved in the schemes to keep them fully informed of what we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/12" class="indent">we have written to the Law Society asking for an urgent report on the issues they have been considering on double charging by solicitors, although recognising that double charging is not the subject of the fraud investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/13">I must stress that I regard these as preliminary steps. I am fully prepared to take further actions as necessary. For example I have certainly not ruled out the option of suspending the operation of the UDM contract while the police inquiries continue. I have therefore asked officials and our claim handlers to assess what impact such action might have on the schedule for the payment of claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/14">I would ask the House, however, to note two points:</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/15">first, nothing I do now should inhibit or compromise the need for the police to carry out the inquiries;</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/16">secondly, I am very anxious to avoid taking any steps which could compromise the prompt payment of claims to applicants. The schemes are highly complex and it is not easy to make changes in the administrative arrangements without risking the introduction of delays&mdash;and we have to recognise that a number of those whose applications are being processed are both elderly and not in the best of health.</p>
	<p pid="a.66WS.8/17">I will keep the House informed of developments.</p>

	<p pid="a.68WS.2/1">I have today given conditional approval to a scheme to refurbish Manchester Metrolink.</p>
	<p pid="a.68WS.2/2">The scheme put forward by Greater Manchester passenger transport executive includes the renewal of existing tracks on the Bury to Altringham line and the purchase of eight new vehicles to reduce overcrowding on the Metrolink system.</p>
	<p pid="a.68WS.2/3">The scheme will bring noticeable improvements in the quality of journeys for existing users of Manchester's Metrolink and offer an attractive alternative to those currently driving into the centre of Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.68WS.2/4">Conditional approval demonstrates our support for the improvements. Providing costs and other details remain unchanged, we would expect to grant full approval in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.68WS.2/5">I am committing Government funding of up to &pound;58 million towards the costs of the scheme, subject to full approval subsequently being granted. This funding is part of the &pound;520 million which the Government have already pledged for the areas served by the Metrolink phase III proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.68WS.2/6">My officials will work closely with Greater Manchester passenger transport executive over the next few months to finalise details of the scheme.</p>
