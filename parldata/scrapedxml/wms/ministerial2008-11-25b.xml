	<p pid="b.46WS.1/1">The Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday announced as part of the pre-Budget report a temporary reduction in the standard rate of VAT to 15 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> when the rate will return to 17 &frac12; per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/2">This Government have taken these steps to provide further support for growth and incomes during the economic downturn. The Government's discretionary fiscal action will deliver support of around 1 per cent. of GDP to the economy in total in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/3">However, it is also important that the Government protect the public finances from artificial avoidance seeking to exploit the change in VAT rates where there is no current economic activity. Therefore, Finance Bill 2009 will contain anti-forestalling legislation to ensure that the VAT rate changes announced are fully effective. The Government will expose the draft legislation for comment as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/4">Anti-forestalling legislation will apply from today to ensure that, in the circumstances set out below, supplies with a basic time of supply after a VAT rate increase takes effect will be subject to the rate of VAT in force at that time. The provisions are designed to prevent artificial forestalling while being straightforward for business to understand and operate and not affecting genuine commercial transactions. This legislation is not intended to catch the normal commercial activity of providing goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/5">The anti-forestalling legislation will apply in the circumstances set out below where the supplier receives a prepayment for the goods or services or issues a VAT invoice in advance of the rate increase. It will also apply where, in advance of the rate increase, the supplier grants the customer an option or a right to obtain goods or services at a discount or free of charge after the rate increase takes effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/6">The circumstances are that the customer cannot recover VAT in full on the supply and that:</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/7" class="indent">the supplier and customer are connected parties; or</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/8" class="indent">the supplier receives a prepayment, or grants the customer an option or a right, and the prepayment, or the acquisition of the option or right, is wholly or partly funded (directly or indirectly) by the supplier; or</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/9" class="indent">a VAT invoice is issued by the supplier showing an amount any part of which is due more than six months after the date of the invoice.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/10">The basic time of supply is normally when goods are delivered or made available, or when services are performed. For continuous supplies of goods or services, with consideration payable periodically or from time to time, the basic time of supply will be the end of the period to which a payment or invoice relates (that is, a billing period).</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/11">Although the anti-forestalling legislation will apply from today, any extra VAT arising from its operation will not become due until after Royal Assent of Finance Bill 2009. Until then, suppliers should continue to account for VAT as normal, applying the VAT rate at the time of the prepayment, VAT invoice issue or grant of the right or option.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.1/12">The operation of the legislation will be kept under review to ensure that the provisions work as intended. Any additional or alternative anti-forestalling provisions included in Finance Bill 2009 will only take effect at the earliest from the date that they are announced.</p>

	<p pid="b.57WS.1/1">I am delighted to announce today the publication of &quot;Place Matters: The Location Strategy for the United Kingdom&quot;, which has been prepared for me by the UK Geographic Information Panel. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.1/2">The UK location strategy is a thoughtful, authoritative and important document and its recommendations are closely aligned to the delivery of Government policy in many areas. Ministerial colleagues share with me in recognising the reality identified by the strategy that 'everything happens somewhere'. The Government acknowledge that a better understanding of location is an important factor in moving forward the transformational Government agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.1/3">Implementation of the location strategy will maximise the value to the public, Government and UK industry of the use of geographic information. It will provide a consistent framework to assist national, regional and local initiatives and service delivery for the benefit of all our people. Key areas where the location strategy will be of benefit are in policy and operational areas of the public and private sector, where shared and integrated place-based information is essential for decision making. It will also be the basis for delivering the United Kingdom's obligations under the European INSPIRE directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.1/4">The Government now wish to build on the progress represented by publication of the location strategy. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has agreed to lead implementation of the location strategy alongside INSPIRE; implementation planning has commenced. Agreement has been reached that the initial phases of implementation will be funded by contributions that will be drawn from key stakeholder Departments across Government. A key early deliverable is the establishment of a UK location council, to be chaired by DEFRA, and I am also pleased to announce that Government have approved the actions necessary to set up the location council. It will continue the excellent work undertaken by the UK Geographic Information Panel, which will now be dissolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.1/5">I wish to place on record my thanks to the UK Geographic Information Panel, chaired by Vanessa Lawrence CB, for its excellent work in conceiving, developing and championing the UK location strategy to this point.</p>

	Coalition Regional Commands (Iraq)

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-11-25b.57WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" speakername="John Hutton" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="57WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/wmstext/81125m0005.htm#08112560000914">
	<p pid="b.57WS.4/1">I should like to make a statement on the restructuring of coalition regional commands in Iraq and the implications for the ongoing UK mission there.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.4/2">As the Iraqi security forces have grown and matured, coalition forces across Iraq have been able to move increasingly into over-watch and mentoring operations. These successes have allowed coalition forces and structures to be rationalised and combat forces from several nations have been able to return home. The UK has also been able to reduce the scale of its deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.4/3">Until recently, the area south of Baghdad was divided into three multi-national divisional areas&mdash;MND-Centre under US control, MND-Centre South under Polish control and MND-South East under UK control. In future, it is anticipated that only a single multi-national divisional headquarters will be required south of Baghdad, given that the Iraqi security forces now have the lead in providing the security for all nine provinces in this area. As part of this restructuring, MND-Centre merged with MND-Centre South as Polish forces completed their mission and MND-Centre has now also taken over over-watch from MND-South East of the three provinces Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan. This new US divisional area is called MND-Centre. Security in these three provinces is provided by the 10th Division of the Iraqi army&mdash;previously trained by UK and Australian forces&mdash;and therefore this boundary move does not affect any UK forces which are focused in Basrah. This restructuring of divisional areas is therefore an adjustment to reflect better both the dispositions of coalition and Iraqi forces on the ground and the continuing improvements in security. This new divisional area will remain MND-Centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.4/4">MND-South East, which now consists solely of Basrah province, remains focused on developing the rapidly improving 14th Division. The delivery of 14th Division was defined by the Prime Minister in his <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July</phrase> statement as one of the decisive conditions for transition and it is therefore right that this is where UK forces concentrate their efforts. As the Iraqi security forces increasingly take responsibility for providing security, the role and shape of the coalition will naturally evolve as efforts increasingly focus on economic development, reconstruction and capacity building.</p>

	<p pid="b.58WS.1/1">I attended an informal meeting of NATO Defence Ministers in Budapest, Hungary, on 9 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-10">10 October 2008</phrase>. It provided an important opportunity for discussions on operations and on the transformation of NATO capabilities, following the informal Defence Ministers' meeting in London on 18 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-19">19 September 2008</phrase>, which was attended by my predecessor as Secretary of State for Defence, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" name="Des Browne">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.1/2">The main focus of the meeting in London was the continuing transformation of the alliance. Ministers expressed their strong support for NATO transformation and for proposals made during the meeting to increase the targets for allies' deployable capabilities. Over dinner, Ministers reflected on the implications for NATO of the events in Georgia in the preceding months. There was consensus that collective defence and discretionary, out-of-area operations required the same expeditionary capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.1/3">The focus of the meeting in Budapest was on current operations. This was the first ministerial meeting in which Albania and Croatia participated fully. Ministers underlined the importance of the NATO operation in Afghanistan, and in response to a request from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, directed ISAF to take action, with the Afghan authorities, against narcotics facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency within priority regions. Ministers stated their continued support for NATO's KFOR mission and its work in providing a safe and secure environment in Kosovo. On Afghanistan, NATO Ministers also had a meeting with their counterparts from non-NATO nations making valuable contributions to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, together with the Defence Minister of Afghanistan, the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan and a European Union senior representative.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.1/4">At the request of the United Nations, Ministers agreed that NATO will contribute to deter piracy in the waters off the coast of Somalia, by providing a number of ships from the Alliance's Standing Naval Maritime Group to patrol the waters off the coast of Somalia and escort ships carrying food supplies for the world food programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.58WS.1/5">At the meeting, Ministers re-affirmed the importance that they attach to developing deployable capabilities and agreed to increase targets for the deployability of allies' land forces. In addition, the first ministerial-level meeting of the NATO-Georgia Commission took place, where the Defence Minister for Georgia set out the Georgian Government's priorities in security and defence policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.60WS.2/1">I and Huw Irranca-Davies represented the United Kingdom at November's Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels. Richard Lochhead, Conor Murphy and Elin Jones also attended.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/2">All of the 'A' points were adopted.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/3">On fisheries the Council reached agreement by unanimity on a new regulation to establish elements for a medium-term multi-annual framework to allow for the recovery and management of cod stocks. Following an initial table round and bilateral discussions with the most interested member states, the presidency was able to reach agreement with the Commission and so table a final compromise. The final compromise represents a balance between those offering appropriate protection for the stocks, and the opportunity to encourage sustainable fishing. The main elements are:</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/4" class="indent">Targets expressed in terms of fishing mortality, rather than the previous approach of increased spawning stock biomass, over which fleets have no control. In all sea areas the target is 0.4;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/5" class="indent">Mortality reductions in the first year of 25 per cent. They will then be set at 10 per cent. annually for the North sea and, depending on biomass levels, either 25 per cent., 15 per cent. or 10 per cent. elsewhere until the target mortality rate is reached;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/6" class="indent">For quota setting, constraints on the movements of TACs of 20 per cent. for the North sea and 15 per cent. elsewhere. The North sea constraint will not apply to quota increases in 2009;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/7" class="indent">The allocation kW day effort &quot;pots&quot; to member states and allows them to administer their own effort to reward sustainable fishing; adjusted on an annual basis. This extends these arrangements based on collaboration with the fishing industry, and pioneered in the UK (both Scotland and England) as possibilities to all member states. The effort levels will be based on the average deployed either during 2004-06 or 2005-07, as member states wish;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/8" class="indent">The geographical scope is extended further to the west of Scotland to include the vast majority of cod catches;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/9" class="indent">The Celtic sea remains outside the scope of the plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/10">Member states then re-enforced their priorities for the final round of negotiations scheduled to finalise the EU-Norway fisheries agreement. The Commission noted the difficulty of resolving member states' conflicting views on which stocks should be used to pay for the balance of access to Arctic cod, Norway's strong desire for progress on discard reductions and the willingness of Norway to accept a modest TAC increase. The UK noted that decisions on cod TAC needed to be taken with Norway and should be part of a wider package, including in cod recovery. We also supported the wider principle on discards issue, but noted the need for more technical work.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/11">The Council held an initial exchange of views on the Commission's very recent proposal to reform the regulation that governs member states' responsibilities to enforce fisheries regulations. This is a recognised area of weakness in the common fisheries policy framework, and in which nearly all fishing member states have a weak record. The Commission noted that improvement should not wait for the general CFP reform in 2012. The new proposal would encourage a culture of compliance by all in the sector; those who break the rules should not benefit; a penalty points system would lead to licence withdrawal of licence where necessary. It would introduce a new common approach to control and inspection to all stages of the chain; including import, transport and at market; using modern technologies and risk analyses. Control and enforcement are member states' exclusive competence and this would reaffirm their complementary roles with the Commission. It offered more flexibility for quota reductions or financial penalties where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/12">Nearly all fishing member states spoke briefly to acknowledge the general need for improvement, the need to avoid over-bureaucratic requirements and to support compliance by industry. France was the most dubious about the ease of progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/13">With regard to aquaculture, member states discussed the future of the aquaculture sector based on a Commission non-paper and a presidency questionnaire. The Commission expressed concerns that the EU industry's output seemed to be stagnating while that of third countries were continuing to expand and explained that they planned to publish a communication next spring on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/14">There was general support for simplification of the legislation and of the administrative procedures but disagreement on whether the environmental legislation needed amending to reflect the needs of the aquaculture sector. While there was some support for the EFF giving more attention to the aquaculture sector there was also a clear rejection from UK, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany for any extra funds to be made available. Most landlocked member states asked for a differentiation to be made in the EFF rules between inland and marine aquaculture. Many member states called for a community promotion campaign and there were also general calls for a community action plan to deal with the problem of cormorant predation. The UK and Slovenia mentioned the importance of reducing the input of wild fish protein. There was a clear rejection of the French suggestion that the Community had a role to play in questions concerning zoning.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/15">Finally on fisheries, the Council noted reports from the Commission on recent measures to simplify CFP regulations, and on Poland's significant recent progress to comply with the regulation on quota reduction and stricter enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/16">On agriculture items, the Council reached majority agreement on the CAP Health Check&mdash;the scheduled review and adjustment of the mechanisms of the EU's common agricultural policy, which was intended to improve, reinforce and build on the 2003 CAP reforms. However the UK did not support the final deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/17">The UK set out its ambitions for the Health Check in April. We made it clear then that we wanted to cut further the trade distorting nature of the CAP, reduce regulatory burdens, give farmers greater control over their business decisions, and redirect more CAP spending away from direct farm payments towards delivery of targeted public benefits. Progress has been made in these areas, often in the face of opposition from other member states, but we are also disappointed that some new distortions have been introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/18">The Health Check took a number of positive steps in reforming the CAP, which the UK welcomes. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/19" class="indent">Further decoupling of approximately &pound;3 billion of direct farm payments&mdash;reducing the market distortions faced by UK farmers and making farmers across the EU more responsive to market signals in important sectors such as arable crops - although this decoupling could be significantly reduced if member states fully utilise payments under national envelopes under article 68.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/20" class="indent">The phase-out of the remaining processing aid schemes for dried fodder, starch, flax and hemp;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/21" class="indent">Further reductions in the intervention system, including the abolition of intervention for pigmeat, butter for manufacture and butter for direct consumption;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/22" class="indent">Agreement on the process for phasing out milk quotas by 2015, including a 1 per cent. per year increase in quotas over the next five years&mdash;although other aspects of the final deal involve differential increases for some member states, while two scheduled reviews of the dairy market could create uncertainty for the dairy industry;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/23" class="indent">Reducing red tape for farmers through some simplification of direct farm payments and the requirements of cross-compliance;</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/24" class="indent">An increased focus on environmental benefits across Europe, by increasing the rate of compulsory modulation to 10 per cent. by 2012, and therefore increasing the share of CAP funding that goes towards environment and rural development schemes. This will reduce the gap in modulation between the UK and the rest of the EU, leading to a more level playing field for UK farmers.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/25" class="indent">The ending of compulsory set-aside, leaving farmers free to take their own production decisions based on market circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/26" class="indent">Flexibility in the new cross-compliance requirements to allow member states to pursue options for capturing the environmental benefits of set-aside that is appropriate to local environments.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/27">The UK is concerned about some aspects of the Health Check, in particular the market distortions created by the increased flexibility in the use of &quot;national envelopes&quot; which allow member states to support specific sectors using payments coupled to production, and to fund risk management measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/28">We are also disappointed that the Health Check was unable to go further in achieving full decoupling across the EU (although that will be achieved in England), phasing out all the remaining market support mechanisms such as intervention, and focusing even more CAP spending on delivering public benefits, including environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/29">On balance, the UK could not support the final Health Check deal because it allows unused funding from single payment scheme budgets to be used to fund measures within national envelopes, rather than being returned to member states, thus increasing the potential for distortions, and because it creates short-term competitive distortions and uncertainty in the dairy sector from a range of measures, in particular differential changes to milk quotas, changes to rules on the butterfat content in milk (which is used as a reference for deciding dairy quotas) and two reviews of the quota phase-out process.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/30">Overall, the UK takes the view that the agreement reached on the Health Check is a step in the right direction of further reform, but is also a missed opportunity to speed up the process of change. We will continue to press for further steps for the benefit of farmers, consumers, taxpayers and the environment in the forthcoming EU Budget review, in which we want to see a more fundamental reassessment of the CAP.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/31">The Council also agreed the presidency compromise on the school fruit scheme, but it failed to secure a majority either way on the approval of Round-Up Ready II GM soya for use as food and feed. The Commission will now act on its own initiative to approve this use.</p>
	<p pid="b.60WS.2/32">Finally, the Netherlands and UK raised concerns about the European Parliament's proposed amendments to the pesticides package. These could have an adverse affect on the availability of pesticides and so agricultural activity, with no impact on public health. It was important that the Council held to its agreed position. A number of member states intervened in support, whilst the Commission said it supported the Council's common position, and not the Parliament's approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.66WS.1/1">The Office for Strategic Co-ordination of Health Research (OSCHR) was established 22 months ago following Sir David Cooksey's recommendations for better co-ordination of health research activities across the UK, and a stronger focus on translating basic science into improved care for NHS patients. Sir David's report &quot;A Review of UK Health Research Funding&quot; was published in December 2006. The first progress report from the chairman of OSCHR, Professor Sir John Bell, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-18">18 November 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.66WS.1/2">Sir John's report &quot;Office for Strategic Co-ordination of Health: Chairman's First Progress Report&quot; highlights the main elements of the combined approach that has been put in place by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) since the Cooksey review. This period has seen an unprecedented commitment to health research in terms of funding, infrastructure, research programmes and the volume of health research commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.66WS.1/3">The Government's single health research fund, which will soon top &pound;1.7 billion a year, is allocated by the Department of Health to the National Institute for Health Research in England, and by the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills to the Medical Research Council, which supports research throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.66WS.1/4">The progress report also announces that the Prime Minister has asked for a set of national ambitions for health research to be developed to build on the progress so far and encourage the translation of major research breakthroughs into new NHS treatments and services. The national ambitions will be developed independently of Government by the research funding bodies, under the auspices of OSCHR, in consultation with the academic community.</p>
	<p pid="b.66WS.1/5">A copy of the report has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, announced that the Government is making extra money available, totalling &pound;100 million in steady state, to meet the higher than expected demand for student support in 2009-10 and beyond. This will enable the Government to maintain its intention that two-thirds of eligible students should receive either the full grant of &pound;2,906 or a partial grant in 2009-10. We also expect that our commitment for one-third of eligible students to receive a full grant will be exceeded&mdash;under the new package, we anticipate that 40 per cent. of students may be eligible for a full grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/2">This means that students with household incomes ranging from &pound;18,360 to &pound;50,020 will be eligible for higher levels of grant than in 2007-08, while those with incomes ranging from &pound;18,360 to &pound;57,708 will be eligible for a more generous package of grant and loan support than in 2007-08. Amendment Regulations to the Education (Student Support) (No 2) Regulations 2008 are being laid today.</p>
	<p pid="b.72WS.1/3">My predecessor as Minister of State for Higher Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" name="Bill Rammell">the Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell)</phrase>, placed a Memorandum in the Library on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-13">13 May 2008</phrase> giving details of the increased loan, grant and fee rates for the 2009-10 academic year, in line with forecast price increases. The detailed tables in that memorandum gave income thresholds for the partial maintenance grant and for the non-means-tested element of the student loan, which have now been revised. I am therefore placing an updated memorandum in the Library which makes clear the levels of support available to new entrants in 2009-10, as well as giving tables showing support for continuing students.</p>

	<p pid="b.83WS.1/1">I am announcing today the publication of Delivering a Sustainable Transport System. This document marks the latest milestone in our longer term planning process, setting out our goals and identifying the various challenges that future transport schemes will need to address.</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/2">The publication of Towards a Sustainable Transport System in October 2007 outlined our approach to long-term transport planning. Since then the department has been undertaking further work and accelerating the process for identifying the strategic national corridors where we face our most immediate transport challenges. The National Networks Strategy Group I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-29">29 October</phrase> will be focusing on measures to ensure we make best use of investment in key strategic national corridors, and develop these for the longer term. The development of solutions for international networks will also be led by the department. Regions and local authorities will undertake similar work for the remaining networks.</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/3">Transport is a critical enabler for the economy and underpins many of the things we regard as important for our quality of life, but we are also committed to addressing climate change both now and for future generations.</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/4">A copy of the document has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/5">I am also announcing today that I am bringing forward over &pound;l billion of investment in improving our nation's transport infrastructure, in particular to tackle bottlenecks and improve access to key international gateways.</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/6">This comprises an extra &pound;700 million which will be invested in major transport projects next year to accelerate Government plans to cut congestion and significantly increase rail capacity. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/7" class="indent">dualling of the A46 between Newark and Widmerpool (&pound;100 million&mdash;as part of &pound;174 million Government funding overall)</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/8" class="indent">an additional 200 train carriages to relieve congestion on the Great Western, Northern and Transpennine rail franchises (&pound;300 million)</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/9" class="indent">introducing more managed motorways schemes to make best use of our existing motorway capacity (&pound;300 million).</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/10">Alongside this, &pound;300 million of new Government funding will be committed to speeding up the delivery of other key schemes that improve transport links to some of the UK's most important airports and ports, as well as offering more environmentally friendly options for transporting freight. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/11" class="indent">improvements to the A180-A160 junction to enhance access to Immingham Port (&pound;30 million)</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/12" class="indent">technology improvements to enhance traffic flow on the A12 between the M25 and Ipswich, improving access to Felixstowe and Harwich ports (&pound;60 million)</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/13" class="indent">the South East Manchester relief road, to improve access to Manchester Airport (&pound; 165 million)</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/14" class="indent">enhancements to the North London Line to enable increased movements of rail freight on this important link (&pound;54million).</p>
	<p pid="b.83WS.1/15">Delivery of the A46, A12, A180-A160 and access to Manchester Airport schemes is subject to agreeing regional funding contributions and, with the exception of the A12, the completion of statutory planning processes.</p>

	<p pid="b.86WS.1/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and I have today published the Government's response to Dame Carol Black's review of the health of Britain's working age population, &quot;Working for a healthier tomorrow&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/2">Dame Carol's review, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-17">17 March 2008</phrase>, built upon the growing evidence that work is generally good for health and that the mounting costs of ill-health are unacceptable, whether for individuals and families, for businesses or for society as a whole. Her analysis brought into focus, as never before, the scale of the economic cost of ill-health and its impact not just on work but on human life. She laid the foundation for a consensus around a new vision for health and work, setting out radical and far-reaching proposals to prevent illness; make early access to work-related health support available to all; and improve the health of the workless so that everyone with the potential to work has the support they need to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/3">Today we are responding in full to Dame Carol's recommendations. Our response &quot;Improving health and work: changing lives&quot; sets out our proposals. It includes a series of pilots and programmes with the potential to redefine the ambition of health and employment support in Britain; shifting the focus of welfare beyond helping people into work to helping them stay there; and further widening the focus of national healthcare from treatment to prevention and early intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/4">Our proposals include:</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/5" class="indent">Changing the paper based 'sick note' to an electronic 'fit note';</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/6" class="indent">Piloting a 'Fit for Work' service;</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/7" class="indent">Creating a National Centre for Working-Age Health and Well-being;</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/8" class="indent">Establishing a network of Health, Work and Well-being Co-ordinators;</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/9" class="indent">Introducing an occupational health helpline;</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/10" class="indent">Extending NHS Plus ;</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/11" class="indent">A review of the health and well-being of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/12">Dame Carol set out a challenging vision for improving the health of the working age population. Ultimately responsibility rests with a range of people: Government; employers; trades unions; healthcare professionals; and individuals themselves. Today, with the publication of our response we are setting out Government's real commitment to this agenda and how we will play our part.</p>
	<p pid="b.86WS.1/13">Copies of &quot;Improving Health and Work: Changing Lives&quot; will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
