<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-11-11.31WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/970" speakername="Geoff Hoon" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="31WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041111/wmstext/41111m01.htm#41111m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".31WS.2/1">) The UK places the utmost priority on protecting its citizens, whether at home or abroad. We are always prepared to deploy British forces to evacuate UK nationals should their lives be placed in jeopardy. In the light of the deteriorating security situation in C&ocirc;te D'Ivoire, a military reconnaissance team deployed earlier this week to assess the requirement to evacuate UK nationals. I wish to inform the House that, following this reconnaissance, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has requested British forces to undertake an evacuation of UK nationals and others over the next few days. Some 400 people are entitled to our protection.</p>
	<p pid=".31WS.2/2">While I cannot give the House precise details of the mission for reasons of operational security, we have now established liaison teams in Abidjan, and at Accra in Ghana. Concurrently, we have ordered the deployment of the Spearhead lead company group comprising Royal Gurkha Rifles personnel to assist with this evacuation. The company group is pre-positioning in Accra and will be on immediate notice to be called forward to support the evacuation in Abidjan. It is intended to support this evacuation with a number of RAF transport aircraft. In total this equates to a deployment of around 300 personnel.</p>
	<p pid=".31WS.2/3">As an additional contingency we have redirected the landing platform dock HMS Albion towards C&ocirc;te D'Ivoire, and reduced the notice to move for other force elements should they be required. We would expect the operation to last days, not weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".31WS.2/4">Our ability to react quickly to the situation on C&ocirc;te D'Ivoire is testament to the flexibility and capability of Britain's armed forces, and to the professionalism of British servicemen and women. The UK is working in close co-operation with international partners to monitor and respond to the situation in C&ocirc;te D'Ivoire as it develops. In particular, we are working with the French and Ghanaians, who have offered significant enabling support to British forces.</p>

	<p pid=".32WS.1/1">The contract for project Aquatrine package B, which covers the Ministry of Defence's estate in Scotland, has been awarded to Thames Water Nevis Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Thames Water whose major partner will be Scottish Water.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.1/2">Project Aquatrine is one of the Government's leading and most significant public-private partnership (PPP) projects and will transfer the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the Department's water and wastewater assets and infrastructure throughout Great Britain to private sector providers. This project will enable the transfer of environmental risk to those in the private sector who are best placed to manage it and enable the Ministry of Defence to focus on its core activities. It is a 25-year arrangement worth &pound;2.3billion across three packages that cover the MOD's estate in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.1/3">Following a pre-commencement period, Thames Water Nevis Ltd. in partnership with Scottish Water will commence services in March 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".36WS.7/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) inspection report on Eastbourne borough council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.7/2">Following the housing Green Paper &quot;Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All&quot;, published in April 2000, the Department for Work and Pensions developed a performance framework for housing benefits. The performance standards for housing benefits allow local authorities to make a comprehensive self-assessment of whether they deliver benefit effectively and securely. They are the standards that the Department for Work and Pensions expects local authorities to aspire to and achieve in time.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.7/3">In 2002&ndash;03, Eastbourne borough council administered some &pound;31.8 million in housing benefits, about 52 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.7/4">In April 2004 BFI carried out a second inspection of Eastbourne borough council and found that many of the issues highlighted in the 1999 inspection were still outstanding. For example, claims verification was still weak in some areas, there was a lack of management assurance checking, comprehensive guidance for staff was not available and the management of counter-fraud activity was poor. The review of the entire overpayments process that BFI recommended in 1999 had not been carried out.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.7/5">The report notes that performance in administering benefits does not meet key best value performance indicators, and management information is not analysed or used to manage processes or identify staff training requirements. Comprehensive policies relating to benefits are not in place and there has been no dedicated counter-fraud manager since August 2003, resulting in a lack of effective counter-fraud measures.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.7/6">The council's high level commitment to provide an effective benefits service is not adequately reflected in its operational planning and staff objectives. The organisational structure has also contributed to a lack of direction and effective communication within the service.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.7/7">The BFI reports that although the council has not reached standard in any of the seven performance standards, there are some areas of strength. There is support for the benefits service at a corporate level, and a new management structure that was put in place just before the on-site phase of the BFI inspection.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.7/8">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to further improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter-fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.7/9">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings and recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".37WS.1/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) inspection report on the London borough of Lambeth was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.1/2">Following the housing Green Paper &quot;Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All&quot;, published in April 2000, the Department for Work and Pensions developed a performance framework for housing benefits. The performance standards for housing benefits allow local authorities to make a comprehensive self-assessment of whether they deliver benefit effectively and securely. They are the standards that the Department for Work and Pensions expects local authorities to aspire to and achieve in time.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.1/3">In 2003&ndash;04, the London Borough of Lambeth administered some &pound;114.9 million in housing benefits, about 10.37 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.1/4">In May 2004 BFI carried out a follow-up inspection on the London Borough of Lambeth assessing progress against the recommendations from the first inspection report published in 2001. The report notes that the council has not reached standard in any of the seven performance standards. There are some good practices in strategic areas, including a clear corporate vision, underpinned by policies and high level plans. Overpayment recovery has also improved and is supported by good procedural guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.1/5">However, the council's corporate commitment to provide an effective benefits service is not followed through into operational planning, staff objectives or local targets. The organisational structure does not support the effective delivery of benefits or effective communication. Performance in administering benefits remains poor, does not meet best value performance indicators and is hampered by the continuing backlog of work.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.1/6">BFI reports that the counter-fraud policies have led to a number of successful sanctions and prosecutions but numbers of referrals from the benefits service are falling, management controls are inadequate and communications between benefits and investigation staff are poor.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.1/7">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to further improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter-fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".37WS.1/8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings and recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".38WS.1/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the benefit fraud inspectorate (BFI) inspection report on Swale borough council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/2">Following the housing Green Paper &quot;Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All&quot;, published in April 2000, the Department for Work and Pensions developed a performance framework for housing benefits. The performance standards for housing benefits allow local authorities to make a comprehensive self-assessment of whether they deliver benefit effectively and securely. They are the standards that the Department for Work and Pensions expects local authorities to aspire to and achieve in time.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/3">In 2003&ndash;04, Swale borough council administered some &pound;29.1 million in housing benefits, about 48 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/4">In June 2004 BFI carried out a third inspection on Swale borough council and found that the council's benefits service had failed to fully implement 56 per cent. of the recommendations made in the second inspection report, published in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/5">The report notes that the council has not reached standard in any of the seven performance standards. The council did not monitor performance and the lack of reliable management information undermined the council's ability to effectively manage its benefits service and counter-fraud activity.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/6">The council averaged 168 days to process new claims, and 66 days to process changes of circumstances, compared with performance standards of 36 and nine days respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/7">BFI reports that nearly 25 per cent. of telephone calls to the benefits service were unanswered. Decision letters needed to give clearer guidance and information to customers. There were delays in dealing with complaints and replies frequently did not cover the facts, were misleading and lacked sufficient detail.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/8">The management of the council's counter-fraud resources and quality of the investigative work was poor. Delays in dealing with changes of circumstances increased the level of preventable overpayments. Between March 2003 and March 2004, outstanding debt increased by 95 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/9">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to further improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter-fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".38WS.1/10">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the BFFs findings and recommendations.</p>
