	<p pid="a.47WS.2/1">Further to the answer I gave <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February 2008</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-02-18.381"><i>Official Report</i>, column 381W</phrase>, we said that the costs incurred in setting up the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform were &pound;218,063. These costs included stationery, rebranding and IT changes, including revised email addresses, new signage, web-based changes, new logo and print costs and the anticipated cost of branding guidelines. This figure is also quoted in my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">26 November 2007</phrase>, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase>. A copy of this letter was placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.2/2">Those costs included an estimate of &pound;24,000 for the costs of producing branding guidelines, which had not been completed at the time. These branding guidelines have subsequently been completed: the final costs were &pound;20,000. Therefore, the final total costs are &pound;214,063.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" name="Gareth Thomas">the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas)</phrase>, Kim Darroch (UK Permanent Representative to the EU) and I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.8/2">The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.47WS.8/11">The Council adopted conclusions that welcomed Serbian voters' strong support for pro-European parties at the <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-11">11 May</phrase> elections; hoped that the new Government would engage constructively with the EU in advancing Serbia towards candidate status, by meeting the necessary conditions; and looked forward to the signature of Bosnia and Herzegovina's stabilisation and association agreement at the June GAERC.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.8/12">I said that if a pro-European Government were formed in Serbia, we would clearly want to sustain our commitment to that country's European path. But we would also need to be clear about our expectations of that Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.8/13" class="italic">Somalia</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.8/14">The Government agreed Council conclusions expressing the EU's concern at the security situation in Somalia, in particular its impact on human rights and humanitarian relief efforts; calling upon all parties to refrain from violence and seek to resolve conflict through the political process; welcoming the Transitional Federal Government's moves towards reconciliation with its domestic and external opponents; supporting the work of the UN and the African Union mission to Somalia (AMISOM); and condemning instances of piracy off the Somali coast.</p>

	<p pid="a.47WS.8/19">On the MEPP, Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the EU's commitment to the Annapolis process; expressed concern at Israeli settlement activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territories; condemned the firing of rockets into Israel from Gaza; and called upon Israel to ease restrictions on movement and access in the West Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.47WS.8/20">The Government welcome these conclusions, and in particular Ministers' decision to expand the EU police training mission (EUPOL COPPS) in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>

	<p pid="a.47WS.8/33">I emphasised the need for closer EU-NATO cooperation on the ground, and for the Paris conference on Afghanistan to deliver, along with a commitment from the Afghan Government to take responsibility for its own development, a commitment from the international community that it would support this by delivering assistance in support of the Afghan Government's national development strategy.</p>
