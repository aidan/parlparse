<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-01-24a.49WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for International Development" colnum="49WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/wmstext/60124m01.htm#60124m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/1">I visited Ethiopia on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January</phrase> and met Prime Minister Meles, leaders of the Opposition, family members of detainees and international NGOs in Addis Ababa. I expressed our deep concern over recent political events and told the Prime Minister that the UK will not at present provide general budget support to Ethiopia under current circumstances. This is because the provision of budget support is based upon shared commitments between partners, one of which is upholding human rights. Recent political events represent a breach of trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/2">All donors who have been giving budget support have now reached the same conclusion to withhold this form of support in the current circumstances and wrote to the Minister of Finance in December of last year to explain the decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/3">However, the UK remains committed to supporting poor people in Ethiopia in their fight against poverty. Ethiopia is desperately poor and already receives less aid per head than any other country in sub-Saharan Africa. It would be wrong therefore to reduce our aid programme, and thereby punish the poor in Ethiopia for recent political events in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/4">We are therefore working with other donors and the Government to try to design a new mechanism for providing funds in a more transparent and accountable way. This is so that basic services such as health, education and water can continue to be provided throughout the country and that we can be sure that aid is reaching those in need. We are also looking at providing additional assistance to the Productive Safety Nets Programme. This is a programme which the UK is already supporting and which, as I was able to see for myself in Ethiopia, is enabling the poorest to earn or receive small amounts of money to invest in assets like clothes, chicken and goats and for communities to improve their conditions, for example by building roads, water springs and classrooms.</p>

	<p pid="a.53WS.5/1">I have today laid copies of the Disability Rights Commission's (DRC's) draft Code of Practice on the provision and use of transport vehicles before the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/2">The Code, which has been developed in consultation with major stakeholders including industry representatives and the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee and been subject to public consultation, is a supplement to the DRC's existing Code of Practice: Rights of Access to Services and Premises for all other service providers, and it is intended to be read in conjunction with that publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/3">It is designed to assist the operators of rail vehicles (including light rail, underground and trams), buses, coaches, taxis, private hire vehicles, vehicle hire, breakdown services and vehicles used on leisure and tourism transport services in meeting their new duties under Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 as amended by the DDA 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/4">The new duties, which stem from the Disability Discrimination (Transport Vehicles) Regulations 2005, will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/5">When the regulations are in force, disabled people will have certain rights to transport services in the same way as they do to other services such as shops and banks.</p>
