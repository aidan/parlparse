	<p pid="a.9WS.2/1">The Department for Constitutional Affairs will be taking forward proposals and legislation on reform of the House of Lords, electoral administration, criminal defence services, the coroner system, reform of legal services, and compensation in the forthcoming session.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/2">We have today introduced, in the other place, the Criminal Defence Bill. This Bill contributes to bringing criminal legal aid expenditure under better control, by allowing for means testing to ensure those who can pay for their criminal defence do so, however providing that they will normally be reimbursed where acquitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/3">This Session, we will introduce, in draft, a Bill for the better regulation of the legal profession and those who provide legal services.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/4">We will introduce a Compensation Bill to clarify that there should be claims only where there is blame, and by regulating claims farmers to ensure they uphold high standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/5">The Electoral Administration Bill will establish new measures to increase security. It will also introduce measures to make elections more accessible to all members of our society and give new powers to returning officers enabling them to deliver elections and electoral services more efficiently and effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.9WS.2/6">The Government will bring forward measures to reform the House of Lords including: a Committee of both Houses to identify and set out the key conventions of the House of Lords; a reasonable time limit for Bills to proceed through the second chamber; removal of the remaining hereditary peers; and a free vote on the composition of the House.</p>

Given that we do not expect Second Reading of the Bill to take place until after the Whitsun recess, we have decided to extend the period for comment by three weeks, to <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-10">10 June</phrase>, to give people a further opportunity to offer views on the ES.</p>
