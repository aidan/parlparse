<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-12a.63WS.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="63WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070712/wmstext/70712m0001.htm#07071262000203">
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/1">The month of June was the wettest June on record; in excess of 150mm of rain fell over most of the Midlands and northern England with between 200 and 300mm in parts of the North East. These extreme conditions led to large scale urban flooding, a lot of which was from surface water run-off rather than from rivers. The flooding affected places across the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside, and tragically four people lost their lives as a direct result of the flooding. The circumstances of three other reported deaths are still being investigated. Over 37,000 properties including some 7,000 businesses are reported to have been affected, with nearly 18,000 properties affected in the Hull area alone and over 5,000 in the Doncaster area. It is estimated that thousands of people are still out of their homes with around 300 in emergency accommodation in Sheffield and Doncaster, and Hull. The response of the emergency services, local authorities, operating authorities, voluntary sector and the affected communities has been very impressive.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/2">However, as the affected communities, businesses and individuals move to the long and difficult task of recovery, they are understandably asking questions about the flooding&mdash;its causes and subsequent management. My ministerial colleagues and I have said that it is vital that we learn lessons now about how to manage and respond to this type of disaster in the future. As part of the usual process following an emergency we are establishing a review to identify these lessons, and the Prime Minister stated on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-08">8 July</phrase> that the conclusions of such an exercise would be made public. I am, therefore, announcing today how the Government intend to go about this and our aim to publish initial findings by the end of the year and subsequently a formal Government report. The review will be led by officials from the Cabinet Office with my officials' support. They will report to me, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/3">The review will look at flood risk management, the emergency response and the initial moves towards recovery. The longer-term recovery effort will require sustained commitment over a considerable period of time, and a further review will be undertaken separately once these tasks are well in hand and we are better able to assess the lessons to be drawn from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/4">The review will consider all available evidence on the flooding and its impacts and what this means for the future. It's specific objectives will be;</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/5" class="indent">i. To understand why the flooding was so extensive;</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/6" class="indent">ii. To learn lessons on how in future we can best predict, prevent or mitigate the scale and impact of flooding incidents;</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/7" class="indent">iii. To look at how best to co-ordinate the response to flooding in future;</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/8" class="indent">iv. To establish what access to support, equipment and information is needed by those involved in the response at local, regional and national levels;</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/9" class="indent">v. To ensure the public has as much access as possible to information on the risk of flooding to allow them to take appropriate precautions, be adequately informed on developments as an emergency unfolds, and be looked after properly in the immediate aftermath;</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/10" class="indent">vi. To establish how the transition from response to recovery is best managed;</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/11" class="indent">vii. To identify those aspects of the response that worked well and should be promoted and reinforced;</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/12" class="indent">viii. To make recommendations in each of these areas to improve the UK's preparedness for flooding events in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.7/13">The lessons learned exercise will be wide ranging and will hear from those involved at the local, regional and national level. It will ensure a structured approach to public engagement so that the voices of local communities are heard, including affected individuals and locally elected representatives (councillors and local MPs). At the same time I recognise that a considerable amount of work is taking place dealing with the recovery from last month's events&mdash;the review will therefore take place in a staged approach. It will identify areas for attention as quickly as possible with fuller responses over a slightly longer timescale. We aim to summarise initial findings of the review by the end of the year and explore more fully how we propose to address them in a subsequent published report.</p>

	<p pid="a.64WS.1/1">The unprecedented wet weather has caused significant disruption for a number of farmers. In recent days, including during my visit to the Great Yorkshire show, I have received representations from industry representatives and individual farmers about two specific measures we might take to help alleviate their difficulties. Both have now been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/2">Given the urgency of the issue, I gave instructions yesterday that the cross compliance requirement (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 3) prohibiting the use of mechanical field operations and mechanised vehicles on waterlogged soil should be suspended until <phrase class="date" code="">31 July 2007</phrase>. This will enable farmers to use mechanical equipment and vehicles on waterlogged soil and access their crops. Farmers should use their soil protection review as a means to identify and mitigate any soil-related issues arising as a result of the suspension.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/3">Livestock farmers have also been experiencing problems in accessing sufficient forage for their animals. I have, therefore, authorised the rural payments agency (RPA) to allow farmers in England to graze set-aside land with their own animals or harvest hay or silage for their own use. Farmers wishing to make use of this derogation should telephone, e-mail or write to the RPA customer service centre providing the reference numbers for the fields which they wish to graze or harvest. Exceptionally, in these circumstances, farmers may consider that the derogation has been granted unless RPA subsequently makes contact to indicate otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/4">Further details of these measures are accessible on the RPA website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.64WS.1/5"><a href="http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/839744302B8BBA1080257315005078F1">http://www.rpa.gov.uk/rpa/index.nsf/0/839744302B8BBA1080257315005078F1</a></p>

	<p pid="a.65WS.2/1">Following the end of the first round of recruitment for specialty training on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase>, I should like to give to the House the data that shows the number of posts that have been filled in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.65WS.2/2">The information is in the tables. These figures show that 85 per cent. of all junior doctor training posts in England have been filled by the end of round one. Of a total of 15,600 training posts available in England, 13,168 have been offered to and accepted by junior doctors.</p>
	<p pid="a.65WS.2/3">A second round of recruitment has commenced and will run until <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>. Deaneries have informed the Department that there are 2,320 posts available to applicants within Round Two.</p>
	<p pid="a.65WS.2/4">As part of the package announced in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-24">24 May</phrase> there will also be around 1,000 training posts made available at the end of this year's recruitment process to appointable junior doctors who did not secure a post in Rounds One or Two.</p>

They assessed the centre's development as poor.</p>

	<p pid="a.69WS.1/3">The inspections confirmed concerns raised by the Youth Justice Board regarding levels of order and control at the centre. The CSCI reports will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.1/4">The Youth Justice Board has required Mr. Stevens to set out how he would improve performance at the centre, which is operated by G4S.</p>
	<p pid="a.69WS.1/5">The Youth Justice Board will monitor performance closely and expects to see rapid progress. If this is not the case further action will be taken and in this event I will update the House.</p>
