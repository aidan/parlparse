	<p pid="a.13WS.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-11">Monday 11 April 2011</phrase>, we confirmed continued financial support rising to &#163;10.1 million by 2014-15 for four local authority social care PFI projects in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.8/2">Following the spending review in October 2010, which transferred responsibility for PFI schemes to sponsor Departments, the Department of Health undertook a full review of the affordability of the social care PFI scheme and the quality of the proposals that had bid for support. This is in line with the cross-Government reassessment of PFI schemes to ensure they do not create an unaffordable burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.8/3">The projects to receive PFI credits are based in Leeds, Hull, Sandwell and Hammersmith. They will all provide community social care and health facilities for vulnerable people. These projects were among 17 that the Department reviewed. The criteria for the review were: available funding, deliverability and minimising waste-giving priority to those projects already in procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.8/4">The Government will look to the local authorities whose projects were unsuccessful to give priority to them as front-line services or to look at other ways of providing these services.</p>

	<p pid="a.15WS.2/1">I regret to inform the House that there was an inaccuracy in my written answer (45254) given on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-14">14 March 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-03-14.97"><i>Official Report</i>, column 97W</phrase>, about assessment of the effects on competition in the railway industry of the acquisition of Arriva Trains by Deutsche Bahn. The correct answer is that the European Commission carried out an assessment of the Deutsche Bahn acquisition of Arriva plc in 2010. A copy of the European Commission's assessment of the effects can be viewed on their website.</p>
