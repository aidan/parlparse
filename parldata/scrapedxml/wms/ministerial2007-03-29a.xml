	High Leaseholder Major Works Bills
</minor-heading>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-29a.118WS.2" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-29b.118WS.2" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-29a.118WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning" colnum="118WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070329/wmstext/70329m0001.htm#07032949000696">
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/1">This statement reports progress on the Government's review of the complex issues raised by the high major works bills now faced by some owners of ex-council flats ('leaseholders'). It sets out progress and further steps that the Government will take to address these issues, while looking for other sustainable solutions in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/2" class="italic">Background</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/3">Tenants who buy flats from local authorities, and people who buy flats formerly owned by local authorities, are responsible for contributing towards the cost of repairing, maintaining and improving the properties in which those flats are situated.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/4">Some current works of repair, maintenance and improvement to local authority properties are generating high major works bills, particularly in London. We have commissioned research into the impact on leaseholders, and have published the results on our website, at: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp">http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp</a>?id:=l504262</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/5">.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/6" class="italic">The Government's Review</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/7">We recognise that substantial major works bills may cause difficulties for some leaseholders and have consulted widely on the implications with all the stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/8">Our review has mainly focused on the range of ways in which local authorities can help leaseholders to pay their bills. It has also considered how landlords currently communicate with leaseholders on scheduled major works and their costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/9" class="italic">Capping of Service Charges</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/10">Leaseholders do not always have to pay the full amount that their lease requires. Major works charges are capped to no more than &pound;10,000 in any five-year period when the works are funded by specified Government grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/11" class="italic">Ways of Helping Leaseholders Pay Their Bills</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/12">Local authorities can already help leaseholders to pay their bills in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/13" class="indent">They may reduce bills to no more than &pound;10,000 in any five-year period if the leaseholder would not benefit from the works financially or would face exceptional hardship in paying it.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/14" class="indent">They must offer loans to leaseholders who have bought their flats under the right-to-buy scheme, if they apply within a specified time, and they may give loans to leaseholders under other circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/15" class="indent">They may allow leaseholders to pay their bills by monthly instalments and over an extended period, or defer payment until the property is sold.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/16" class="indent">They can buy back properties from owners who are in financial difficulties. When doing so, they receive financial I assistance from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/17">Some local authorities offer leaseholders the HouseProud equity release scheme managed by the Home Improvement Trust. A number of lenders also offer other equity release products that can be tailored to people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/18">Taken together, these offer leaseholders a wide range of options. But we have found that these are not all available in all areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/19" class="italic">What the Government Will Do</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/20">We think more can be done in the short term to help leaseholders to deal with high major works bills by means of these existing options, with enhancements and additions in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/21">But the alternative of simply extending the existing scheme for capping bills would bring severe problems. Capping all major works bills to &pound;10,000 while taking no account of ability to pay would be very expensive&mdash;in London, this could, on current figures, cost more than &pound;40 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/22">But we recognise that there may be people whose financial resources are so squeezed that more targeted action may be needed. So we will do the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/23">We will make it clear to local authorities that they should:</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/24" class="indent">i. inform and advise all leaseholders who face particularly high major works bills about the available payment options;</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/25" class="indent">ii. offer the full range of available payment options to help leaseholders pay their bills, and share best practice to ensure that this happens everywhere;</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/26" class="indent">iii. use existing resources, such as for private sector renewal which they are already expected to target towards those in need and on low incomes, to assist leaseholders in hardship;</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/27" class="indent">we have in addition increased funding for LEASE so that social sector leaseholders can obtain authoritative advice and help at an early stage and LEASE can expand its alternative dispute resolution and mediation role in respect of social sector service charge disputes that arise;</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/28" class="indent">we will work urgently with lenders and independent financial advisers, landlords and leaseholder representatives to develop the use of existing equity release/equity loan schemes (including 'HouseProud');</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/29" class="indent">in the longer term, we intend to legislate to enable local authorities to offer equity loans to leaseholders, and to buy back shares in properties so that leaseholders in difficulties do not have to revert to being tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.118WS.2/30">We are continuing to look further at ways to address this complex and sensitive issue. These actions represent work in progress. We will also actively monitor developments, to ensure that all concerned focus on the best ways of tackling these issues both now and in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.120WS.4/1">My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton) has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.120WS.4/2" class="indent">&quot;The following list of Key Performance Indicators have been set for Her Majesty's Courts Service for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.120WS.4/3" class="indent">1. Improve the percentage of defendants' cases that commence within a specific time in the Crown Court, so that:</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-29a.121WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1472" speakername="Harriet Harman" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs" colnum="121WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070329/wmstext/70329m0002.htm#07032949000699">
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following statement to the House about the inquests of servicemen and women who have died overseas which fall within the jurisdiction of the Oxfordshire coroner, Nicholas Gardiner.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/2">All casualties suffered by the UK armed forces are a source of profound regret. UK service personnel have put their lives on the line to help build strong, stable and democratic nations and protect the interests of the United Kingdom and we cannot pay high enough tribute to the job they are doing, or the sacrifice some of them have made. We are committed to assisting the families of UK Service personnel who have died on operations overseas when their loved ones are returned to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/3">We made statements to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-12">12 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-18">18 December</phrase> with information about the conduct of inquests by the Oxfordshire coroner and today we are announcing progress which has been made since the written ministerial statement in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/4" class="italic">Background</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/5">Coroners are independent judicial officers appointed and paid for by the relevant local authority. Their officers and staff are employed by the local authority and/or the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/6">Each death of a serviceman or woman killed in an operation overseas whose body is repatriated to England and Wales is subject to an inquest. The inquest &mdash; both the investigation into the death and the holding of the public hearing into the death &mdash; is conducted by the coroner with jurisdiction which derives from where the body lies. In the case of deaths of servicemen and women whose bodies are flown into Brize Norton military airbase, the Oxfordshire coroner has jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/7">In the 12 months preceding the June written ministerial statement, in addition to the non-armed forces inquests which the coroner has in his jurisdiction, Mr Gardiner and his deputy coroners had conducted 31 inquests into the deaths of servicemen who died in Iraq. One inquest was dealt with by the Powys coroner and one by the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/8">At the time of the <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase> written ministerial statement, there remained 59 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel killed in Iraq and 11 inquests of civilians whose bodies were flown into Brize Norton.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/9">At the time of the 12<sup>( )</sup>October written ministerial statement, a further nine inquests had been held into the deaths of servicemen who have died in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/10">When I made the written ministerial statement in June, we had only asked the coroner to provide details of inquests into those deaths in his jurisdiction relating to Iraq. By the time of the October statement the coroner had provided us with details of outstanding inquests into six deaths from previous conflicts or other military exercises abroad and three further civilian casualties, the earliest of which occurred in 1998. The position in relation to the inquests in these additional deaths was reported to the House in the <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-12">12 October</phrase> statement. Including these deaths, there remained 59 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel and 11 inquests into the deaths of civilians at the time of the October statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/11">By the time of the December written ministerial statement, the coroner had provided us with details of outstanding inquests into six deaths from a military exercise in the Czech Republic in 2004. Including these deaths, there remained 48 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel and nine inquests into the deaths of civilians who lost their lives in Iraq and whose bodies were repatriated to RAF Brize Norton.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/12">As of today, there remain 25 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel in military conflicts and exercises overseas whose bodies were repatriated to RAF Brize Norton and 4 inquests into the deaths of civilians who lost their lives in Iraq and whose bodies were repatriated to RAF Brize Norton.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/13" class="italic">Further support for the coroner to conduct inquests on deceased armed forces personnel</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/14">As we reported to the House in the earlier statements, the Oxfordshire coroner appointed the following as additional assistant deputy coroners to assist with conducting the inquests detailed above:</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/15"><i>Sir Richard Curtis&mdash;</i>who served as a High Court Judge between 1992 and 2005, was appointed on<phrase class="date" code="2007-08-08">8 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/16"><i>Ms. Selena Lynch&mdash;</i>barrister at law, former full-time Coroner for Inner South London and currently deputy coroner for South London was appointed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/17"><i>Mr. Andrew Walker&mdash;</i>barrister at law, Deputy Coroner for both North London and East London and Assistant Deputy Coroner for both Inner London North and Inner London South was appointed on<phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/18">To provide support for the coroner and his assistant deputy coroners, the following resources have been made available:</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/19"><i>Three additional coroner's officers, Mr. Geoff Webb, Mr. George Gatt and Mr. Derrick Bines</i> have been appointed by Thames Valley Police to support the existing complement of five officers and one officer's team leader in the Oxfordshire coroner's office. They are supporting the coroners in various ways, including by contacting witnesses, listing inquests and providing support at inquests.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/20"><i>An additional administrative assistant, Ms. Stella Hartley-Morris </i>has been appointed to the existing administrative assistant in the Oxfordshire coroner's office who provide administrative support for the investigations and inquests.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/21"><i>Recording equipment&mdash;</i>to enable two courts to operate simultaneously.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/22" class="italic">Progress with the remaining inquests</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/23">At the time of the December written ministerial statement, all inquests of deaths had been allocated to the assistant deputy coroners. 19 inquests had been held (the WMS mistakenly stated 18 inquests) the inquest into the death of Sergeant Roberts was currently being held and a further 50 inquests had been listed for hearing (the WMS mistakenly reported 51 inquests).</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/24">The position now is that 56 inquests have been held, 46 into the deaths of servicemen and 10 into the deaths of civilians. All of the remaining 25 inquests into servicemen's deaths have been listed for hearing and pre-inquest hearings have been set in the remaining four civilian inquests. We hope that all the inquests will have been heard by the end of June. We are very grateful for the efforts of all those involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/25">We shall continue to keep the House informed on a quarterly basis about progress through the remaining inquests. Below is a table, which outlines the status of all cases and the date of death of each case.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/26">We have not included in this statement inquests into a further 66 service personnel deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan which occurred after <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">15 May 2006</phrase> and which were repatriated into Brize Norton, as the additional support for the coroner outlined above only intended to clear the backlog of cases he had in June. 16 of these cases have been dispersed to other coroners but there remain 50 inquests where the Oxfordshire coroner has retained jurisdiction which have been opened and adjourned.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/27">Resources have now been made available to the Oxfordshire Coroner to enable Andrew Walker to remain as assistant deputy coroner with Geoff Webb as coroner's officer to complete those inquests where the Oxfordshire coroner assumed responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/28" class="italic">Liaison with the next of kin</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/29">It is of the greatest importance that the next of kin have full information about the progress on the inquest of their deceased next of kin.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/30">In order to further improve the service to families I invited to meet me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase> the families of service personnel who died in Iraq whose inquests had been held. We are grateful to the 17 relatives of the 12 deceased servicemen and women who gave us the benefit of their views and experiences so as to improve the inquest system for the benefit of future families of members of the armed service who die abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.121WS.1/31">Following that meeting we are working on providing families with better information about the inquest system, how we can help families to have access to all material relevant to the inquest; and holding inquests closer to where the relatives live.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-29a.130WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs" colnum="130WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070329/wmstext/70329m0003.htm#07032949000700">
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/1">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, my right hon. Friend Baroness Ashton of Upholland has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/2" class="indent">The Government are today publishing a supplementary paper to the consultation paper on the draft Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2007, which would give effect to the changes the Government announced it was minded to make on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/3" class="indent">Following the recent consultation of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December 2006</phrase> the Government are issuing this supplementary paper to consult on the principle of amending the 2004 regulations, specifically whether the 2004 regulations should be amended to deal with the identified problem of requests which are disproportionately burdensome on public authority resources. Further comments on the draft regulations contained in the consultation paper of<phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December 2006</phrase> are also welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/4" class="indent">The draft regulations would extend the existing provisions by allowing public authorities to:</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/5" class="indent">include reading time, consideration time and consultation time in the calculation of the appropriate limit above which requests could be refused on cost grounds; and</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/6" class="indent">aggregate all requests made by a person (or persons apparently acting in concert or pursuance of a campaign) to each public authority within a period of 60 working days for the purposes of calculating the appropriate limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/7" class="indent">An independent economic review of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act commissioned by my Department and published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October 2006</phrase> found that a small percentage of requests and requestors were placing disproportionately large burdens on public authorities in terms of the costs of officials' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/8" class="indent">While the Government believe it is entirely right that a reasonable amount of resource is spent dealing with requests for information, it is also necessary to consider, in light of experience, whether the existing provisions need to be amended in order to provide the right balance between access to information for all and the delivery of other public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.130WS.1/9" class="indent">The supplementary paper is published today, with responses being invited by <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June 2007</phrase>. The paper will be sent to key stakeholders and all responders to the consultation published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December 2006</phrase>. Both papers are available on my Department's website at: <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk">www.dca.gov.uk</a> and will be available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.135WS.2/1">My<i></i>right hon. And learned Friend the Attorney General has made the following written ministerial statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/2">&quot;I<i></i>am today arranging for the publication of research commissioned by the Office of Criminal Justice Reform from IPSOS MORI on public attitudes to alternatives to prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/3">The research, conducted during March 2006, involved interviews with 1,027 people aged 15 and over in England and Wales and four focus groups. There were also six focus groups with victims and witnesses to test their views of out of court penalties for adults and youths. The research was commissioned as part of a review of out of court penalties which I have been leading.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/4">Whilst the research has been available to criminal justice practitioners since last June, we are now putting it into the public domain because of the general interest in its existence. The findings show that:</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/5" class="indent">Nine out of 10 participants think that first time minor criminal offences need not necessarily be dealt with by the courts;</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/6" class="indent">Half of those participants think a caution or reprimand would be the most appropriate disposal;</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/7" class="indent">Six out of 10 participants think that second minor offences (that this is after a FPN or warning has been given) could be dealt with out of the courts;</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/8" class="indent">A quarter of participants think the best way to deal with second minor offences is by a caution with conditions attached, such as compensation or making amends;</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/9" class="indent">A 44 per cent. majority of participants felt the most appropriate way to deal with offenders who own up to minor offences was for them to make amends to the victim, for example by compensation or an apology.</p>
	<p pid="a.135WS.2/10" class="indent">I am placing copies of the material in the Libraries of both Houses.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.138WS.1/1">I have today agreed to the publishing of the Insolvency Service's Corporate Plan for the period 2007-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.138WS.1/2">The Insolvency Service plans to deal with some 77,000 new insolvencies in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>, principally as a result of a further increase in personal bankruptcies.</p>
	<p pid="a.138WS.1/3">Its planning assumption for the level of redundancy payments and other insolvency-related claims is 90,000 in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.138WS.1/4">Action will continue to be taken against bankrupts and company directors in respect of financial misconduct or dishonesty and I have asked the service to increase its enforcement output by 7 per cent. over that achieved in 2006-07. Companies Investigation Branch will continue to investigate the affairs of companies in the public interest and I have set targets in relation to the timeliness of dealing with complaints made and the handling of investigations that follow from those complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.138WS.1/5">The service's &quot;Enabling the Future&quot; strategy, a major programme of IT led investment, will deliver savings over the period of the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review and I have therefore set the service a target to have reduced its case administration fees by 15 per cent. by <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.138WS.1/6">The Corporate Plan is available at: <a href="http://www.insolvency.aov.uk">www.insolvency.aov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.138WS.1/7">I have also set the Insolvency Service the following targets for the year 2007-08:</p>
