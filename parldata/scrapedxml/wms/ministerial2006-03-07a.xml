<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-07a.55WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1800" speakername="Shaun Woodward" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland" colnum="55WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/wmstext/60307m01.htm#60307m01.html_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.55WS.1/1">This statement announces that, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase>, I launched an eight-week public consultation exercise on the draft Smoking (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 (the draft Order). In my previous statement to the House, on <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>, I announced my intention to introduce comprehensive measures to protect all workers and the public from the dangers of passive smoking and second-hand smoke in workplaces and in all enclosed public places in Northern Ireland, including all pubs and all bars. The draft Order represents the next stage in this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.1/2">As I made clear in my previous statement, there is strong public support in Northern Ireland for comprehensive controls on tobacco use. Questions about strengthening existing controls on tobacco use elicited 70,823 responses of which 91.18 per cent. supported comprehensive controls similar to those already in place in the Republic of Ireland and due to be introduced in Scotland later this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.1/3">The draft Order, Explanatory Memorandum, Integrated Impact Assessment Overview&mdash;incorporating a Regulatory Impact Assessment&mdash;and a structured questionnaire will be distributed to a wide range of interests across Northern Ireland and will also be made available on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.55WS.1/4">The draft Order makes provision for enclosed or substantially enclosed premises to be smoke-free; provides for the Department to make regulations to exempt certain premises, or parts of premises, under certain conditions (this does not include licensed premises); gives the Department the power to designate other places (which need not be enclosed or substantially enclosed) as smoke-free; enables the Department to make regulations to provide for vehicles to be smoke-free; creates a duty to display no-smoking signs; sets out offences and penalties for failure to display signs, smoking in a smoke-free place and failing to prevent smoking in a smoke-free place; and gives the Department the power to make regulations to change the age (but not lower than 16) of young persons to whom tobacco may be sold.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-07a.56WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" speakername="James Plaskitt" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions" colnum="56WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/wmstext/60307m02.htm#60307m02.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will be held on <phrase class="date" code="">10 March</phrase> in Brussels. There are no health or consumer affairs issues. I shall be representing the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/2">The first and main item is the Preparation for the Spring European Council which will be held on the <phrase class="date" code="">24 March 2006</phrase>. The &quot;Key Messages&quot; paper presented by the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee identifies the key messages emerging from the numerous other reports for adoption and endorsement at this March Council. The presidency has posed two questions to help focus the discussion. The first question is on the role of the social partners in strengthening the Lisbon process and the second question is on the progress made with social protection and social inclusion. The &quot;Key Messages&quot; paper will be adopted following a policy debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/3">The second item is an exchange of views on the Preparation for the Tripartite Social Summit. This will be held on <phrase class="date" code="">23 March</phrase> in advance of the Spring European Council to allow the European Social Partners leave to feed in their views to the Spring Council. It consists of the current presidency, the two subsequent presidencies (Finland and Germany), the Commission and the social partners. It meets at least once a year, including before each annual Spring Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/4">The Committee Chairs will provide information on the work programmes of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee for 2006. The Council is annually informed about the Committees' work programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/5">The Council will reach general agreement on Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 (Miscellaneous amendments 2005). This is a regular update of the regulation which coordinates social security within the European Union. It is tabled for general approach as the European Parliament has not yet had their first reading of the dossier.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/6">The final agenda item will be a Commission presentation on the report on Transitional Arrangements set out in 2003 Accession Treaty. These are the measures allowing member states to restrict, for a transitional period, free movement of workers from eight of the new member states. The UK has opened up its labour market and has a Worker Registration Scheme. Some member states may intervene to discuss free movement of workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.2/7">Under &quot;Any Other Business&quot; there is a Commission presentation on the &quot;Roadmap&quot; for Gender Equality and on a proposal for a Regulation establishing the European Globalisation Fund. There are three written items on presidency conferences: &quot;Demographic Challenges&mdash;Family Needs Partnership&quot;, &quot;Innovations in Labour Market Policies&mdash;Challenges in Times of Globalisation&quot; and &quot;Joint Action of Member States against Harmful Traditional Practices&quot;. I do not expect any debate on these items.</p>
