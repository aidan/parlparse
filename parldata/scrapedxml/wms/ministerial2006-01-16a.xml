	<p pid="a.22WS.1/1">On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on South Northamptonshire Council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/2">In 2004&ndash;05 South Northamptonshire Council administered some &pound;8.7 million in housing benefits, about 20 per cent. of its gross revenue expenditure. The inspection focused on the council's arrangements for processing claims, as it was taking an average of 104 days to process new claims for housing benefit in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/3">BFI found that the council's performance in processing new claims had significantly improved. The average time taken had reduced from 104 days in 2003&ndash;04 to 81.5 days in 2004&ndash;05, and 43.5 days in the first quarter of 2005&ndash;06. While this remained longer than the Department's Standard of 36 days, there had clearly been a considerable improvement in the council's performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/4">The inspection revealed a similar situation in the time taken to process changes of circumstances, which had improved from an average of 44 days in 2003&ndash;04, to 19.7 days in 2004&ndash;05, and 18.7 days in the first quarter of 2005&ndash;06. Again, this performance was below the Department's Standard of nine days, but represented a significant improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/5">The council's lack of workload prioritisation and forward planning was causing unnecessary delays. In particular, it had not set any internal targets for Benefits staff. This was compounded by a lack of procedural guidance throughout the Benefits service, leading to inconsistent working practices. Inspectors found that this was one of a number of Internal Audit recommendations that the council had failed to act upon.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/6">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and may ask the council for its proposals in response to the BFI's findings.</p>
