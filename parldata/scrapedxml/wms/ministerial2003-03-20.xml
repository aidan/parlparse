	<p>On behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) has today announced its programme of activity for 2003&ndash;04 (Phase 8).</p>
	<p>The BFI is an independent unit within the Department for Work and Pensions that inspects and reports directly to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, on the standard of benefit administration and counter-fraud activity in local authorities and Departmental agencies.</p>
	<p>As part of the Phase 8 activity, the BFI will be inspecting 8 of the poorest performing councils identified through the comprehensive performance assessment process: Barking and Dagenham, Bury, Isle of Wight, Knowsley, Milton Keynes, Portsmouth, Swindon, and Wokingham. These local authorities are collectively responsible for paying out nearly &pound;200 million per year in housing benefits.</p>
	<p>BFI is also offering specialist advice as part of its Performance Improvement Action Team programme to a further 9 poor performing councils identified through the comprehensive performance assessment process.</p>
	<p>The BFI will undertake a first inspection of Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, which performed well during the 2002 comprehensive performance assessment of its benefit service, but has consistently failed to provide quarterly management information to the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p>Follow-up inspections on other local authorities will also be undertaken. These authorities have been identified from post-inspection monitoring of performance.</p>
	<p>In addition to first and follow-up inspections, the BFI will also undertake comprehensive performance assessments in England on the benefits service for 183 district local authorities, and updates on the 115 single tier local authorities assessed in 2002.</p>
	<p>In Scotland, BFI will undertake 10 best value inspections in partnership with Audit Scotland. BFI will also undertake assessments of the benefits service for the 22 Welsh local authorities as part of the Wales Programme for Improvement.</p>

	Invest to Save Budget: Round 5
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-03-20.48WS.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/741" speakername="Paul Boateng" speakeroffice="The Chief Secretary to the Treasury" colnum="48WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030320/wmstext/30320m01.htm#30320m01.html_spmin2">
	<p>I am pleased to announce that 48 bids from across the public and voluntary sectors have been successful in Round 5 of the Invest to Save Budget at a cost of &pound;32 million including consequential funding for the devolved Administrations, and &pound;28 million in total over the 3 years to 2005&ndash;06. The attached table describes the winners of this round.</p>
	<p>The Invest to Save Budget (ISB) is a joint Treasury/Cabinet Office initiative. It provides support for projects which increase the extent of joint working between different parts of government, identify innovative ways of delivering public services and reduce the cost of delivering the services and/or improve the quality and effectiveness of services delivered to the public. This is the fifth round of the ISB which started in 1999.</p>
	<p>It is expected that a total of &pound;354 million will be spent on ISB projects over the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004. Round One was restricted to central government departments and their agencies. In the second and third rounds local authorities, police and fire authorities, health authorities, non-departmental public bodies and public corporations could also apply. In the fourth round, voluntary sector bodies were able to apply for the first time. The fifth round continues the partnership and innovation themes and is encouraging effective project and risk management.</p>
	<p>Winning projects have to agree an implementation plan with the sponsor departments. Each project has to provide six-monthly progress reports and carry out an evaluation of its success once it has been completed. Wider dissemination of the good practice from completed projects is then fed back into the whole spectrum of public service providers.</p>

	Threat of Terrorism
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-03-20.51WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/739" speakername="David Blunkett" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="51WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030320/wmstext/30320m02.htm#30320m02.html_spmin0">
	<p>When I last spoke to the House of Commons about terrorism on 3 March 2003, I made clear that this country continues to face a significant threat from international terrorism.</p>
	<p>In agreeing to renew Part Four of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, Parliament accepted that we need to continue to protect ourselves from those who recognise no legal procedures, no boundaries and no parameters in terms of the action they are prepared to take.</p>
	<p>The terrorist threat remains real, and is serious. In the context of the present situation and concern that terrorists may seek to exploit the commencement of hostilities with Iraq by attempting attacks.</p>
	<p>I should assure the House and the public that we have taken and are taking every feasible precautionary measure to protect British citizens both here and abroad.</p>
	<p>I must re-emphasise that if a warning is necessary to protect safety, we issue it&mdash;and will issue it&mdash;without hesitation. And we will give any further information that helps people respond effectively.</p>
	<p>As I promised the House of Commons on 3 March, we have set up a dedicated website, <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/terrorism">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/terrorism</a>, which went live on 18 March. That website provides a central point to publish advice and information from the security and intelligence services, on civil resilience, and other material that departments publish. It gives advice to the public on what measures they can take to protect themselves and their families at home, at work and when preparing to go abroad. And it provides information on the measures the Government is taking to protect British citizens and British interests, including information on departments and agencies, legislation, protecting our infrastructure, and resilience and contingency planning.</p>
	<p>I further made it clear in a written statement on civil contingencies (available on the &quot;reports and publications&quot; section of the new website) laid before the House on the same day that we have taken important steps to improve our resilience and contingency planning to deal with terrorist attacks should they occur.</p>
	<p>The emergency services now have more equipment and trained officers to enable them to respond to a release of CBRN material and this has been accompanied by the publication of specific protocols for dealing with this kind of attack. For example, under a &pound;5 million programme, the Department of Health has provided 360 mobile decontamination units; the CBRN Police Training Centre has been established at Winterbourne Gunner and the police now have 2,350 officers trained and equipped in CBRN response. Since 11 September 2001, &pound;96 million has been spent on CBRN medical countermeasures, including spending on extra vaccines and antibiotics.</p>
	<p>We have also looked hard at local resilience and London resilience and taken steps at both these levels to review and improve capability through funding and personnel training. But we must continue to strengthen and improve our resilience</p>
