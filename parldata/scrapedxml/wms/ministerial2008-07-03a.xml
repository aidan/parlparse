<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-03a.53WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families" colnum="53WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080703/wmstext/80703m0001.htm#08070362000145">
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/1">In the children's plan, which I presented to Parliament in December 2007, the Government set out their ambition to make this country the best place in the world for young people to grow up. As part of this, we committed to world-class standards in education; a new role for schools as the centre of their communities; and more effective links between schools, health and other children's services, brought together by children's trusts in every area, so that together they can tackle all the barriers to the learning, health and happiness of every child.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/2">Today we are taking the next steps to make a reality of these ambitions, and are publishing three consultation documents, copies of which I have placed in the Library of the House. They each draw heavily on the experience, best practice and views of local authorities, schools and other key partners, for which I am most grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/3">Schools have traditionally taken a broad view of education as the development of the whole child, in order to tackle all the barriers to learning inside and outside the school, so that every child can fulfil their potential and get the good qualifications they need. The Government have supported this by placing on schools a duty to promote the well-being of their pupils. This means they have a duty to support the development of all their pupils across all five Every Child Matters outcomes, so that they are healthy, safe, able to enjoy and achieve their potential, secure economically, and can make a positive contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/4">The first of the three consultation documents is draft guidance to schools which explains in more detail what is meant by 'promoting well-being' and what support schools should expect from their local authority and other partners in their children's trust. At the heart of the children's plan is the vision of a '21st century school': a school which achieves high standards and embraces its role in the wider development of young people, in support of its core mission of ensuring through excellent teaching and learning that all children achieve their potential, and in partnership with parents, other schools and other local agencies. Schools need to be well supported by, and able to work effectively with, a range of other partners including statutory services and the voluntary and community sector, and children's trust arrangements are intended to bring together all these services locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/5">The second document consults on how we should strengthen children's trusts in order to deliver for all children and young people; to ensure schools consistently get the timely support they need; to narrow gaps in outcomes between disadvantaged young people and their peers; and to take action early where children have additional needs. A great deal is being achieved by leading local areas within the existing framework, and the challenge now is to ensure that good practice is widely implemented and deeply embedded. There is now a strong case for strengthening the statutory basis of children's trusts on the model of existing good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/6">Schools are key partners for children's trusts at the local and neighbourhood level, and are well placed to give early warning when things are going wrong for young people. To achieve the objectives of the children''s plan, schools must be effectively supported by wider children's services and involved in determining the strategic direction and commissioning arrangements for those services at board level. Strong collaborative working of this kind is generally welcomed in principle, but in practice can be difficult to achieve. This was a key message from our recent consultation on our draft supplementary guidance to local authorities and others on the 'duty to co-operate' (children's trust guidance).</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/7">The second document proposes a number of changes to the current framework for children's trusts. These include extending responsibility for children and young people's plans and being clearer about what they should cover, extending the 'duty to co-operate' to schools, and requiring through statute the creation of children's trust boards with a defined set of functions and responsibilities. Our proposals include:</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/8" class="indent">requiring all areas to have a children's and young people's plan, and extending ownership of the plan to all statutory partners. Children's and young people's plans are currently local authority plans, although they must consult with other partners and the plans must cover the full range of outcomes for children. Extending responsibility for the plan to all partners covered by the 'duty to co-operate' would mean that the plan becomes the shared responsibility of the children's trust board;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/9" class="indent">strengthening the statutory framework for children's and young people's plans through secondary legislation. This could include clarifying that plans must be agreed by all partners, set out the arrangements for early intervention, including for the children's workforce and specify the spend of each partner on areas such as child health and youth offending, in particular those covered by local joint commissioning arrangements. This would establish a higher baseline for the quality of plans in line with the best practice already established in many areas;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/10" class="indent">extending the 'duty to co-operate' to schools, to schools forums and to sixth form and further education colleges, with future academies brought within scope through their funding agreements. This duty currently applies to local authorities, primary care trusts and other strategic partners. Extending the duty to front line providers of education would give them corresponding rights within trusts to a stronger voice, more influence over their strategic arrangements, and better support from other statutory partners;</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/11" class="indent">establishing a stronger statutory basis for children's trust boards, on the model of existing good practice and with significant local flexibility. Leading local areas have already put in place children's trust boards which have the representation and functions that primary or secondary legislation could prescribe for all. Setting out core membership and functions in legislation could help secure more consistent performance and more robust operation of children's trusts. An alternative would be to create reserve powers for Ministers to direct areas when local arrangements are not operating successfully.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/12">I have invited comments on these proposals, and also on what other changes to primary or secondary legislation should be considered in this area, for example to ensure the voluntary and third sectors can play a full role in local children's services.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/13">The third document relates specifically to the local authority's strategic leadership role in promoting high standards in education, as established by the Education and Inspections Act 2006. This is a key part of their wider role in promoting the well-being of all children and young people in their local area. The 2006 Act provides the current legal framework for schools causing concern, and makes a crucial contribution to school improvement by enabling early action by local authorities to improve school performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/14">Local authorities may already consider a formal warning notice which allows them to employ a range of intervention powers, even where OFSTED has not graded the school as 'inadequate'. It is important that these powers are used when it is appropriate, because they are designed to address issues where schools are under-performing before they become more serious. As announced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-10">10 June 2008</phrase> as part of our national challenge proposals, the Government therefore propose, subject to the agreement of Parliament, to take a new legislative power in the forthcoming Education and Skills Bill to require authorities to consider formal warning notices when these are clearly justified by the school's performance, and also proposes to extend the current power to require authorities to take additional advisory services where this is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.53WS.5/15">The children's plan set out a vision in which local authorities, schools and other local providers work together and support each other, both in setting the direction and in driving delivery. The three documents published today, taken together, gives us a framework that will help make this vision a reality. The consultations will remain open until <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-25">25 September 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.58WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-21">21 February</phrase> I made a statement to the House regarding new information we had been passed by the United States Government regarding rendition. Contrary to earlier assurances that Diego Garcia had not been used for rendition flights, United States investigations had revealed two occasions, both in 2002, when this had in fact occurred. Since February, I have corresponded with Secretary Rice on this issue and our officials have continued to work through the details and implications of the new information.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/2">I promised the House that, as part of this of this process, my officials would compile a list of flights where we had been alerted to concern about rendition through the UK or our overseas territories. The list which they have compiled, containing 391 flights, reflects concerns put to us by hon. Members, members of the public, multilateral organisations and non-governmental organisations. Inclusion on this list does not represent an official endorsement of any allegations about a particular flight. On the contrary, US Government flights&mdash;as with other Government flights&mdash;occur regularly for a variety of purposes. Our intention was to collate in one place those concerns that had been put to us directly. The list was passed to the US on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-15">15 May</phrase>. I undertook in February to publish the list and have today placed a copy in the Library of the House and published it on the FCO website at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/3">The US Government received the list of flights from the UK Government. The US Government confirmed that, with the exception of two cases related to Diego Garcia in 2002, there have been no other instances in which US intelligence flights landed in the United Kingdom, our overseas territories, or the Crown dependencies, with a detainee on board since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/4">Our US allies are agreed on the need to seek our permission for any future renditions through UK territory. Secretary Rice has underlined to me the firm US understanding that there will be no rendition through the UK, our overseas territories and Crown dependencies or airspace without first receiving our express permission. We have made clear that we would only grant such permission if we were satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations. The circumstances of any such request would be carefully examined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.58WS.2/5">Our intelligence and counter-terrorism relationship with the US is vital to the national security of the United Kingdom. There must and will continue to be the strongest possible intelligence and counter-terrorism relationship between our two countries, consistent with UK law and our international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="a.59WS.4/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-03">3 July 2007</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-07-03.815"><i>Official Report</i>, column 815</phrase>), the Prime Minister made a statement to Parliament publishing &quot;The Governance of Britain&quot; Green Paper. The Green Paper set out a route map for further constitutional reform, better to strengthen the relationship between Government, Parliament and the citizen, and to take steps towards a new constitutional settlement. This builds on fundamental reforms carried out by the Government since 1997 including devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the transformation of the role of the Lord Chancellor, the introduction of a Supreme Court, the Human Rights Act and the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/2">Renewing our democracy is at the heart of our reforms, building a new relationship between citizens and Government and ensuring that the rights of individuals are fully respected.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/3">One year on, much progress has been made against the Governiance of Britain ambitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/4" class="italic">Limiting the powers of the executive</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/5">The Government committed to surrendering or limiting powers which it considers should not, in a modern democracy, be exercised exclusively by the executive. We have carried out consultations on Parliament's role in decisions relating to the deployment of the armed forces into armed conflict and the ratification of treaties, the role of the Attorney-General, Government's role in judicial appointments, protest around Parliament and the flying of the Union flag. Alongside the responses to the Government's 2004 consultation on the civil service, these consultations informed the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill and White Paper, which is now being considered by a Joint Committee. The draft Constitutional Renewal Bill contains important measures to strengthen Parliament and make Government more accountable to the people it serves. It encompasses five areas of reform, and includes proposals to:</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/6" class="indent">repeal of the provisions in sections 132-138 of Serious and Organised Crime Act on protest around Parliament;</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/7" class="indent">reform the role of the Attorney-General;</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/8" class="indent">reduce the role played by the Lord Chancellor in judicial appointments;</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/9" class="indent">formalise the procedure for Parliament to scrutinise treaties prior to ratification; and</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/10" class="indent">enshrine in statute the core values of the civil service&mdash;as well as the historic principle of appointment on merit, and place the Civil Service Commissioners onto a statutory footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/11">The Government also want Parliament to have the right to take the final decision about committing armed forces in to armed conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/12" class="italic">Making the executive more accountable</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/13">The Government are committed to rebalancing power between Parliament and Government, and giving Parliament greater ability to hold Government to account. We have:</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/14" class="indent">published the draft legislative programme for scrutiny by Parliament and the public in 2007 and in 2008;</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/15" class="indent">commenced a pilot of pre-appointment hearings for key public appointments and agreed a list of 60 suitable appointments with the Liaison Committee;</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/16" class="indent">published the national security strategy for the first time; and</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/17" class="indent">set up an independent UK Statistics Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/18" class="italic">Re-invigorating our democracy</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/19">It is vital that our institutions are legitimate, trusted and responsive to the people they serve. We have:</p>
	<p pid="a.59WS.4/20" class="indent">established the Youth Citizenship Commission to look at how we can give young people a greater voice, and</p>
