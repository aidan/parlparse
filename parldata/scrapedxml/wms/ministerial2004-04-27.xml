	<p>The Government published yesterday &quot;Energy Efficiency&mdash;The Government's Plan for Action&quot;<i>.</i> This fulfils our commitment in the February 2003 energy White Paper to set out our delivery plan for the energy efficiency strategy contained in the White Paper. Copies of the plan were placed in the House Libraries yesterday.</p>
	<p>In the document &quot;Energy Efficiency&mdash;The Government's Plan for Action&quot;, I have designated an energy efficiency aim in accordance with the duty set out in section 2(1) of the Sustainable Energy Act 2003; such aim relates to the energy efficiency of residential accommodation in England and is compatible with Community obligations and any other international obligations of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p>The Government yesterday also published the first annual report on the energy White Paper, the Strategy for Combined Heat and Power to 2010, and the second fuel poverty annual report. Copies of these documents were also placed in the House Libraries yesterday.</p>
	<p>In her written statement to the House of Commons on 3 February 2004, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the Government envisaged publication of the fuel poverty implementation plan with the above documents. The Government now envisage publication of the fuel poverty implementation plan in the summer.</p>

	<p>My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has published for public consultation proposed changes to the Ashford growth area section of chapter XII of regional planning guidance for the South East (RPG9). They follow the public examination into the draft in December 2003 and the panel report in February 2004.</p>
	<p>Growth areas are an integral part of regional planning guidance (RPG) and the draft chapter represents a revision to RPG9, as published in March 2001.</p>
	<p>Other partial reviews of RPG9 are at various stages in the process. In particular, a public examination into the Milton Keynes and South Midlands sub-regional strategy is under way, and the Secretary of State's proposed changes for the regional transport strategy are out for consultation.</p>
	<p>Ashford is both a centre for regional economic development and a gateway to Europe. Growth must bring real benefits to the whole community, which is why our proposed policies promote the right development in the right place at the right time.</p>
	<p>The regional planning guidance needs to define new policies that will not only support the projected growth of housing and jobs in Ashford but will guide the growth in a sustainable way.</p>
	<p>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister proposes accepting all the recommendations of the independent panel that held the public examination into the proposed alterations, with minor modifications.</p>
	<p>I have written to the regional assembly with the proposed changes. There will now be a public consultation period on the proposed changes, which will end on 17 June.</p>
	<p>Copies of the relevant documents are available in the Libraries of both Houses and have been provided for all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>
