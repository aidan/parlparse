	<p pid=".117WS.2/1">I am announcing today the publication of a consultation draft of a new planning policy statement on biodiversity and geological conservation and a draft circular (published jointly with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) to accompany it. The draft of planning policy statement 9 (PPS9) sets out the Government's national planning policies for biodiversity and geological conservation. The accompanying draft circular provides administrative guidance on the application of the law relating to planning and nature conservation as it applies in England.</p>
	<p pid=".117WS.2/2">It is intended that PPS9, together with the circular and future good practice guidance will, in due course replace planning policy guidance note 9 on nature conservation published in 1994. The draft PPS9, and its supporting documents meet the commitment set out in the planning Green Paper for shorter, more focused and policy rich statements of planning policy with separate advice on non-policy matters.</p>
	<p pid=".117WS.2/3">The draft PPS takes account of legislative changes since 1994 that affect biodiversity and geological conservation, and reflects the commitments in the &quot;Biodiversity Strategy for England&quot;, published in 2002. It has a clearer focus on the need to conserve, enhance and restore biological diversity.</p>
	<p pid=".117WS.2/4">Consultation on the draft of PPS9 and the accompanying draft circular will run until <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-09">9 December 2004</phrase>. Copies of the draft consultation papers have been made available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	Mental Health Bill
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-09-08.118WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" speakername="Rosie Winterton" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health" colnum="118WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040908/wmstext/40908m01.htm#40908m01.html_spmin2">
	<p pid=".118WS.2/1">The Government have today published a Mental Health Bill. This Bill will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. A joint scrutiny committee has been established and has been asked to present its report by the end of March 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".118WS.2/2">Mental health legislation sets out the circumstances in which a person can be treated for mental disorder without their consent and the safeguards they are entitled to. The vast majority of people with mental health problems do not need to be treated against their wishes but occasionally this is necessary, normally to protect themselves, but more occasionally to protect others.</p>
	<p pid=".118WS.2/3">It has long been recognised that the current mental health legislation, the Mental Health Act 1983, needs to be updated, in line with the development of services and of human rights law to give a greater focus on patients' needs and wishes. In 1998, the Government set up an expert committee to advise on how mental health legislation should be shaped to reflect contemporary patterns of care and treatment and to support government policy. In 2002, following a Green and a White Paper, a draft Bill was published for consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".118WS.2/4">Since then, the comments received on the 2002 draft have been considered in full and, following further work and meetings with stakeholders, a revised Bill has been produced. We have made changes to address the concerns expressed by stakeholders. The Bill brings the framework for the compulsory treatment of people with serious mental health disorders up to date.</p>
	<p pid=".118WS.2/5">This Bill needs to be considered in the context of the wider Government strategy to improve mental health services. In 1998, the National Service Framework for mental health set out national standards for the care and treatment of adults with mental disorder. The NHS Plan announced, in 2000, substantial additional investment for mental health services. As a result of the National Service Framework and the additional investment, significant improvements have been made in mental health services. This is particularly the case in relation to community-based services, such as crisis resolution and assertive outreach teams. It is important that mental health legislation is now modernised.</p>
	<p pid=".118WS.2/6">The Bill will provide important benefits. The Bill means that the small minority of people with mental health problems who need to be treated against their wishes, normally for their protection but occasionally to protect the public, will get the right treatment at the right time. This meets the needs of the individual patient and makes sure that the public is protected.</p>
	<p pid=".118WS.2/7">The Bill ensures there is no compulsion without the provision of appropriate treatment. Safeguards for patients will be greatly strengthened with a choice of representative, access to advocacy and all use of compulsory treatment beyond 28 days having to be authorised by the new independent mental health tribunal or the courts. Under the Bill, patients who are ill and vulnerable will be able to get the treatment they need in the community, including non-dangerous mentally disordered offenders who may otherwise receive a prison sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".118WS.2/8">Legislation about compulsory treatment inevitably raises many difficult issues. There has already been much discussion about this proposed new legislation. Pre-legislative scrutiny will now allow further considered debate. We look forward to receiving the report of the scrutiny committee.</p>
	<p pid=".118WS.2/9">Copies of the Bill and of the explanatory notes have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".119WS.2/1">The Government are firmly committed to ensuring that the country information material they produce to inform asylum decisions meets the highest standards.</p>
	<p pid=".119WS.2/2">Accurate, objective and up to date country information is fundamental to a fair and effective asylum system. The independent advisory panel on country information (APCI) was set up to provide rigorous external scrutiny of country information material produced by the Home Office and make recommendations to help ensure that it is of the highest quality. The APCI has already shown itself to be working in a robust and forthright manner.</p>
	<p pid=".119WS.2/3">While we are satisfied that the country information material produced by the Home Office is already of a good standard, we recognise that improvements can be made. We have responded swiftly and positively to issues raised by the APCI and announced earlier this year the introduction of a range of improvements in the way the material is produced and quality assured. The measures introduced were welcomed by the APCI and have resulted in a clear improvement in the quality and presentation of country information material.</p>
	<p pid=".119WS.2/4">The panel rightly considers it essential that the Home Office's country information material should not only be objective in fact, but that it should also be perceived as being objective and have the confidence of all its users. The APCI was concerned that the country information would not be perceived as impartial while it was being produced by country information and policy unit (CIPU) which also has the function of advising on the development of country specific asylum policies. The APCI made a recommendation that the Home Office bring forward proposals to address this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".119WS.2/5">We have given very careful consideration to the APCI's recommendation and I am announcing today that the current country information and country policy functions of the CIPU will be separated. In future, the production of country information material used by the Home Office will be undertaken by a country information unit dedicated solely to that function. The existing CIPU country policy function will be undertaken separately within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. These changes, which directly reflect the APCI's thinking, will be put in place as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>
	<p pid=".119WS.2/6">I am also announcing today that in future country reports will be produced and published at six-monthly intervals on the top 20 asylum generating countries (and other countries for which an operational need is identified) instead of the current top 35 countries. The reduction in the number of country reports produced is consistent with the significant reduction in asylum intake. This step will enable the resources freed to be used to help assure the standard of the country information material produced, whilst ensuring that country reports are still produced on the main asylum generating countries. Country information material will continue to be produced on those countries which fall outside the top 20 in the way that is now done for countries which fall outside the top 35.</p>

	<p pid=".120WS.1/1">I am publishing today a consultation document setting out options for new fees for immigration applications.

Key targets 2 and 3 are consistent with the goals set in the Department's public service agreement (PSA) for major equipment projects, although for the key targets, all movement in most likely ISD and cost forecasts will be measured, rather than only that which is in excess of the approval. The fourth key target relates to improvements in DPA Customer satisfaction. A revised key target 5, comprising a basket of measures, replaces the previous straight measure in order to provide a better indication of DPA efficiency. There is a new sixth key target reflecting the importance which the Department attaches to delivery of assets to the front-line. The key targets are:</p>
	<p pid=".121WS.2/3" class="italic">Key Target 1: Key requirements Compliance</p>
	<p pid=".121WS.2/4">Predicted achievement of customers' core requirements <sup>1</sup> for projects: 97 per cent.</p>

	Deployment of RAF Harrier GR7s to Afghanistan

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-09-08.122WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/970" speakername="Geoff Hoon" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Defence" colnum="122WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040908/wmstext/40908m02.htm#40908m02.html_spmin3">
	<p pid=".122WS.1/1">The United Kingdom has a long-standing commitment to help the people of Afghanistan to rebuild their country as a stable, secure and prosperous nation. That process is now approaching a vital stage. NATO is in the process of expanding the international security assistance force (ISAF) by creating more provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs). The coalition, meanwhile, continues to deploy PRTs of its own and to engage the remnants of the Taliban and its al-Qaeda supporters that reject all the Afghan people have achieved since 2001. Both the ISAF and the coalition provide essential support to the Afghan transitional authority and to the United Nations' Assistance Mission Afghanistan as they prepare for the Afghan presidential elections which are due on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-09">9 October 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".122WS.1/2">These are important tasks and both the coalition and the ISAF merit our support. In response to a coalition request for the United Kingdom to provide a close air support capability to coalition forces operating in southern Afghanistan, I have agreed the deployment of six Royal Air Force Harrier GR7 aircraft to Kandahar, Afghanistan. The aircraft will be provided by No. 3 Squadron, Royal Air Force, and the deployment is planned to be for nine months. The first personnel from 53 Field Squadron (Airfield Support), Royal Engineers, and No. 3 Squadron have already deployed to Kandahar and the force should be operational by the end of this month. The deployment will reach a strength of some 315 personnel in its early stages but will eventually settle at a strength of about 230. The cost of the deployment is estimated to be some &pound;35.5 million.</p>
	<p pid=".122WS.1/3">This is our first deployment of combat aircraft to Afghanistan in the current campaign. While their principal role will be to support coalition forces, the aircraft will also be available to support the ISAF. NATO has identified three such tasks: close air support as ISAF expands into Western Afghanistan; an airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability to support all ISAF forces, and; the provision of &quot;air presence patrols&quot; as part of the ISAF's support for the security of the Afghan presidential elections.</p>
	<p pid=".122WS.1/4">The versatility of the Harriers, which will be equipped with laser-guided bombs, air to surface missiles and the joint reconnaissance pod, makes them an ideal asset to meet all these tasks. Deployment of these aircraft confirms our commitment to the NATO mission in Afghanistan, our support for the ISAF and our determination to help ensure the success of the international community's support for the Afghan electoral process. The Army and Royal Air Force personnel will provide a highly capable and credible force that will contribute to improving the security environment in the region. This is another clear sign of the UK's long term commitment to achieving a stable and secure Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid=".123WS.1/1">In 1997 the initial and major phase of the transfer of support service activities to Flagship Training Ltd (Flagship), under partnership arrangements with the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency (NRTA), was agreed and subsequently implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".123WS.1/2">I am pleased to inform the House that I have now agreed in principle to the next phase under this arrangement and the transfer of the provision of services which falls into two categories: harmonisation, and the integration of the nuclear department.</p>
	<p pid=".123WS.1/3">This phase will enhance the support services already transferred, providing greater efficiencies and effectiveness across the five major training Establishments for the Royal Navy. There are potential total savings for the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency of approximately &pound;6 million over the remainder of the contract period to 2011.</p>
	<p pid=".123WS.1/4">The anticipated number of posts to be transferred is 296 (273 civilian and 23 service) under harmonisation and 24 (20 civilian and 4 Service) in the nuclear department. The trades unions have been regularly informed of progress and the formal consultation process has begun. A copy of the consultative documents has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
