	<p pid="a.36WS.2/1">The United Kingdom will be represented at this month's Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg by the Deputy Ambassador to the European Union and by the Director for Analysis and CAP Strategy in Defra.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/2">The Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner will provide a written update to the Council on developments with regard to the spread of the Avian Influenza H5N1 virus.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/3">The Council will then adopt a proposal to broaden the scope of the current provision for exceptional measures in the poultry meat and eggs sectors to help them through a drop in sales caused by consumer fears about avian influenza. The UK will support the proposals but make clear that such measures should only be used in exceptional circumstances and should not distort the normal competitive nature of the EU market.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/4">The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development will update the Council on the WTO agricultural negotiations. The UK will press for every effort to be made to make progress in the negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/5">The Council will hold an exchange of views on a Commission Communication on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry. The Communication highlights measures already available to the fishing industry to cope with higher fuel prices and other economic concerns, but also proposes a new measure to support the upgrading of engines in fishing vessels. The UK will express concern that the latter could lead to an increase in fishing capacity, contradicting the principle established in the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy and out of line with a long term sustainable solution for fish stocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/6">The Council will also hold its first ministerial exchange of views on the Commission's draft action plan for simplifying the common fisheries policy. The UK will intervene to welcome the Commission's initiative and the work done so far and press for more detailed proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/7">The Council will hold a policy debate on the Commission's proposal for a management plan for North sea plaice and sole which would span a number of years. The UK will urge that the plan is consistent with the principle of long-term sustainable management and is achieved at a manageable rate for the fishing industry. We would also want to avoid proposals for plaice and sole which damage the potential for recovery of cod stocks, since the same vessels can be used to catch all three species.</p>

	<p pid="a.38WS.2/1">This statement sets out how my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment intend to take forward action to help combat losses due to fuel smuggling in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/2">Honourable Members will be aware that the loss to HM Treasury due to smuggling of non duty paid fuels amounts to some &pound;245 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/3">It was against this backdrop that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, when asked to consider what steps might be taken to ensure a robust and consistent enforcement of petroleum licensing conditions across Northern Ireland proposed that the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI) which is the regional authority for health and safety at work, might assume responsibility for petroleum licensing.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/4">This move would see HSENI having responsibility for policing the entire fuel oils supply chain. This would be a logical step as it already has direct responsibility for bulk fuel oil storage at harbour terminals and for its transport by road tankers&mdash;adding retail petrol stations would complete the chain. This proposal is strongly supported by the Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/5">Such a move would permit a more consistent and robust approach to enforcement. It would also allow for a more targeted approach to inspection, provide a single point of contact for the other key agencies involved and lay the foundations of an audit trail as well as improve intelligence generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/6">Government will now consult on this proposal, which could, among other things, involve amendments to the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929. Depending on the duration of any consultation on the legislation, this transfer (change) in responsibilities could be achieved in 9&ndash;12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/7">I am pleased to be able to commend this proposal to the House. I am confident that, subject to the completion of a robust consultation process with the local authorities in Northern Ireland, and the allocation of the necessary resource, it would deliver an effective tool to reduce the losses and help bring an end to criminal activity in this area.</p>
