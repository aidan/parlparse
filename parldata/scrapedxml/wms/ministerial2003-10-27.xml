<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-10-27.1WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/980" speakername="Beverley Hughes" speakeroffice="The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration" colnum="1WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo031027/wmstext/31027m01.htm#31027m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".1WS.2/1">The Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1033" name="David Lammy">the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy)</phrase> and I have today announced new legislative proposals for asylum reform. We are writing to a number of key stakeholders outlining these proposals and inviting comments. I will be placing copies of this letter in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament and on the IND and DCA websites. The major proposals include: reform of the immigration and asylum appeals system into a single tier of appeal with restricted access to the higher courts; measures to tackle the problem of asylum seekers deliberately destroying or disposing of their documents to make unfounded claims; provisions removing NASS support from families whose claim for asylum has been rejected and enhancing the effectiveness of the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.2/2">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 has enabled us to make significant progress in reforming the UK's nationality, immigration and asylum systems. In the asylum system this has meant that the number of people claiming asylum has halved, removals are at record levels and the number of claims awaiting an initial decision is at the lowest for a decade. The Government determined that there should be a balanced approach in asylum and immigration policy so that we bear down on those who would seek to enter the UK illegally and who make unfounded asylum claims, whilst ensuring effective help for refugees who need our protection. Our policy on asylum has to be seen in the wider context of managed migration, through which we are opening up routes for people to enter the UK legally. That is why we are committed to continued reform, as necessary, of the asylum system to ensure that those in need of protection are identified quickly and those who try to exploit the system are prevented from doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.2/3">We believe that these reforms should be in place as a matter of urgency and will introduce legislation to enact the measures as soon as parliamentary time allows. We are therefore urgently seeking comments from interested parties on the proposals. We would welcome views on the proposals by <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-17">17 November</phrase>.</p>

This outlined a range of proposals to provide more effective support to people with health conditions and disabled people. The Pathways to Work pilots represent the next steps in the Government's strategy of providing people with health conditions and disabilities with the help and support they need&mdash;particularly support in helping them into employment. My Department, together with the Department of Health and appropriate Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly officials, have been preparing for the implementation of the Pilots.</p>

	<p pid=".2WS.2/3">Today, I am pleased to announce the launch of the first three pilots&mdash;Bridgend Rhondda Cynon Taf; Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Argyll &amp; Bute; and Derbyshire.</p>
	<p pid=".2WS.2/4">The pilots will provide a range of individual help and support (including new condition management programmes provided by the NHS and a range of financial incentives) for people with health conditions and disabilities.
