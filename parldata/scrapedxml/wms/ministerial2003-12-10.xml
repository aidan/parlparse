Libyan nationals coming to the UK in any capacity other than for marriage were previously granted a maximum of six months leave to enter. This restriction has now been lifted. There will no longer be a distinction between Libyan nationals and the nationals of other countries who require a visa to come here.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.5/2">Restrictions on visas were the last of a range of immigration measures taken in relation to Libya to remain in force. They have been lifted as a reflection of the improved bilateral relationship between the United Kingdom and Libya, which has seen the recent agreement on Lockerbie. The Government continue to support the Metropolitan Police in seeking Libyan assistance with their investigation into the murder of WPC Fletcher.</p>

	<p pid=".81WS.8/1">I have today laid an amendment to the building regulations deferring introduction of pre-completion testing of the sound insulation between new houses and flats to <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-01">1 July 2004</phrase>. This will allow more time for consideration of the results of a consultation into the construction industry's proposals for the robust standard details alternative to testing.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.8/2">In the interim, consumers will remain protected by new standards introduced in July this year, which will continue to be enforced by building control bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.8/3">Noise is one of the issues that people really care about. We remain committed to improving quality of life and will continue to work with industry to build better, safer and more environmentally friendly homes.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.8/4">The revised Part E (resistance to the passage of sound) of the building regulations came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase> and introduced requirements for pre-completion testing of sound insulation between dwellings. For dwellings created by conversion work and new or converted accommodation that is not self-contained, the requirements for testing came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase>. For new houses and flats it was due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.8/5">This later date was to give the House Builders Federation (HBF) time to develop robust standard details&mdash;constructions that perform consistently well and so do not need regular testing.

	<p pid=".82WS.2/1">In December 2002 the Council of Ministers decided that satellite monitoring for Community fishing vessels over 24 metres should be extended, first to vessels over 18 metres from <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase> and then to vessels over 15 metres from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>. Detailed rules subsequently adopted by the European Commission in October 2003 require Member States to take measures to ensure that satellite tracking devices fitted to fishing vessels do not permit the input or output of false positions and are not capable of being over-ridden.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.2/2">To secure the maximum enforcement benefit from vessel monitoring systems it has been decided that tracking devices fitted to UK fishing vessels should be fully &quot;tamper proof&quot; and dedicated to position reporting.</p>
	<p pid=".82WS.2/3">Since such terminals may not be used by vessel owners or masters for business purposes, and subject to Parliamentary approval, DEFRA has decided to meet the costs of fitting tamper proof terminals to those UK registered vessels for which it is the licensing authority. The arrangements will be time limited. They will apply to existing vessels and those that join the fleet before <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>. It is expected that around 280 vessels will be equipped with tamper proof terminals by the end of 2004 at an overall cost of less than &pound;1 million.</p>

	<p pid=".83WS.2/1">I have today published, as Cm 6081, a draft Single European Currency (Referendum) Bill. The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a commitment to Parliament in June 2003 that a draft Bill would be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/2">This draft Bill sets out the Government's thinking on the terms on which any referendum on the European single currency would be held, subject to the five economic tests being met. This shows the Government's commitment to openness and transparency. Both the question and who would be able to vote in any referendum, if the five economic tests had been met, are set out in the draft Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".83WS.2/3">The Government will report on progress of its reform agenda in the Budget next year. The Government can then consider the extent of progress and determine whether on the basis of it the Government makes a further Treasury assessment of the five tests, which&mdash;if positive next year&mdash;would allow it at that time to put the issue before the electorate in a referendum.</p>

Terms of reference are annexed. The conclusion of the travel advice review will be placed before both Houses.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/2">Since September 11 2001, it has been increasingly clear that we face a form of international terrorism which aims not only to take life randomly by suicide attack, but which seeks to use fear and instability to undermine the freedom and prosperity which the terrorists hate.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/3">Our policy must be to deny the terrorists any advantage. We must take prudent precautions, while minimising the disruption which terrorists want to cause. Some disruption is, of course, inevitable if we are to make likely targets as secure as we can. But we must all be clear that total security is not possible. Everybody who goes about their business in a modern city and elsewhere makes a balanced judgment of risk against security. People continue to go about their daily lives&mdash; vigilantly, amid sound precautions&mdash;because they are not prepared to give the terrorists satisfaction. Our determination to maintain as normal a life as possible is a weapon against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/4">It is important that British citizens travelling abroad should have the best possible information on risk, from the Government. We have extensively reviewed and improved our travel advice since Bali. But I have asked officials to look again at some of the underlying issues, in light of recent experience. What is the right balance between information, warning and advice? I am clear that our advice should give the most detailed and timely factual information possible, but in what circumstances should this information be complemented, where appropriate, with advice not to travel? What is the impact and the cost of our warnings not to travel? And what would be the implications of a different approach? We may conclude that the nature of our advice is as good as we can make it, or we may find that improvements are necessary. We will be seeking as many views as possible including, of course, that of Members of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/5">Security is always at the top of our agenda. We keep the security of all our posts under constant review and frequently re-assess the risks and the measures needed to manage them in the light of changing threat levels. Funds have been authorised for the most urgent expenditure. Following the attack on our consulate in Istanbul, which showed that our overseas missions and staff are in the front line, we immediately asked all posts to check their security measures. We are also looking at additional measures we can take at high-risk posts. In addition, we have instigated an internal review of the FCO's security strategy, in particular the balance between security and operational effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/6">The terms of reference for these reviews are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/7"><i>TRAVEL ADVICE REVIEW</i> Terms of reference</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/8" class="italic">How can FCO advice best help UK travellers?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/9" class="indent">How can our Travel Advice best help its users to make informed, responsible decisions about possible risks overseas, particularly from terrorism, and ways they can minimise them?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/10" class="indent">What should be the balance in our Travel Advice between information, warning and advice (ie between description of risks in particular countries and prescription of action in response)?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/11" class="indent">How far can risk analysis and its presentation be made more objective (eg through statistical analysis and comparison with non-terrorist hazards)?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/12" class="indent">What would be the implications of variations in this balance for the FCO, others in HMG who help produce the Advice, and its users?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/13" class="indent">How do we link threat level assessments and public information?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/14" class="indent">How far should we take into consideration the capabilities of host governments in reaching decisions on Travel Advice?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/15" class="italic">What are the wider implications of FCO Travel Advice?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/16" class="indent">In responding to a terrorist attack, how can we ensure prudent precaution does not become over-reaction which risks playing into the hands of the terrorists?</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/17" class="italic">Methodology</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/18">During the Review we will consult key stakeholders:</p>
	<p pid=".84WS.2/19" class="indent">Departments within HM Government, including the Home Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department for Transport, the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office;</p>

	<p pid=".86WS.1/1">I am pleased to be able to announce that, today, the UK will ratify the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT) when our permanent representative to the UN will deposit the instrument of ratification with the UN Secretary General.</p>
	<p pid=".86WS.1/2">The UK will become the first member of the European Union and the third country in the world to ratify the Optional Protocol. The UK believes that the Protocol will promote a more intensive and concerted approach to eradicate torture through a preventive system of regular, independent visits to places of detention. We will now undertake a campaign urging other countries to sign, ratify and implement both the Convention Against Torture and the Optional Protocol. The Protocol will come into force when 20 countries have ratified it.</p>
	<p pid=".86WS.1/3">The UK is committed to the fight against torture. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's anti-torture initiative, launched in 1998, continues to provide a focus for us on this issue. The UK played an important role in securing the adoption of the Optional Protocol in 2002 by undertaking extensive lobbying of countries around the world to support the Protocol. The follow-up to our ratification of the OPCAT will be an important part of the current phase of the initiative.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-12-10.87WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1029" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health" colnum="87WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo031210/wmstext/31210m02.htm#31210m02.html_spmin3">
	<p pid=".87WS.1/1">The Department has received new advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) about the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children under the age of 18 for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). An expert working group of the CSM was established earlier this year to look at the safety of the whole class of SSRIs. The group has already advised on paroxetine and the related anti-depressant venlafaxine. They have now concluded that the balance of risks and benefits for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in under 18s is unfavourable for the SSRIs sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram and unassessable for fluvoxamine.</p>
	<p pid=".87WS.1/2">This new advice follows announcements in June and September that paroxetine and venlafaxine should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years to treat depressive illness. Like paroxetine and venlafaxine, none of these drugs has ever been licensed for use in under 18s, but we know they are used in this age group outside licensed indications, where prescribers make a judgment on their own responsibility that it is the right treatment for a particular patient.</p>
	<p pid=".87WS.1/3">Only fluoxetine (Prozac) was shown in clinical trials to have a positive balance of risks and benefits in the treatment of MDD in under 18s. There is no evidence to date to suggest that the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits in adults. The CSM expert group has delivered comprehensive advice on the use of SSRIs in children and young people following a thorough review of all the evidence available. This represents the most detailed review to be completed so far and gives parents, young people and those who treat these serious illnesses the information they need to make informed decisions about treatment. The expert group will now focus their attention on finishing a compete review of the safely of the entire class of medicines in adults and young adults.</p>
	<p pid=".87WS.1/4">Communications to patients and prescribers are taking place today and copies of these materials have been placed in the Library. The benefits of taking these drugs are well established, but we know that some patients suffer significant side effects. Patients over 18 and patients who are benefiting from SSRIs should not be frightened into stopping their medication abruptly. Patients who are experiencing any side effects or are concerned about their treatment should discuss these with their doctor. The Government are committed to ensuring that the wider aspects of suicide prevention remain at the top of the agenda and the National Institute for Mental Health in England has made suicide prevention one of its core policy programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".88WS.2/1">I can now report further progress on the take-up of Pension Credit, which became payable on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-06">6 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".88WS.2/2">There are now 2.06 million pensioner households (over 2.43 million individuals) being paid Pension Credit, including 90,000 new Pension Credit households (over 106,000 individuals) in November. As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-30">30 November</phrase>, there are over 1.37 million households (over 1.61 million individuals) now receiving more money as a result of the introduction of Pension Credit. The Pension Credit Application Line, at our four sites across the country, has received 1.64 million calls since it became operational on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-07">7 April</phrase>, and 96 per cent. of calls have been answered within 30 seconds. Some 490,000 signed applications have been returned to Pension Centres since the campaign began in April. The average Pension Credit award is &pound;46.40 per week.</p>
	<p pid=".88WS.2/3">Our direct mail campaign is continuing, supported by a major advertising campaign on TV and in the press which began in September. We are continuing to work with partner organisations, such as Help The Aged, Age Concern and Citizens Advice, amongst others, both at a national and local level, to encourage eligible people to take up their entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".88WS.2/4">There is plenty of time for pensioners to apply for Pension Credit. To ensure that pensioners do not lose out, there is a twelve month backdating provision until October 2004. This will allow applications to be backdated to October 2003, where entitlement exists, or to the date entitlement begins if this is later.</p>
	<p pid=".88WS.2/5">I am placing in the Library a set of charts and tables showing progress so far, including regional breakdowns of the number of Pension Credit households and numbers of Pension Credit awards in Parliamentary constituencies in Great Britain. Copies are also available for hon. Members in the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid=".88WS.2/6">This is the second of the monthly progress reports on take-up of Pension Credit, which will continue to be provided on a regular basis.</p>
