	<p pid=".30WS.5/1">Further to my statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-24">24 March 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-03-24.885"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 885&ndash;893</phrase>, concerning the disclosure of court papers to the Minister for Children, Young People and Families and with the agreement of my hon. Friend the Baroness Ashton and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families I would like to make a further statement as to how the Government propose to change the law in relation to disclosures to and by members of Parliament of information relating to family court proceedings concerning children.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/2">The Government have concluded that the legislation governing the rules on the disclosure of information relating to family court proceedings concerning children is too restrictive and requires amendment and clarification. The amendments designed to achieve this were tabled to the Children's Bill by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-07">7 October</phrase>. They will, of course, be considered in proceedings on that Bill in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/3">In developing proposals for changes to the law relating to disclosure of information relating to family court proceedings concerning children, policy development has been based on a primary principle of the welfare of the child, supported by four further considerations, which are:</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/4" class="indent">providing for the sharing of information between those with a legitimate need for that information;</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/5" class="indent">the proper functioning of Parliament and the facilitation of the discharge of MPs' and Peers' functions;</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/6" class="indent">the legitimacy of the law, the match between the law and what actually happens; and</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/7" class="indent">the proper administration of justice in family law cases.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/8">The Government's main aim in considering amendments to the law are that the welfare of the child must be the paramount concern. We recognise that parties to family proceedings and others may have a legitimate interest, in limited circumstances, in sharing information. Our broad policy intention is to permit the disclosure of information relating to family proceedings where it is necessary to allow:</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/9" class="indent">parties to a case to obtain appropriate advice and support;</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/10" class="indent">MPs and Peers to undertake their official duties and Ministers to exercise their functions;</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/11" class="indent">statutory agencies, such as the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and Social Services, to obtain access to relevant information for child protection purposes;</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/12" class="indent">complaints to be made to supervisory bodies and investigations to be carried out;</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/13" class="indent">statutory bodies to undertake their regulatory and investigative functions; and approved research to be undertaken.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/14">This list is not exhaustive. Further background is given in the written policy statement which has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses by my hon. Friend the Baroness Ashton and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families which explains the effect of the Government's amendments and sets out the Government's thinking on this issue and their proposed way ahead if the amendments tabled are agreed to by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/15">Briefly, the proposed amendments would do three things. First, they would amend section 97(2) of the Children Act 1989 to limit the criminal offence of publication of information which identifies or is likely to identify a child as being involved in family proceedings, or the address or school of such a child, to publications to the public or section of the public. Secondly, section 12(4) of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 would be clarified to make it clear that where rules of court specify that certain disclosures can be made, such disclosures would not be a contempt of court. Thirdly, a series of amendments would be made to current rule making powers to clarify that rules can be made specifying the circumstances in which disclosures may be made.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.5/16">Hon. Members will recall that I undertook to consult <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/924" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>&mdash;the shadow Attorney-General&mdash;on this matter. I have also consulted <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/765" name="John Burnett">the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett)</phrase>, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on legal affairs. I have also kept the Speaker and the Chairman of the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges informed.</p>

	<p pid=".32WS.2/1">In a written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-30">30 March 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-03-30.88"><i>Official Report,</i> column 88WS</phrase>, the then Minister of State for Work, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/758" name="Des Browne">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne)</phrase>, announced the publication of a partial regulatory impact assessment (RIA) on a proposal to remove the requirement for ELCI from limited companies that employ only their owner (incorporated owners/sole employees). It is estimated that there are about 300,000 such companies.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.2/2">The partial RIA sought the views of employers (in particular incorporated owners/sole traders), insurers and their representative bodies, and other stakeholders (e.g. employees, lawyers) and their representatives, on the proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.2/3">I am pleased to announce the publication on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-06">6 October 2004</phrase> on the DWP website of the summary of responses to that consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.2/4">The majority of respondents to the partial RIA (over 78 per cent.) were in favour of the proposal to remove the requirement for employers' liability compulsory insurance (ELCI) from incorporated owners/sole employees. The majority of business associations, representing large numbers of businesses, were in favour of the change.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.2/5">I have arranged for copies of the summary of responses to be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".32WS.2/6">Amending regulations will be introduced later this year and will come into force early in 2005.</p>
