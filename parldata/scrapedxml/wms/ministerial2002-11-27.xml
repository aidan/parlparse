	<p pid=".22WS.4/1">A review of the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme (SAWS) was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-07">7 February 2002</phrase> in the White Paper on Immigration and Asylum entitled XSecure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain&quot;. Officials within the Home Office have since completed a formal consultation in which the views of a wide range of organisations with an interest in the scheme have been sought.</p>
	<p pid=".22WS.4/2">The Government would like to thank all those who responded to this review. The response of those contributing, many of whom were farmers and growers or their representatives, is that the SAWS plays an important role in providing an additional source of seasonal workers. We have listened to the views expressed and concluded that the scheme should be retained and developed where appropriate with the primary purpose of providing farmers and growers access to seasonal labour.</p>
	<p pid=".22WS.4/3">The use of operators in administering the scheme is felt by the industry to be one of the key strengths of the current arrangements. They play a crucial role in recruiting and allocating participants to farms, overseeing their welfare, and monitoring and evaluating the scheme. Operators will therefore continue to be a feature of the revised SAWS. They will be appointed following a tendering exercise and will be in place in preparation for the revised SAWS which will operate from 2004 onwards.</p>
	<p pid=".22WS.4/4">I am aware that many farmers and growers who have an unmet need for seasonal labour are not within the scope of the existing arrangements. Consequently, the period during which the SAWS operates will be extended beyond the current months of May to November to allow participation in the scheme at any time throughout the year so as to meet the demand for seasonal workers. Additionally the work that SAWS participants are permitted to undertake will be extended, provided it is agricultural work and seasonal in nature. These changes will be fully implemented from January 2004. However, in recognition of the difficulties farmers and growers who are outside the scope of the current arrangements might experience in recruiting seasonal labour next year, I will bring forward these changes for the 2003 SAWS season. This is provided it is within the capacity of the existing operators to handle the additional work, and the employers wishing to benefit are able to meet the welfare needs of participants, in particular the provision of accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".22WS.4/5">In response to these changes the Government will increase the already agreed quota for SAWS 2003 from 20,200 to 25,000. Future quota levels will be determined annually on the basis of an appraisal of the scheme's performance and estimates of future demand by key stakeholders, in particular through scheme operators on behalf of the employers they represent. Although the review found no evidence to support an immediate increase in the quota to 50,000 as recommended by a recent Policy Commission report into the future of food and farming, the Government accept that subject to economic growth demand for seasonal workers will rise steadily in the coming years. It will continue to be a requirement of a revised SAWS that participants must be full-time students in their home country as the review indicated students have an incentive to return home at the end of their time on the scheme. However, the upper age limit of 25 will be removed altogether to enable mature students to benefit from the scheme and to earn money that they can use to fund their education.</p>
	<p pid=".22WS.4/6">I hope these changes will ensure the scheme can continue to make an important contribution to meeting the seasonal labour needs of the agriculture industry and in doing so provide participants with a valuable experience of working in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".26WS.3/1">I have completed the annual review under section 141 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. I propose the following changes to take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-06">6 April 2003</phrase>. These rates and limits will also apply to Northern Ireland National Insurance Contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/2"><i>Employers and Employees</i> In line with the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the Lower Earnings Limit for primary Class 1 contributions is to be raised to &pound;77 a week. It is set at the level of the basic Retirement Pension for a single person from April 2003 and rounded down to the nearest pound.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/3">The Primary and Secondary Thresholds for Class 1 contributions will continue to be aligned with the weekly amount of the income tax personal allowance, which will be frozen from April 2003. The Primary and Secondary Thresholds will therefore remain at &pound;89 a week. This means that no tax or Class 1 contributions will actually be paid on earnings below this level.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/4">The Upper Earnings Limit for primary Class 1 contributions will be raised to &pound;595.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/5"><i>The self-employed</i> The rate of Class 2 contributions will be frozen at &pound;2.00 a week.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/6">Self-employed people with earnings below the annual Small Earnings Exception can apply to be exempted from paying Class 2 contributions. This limit will be raised by &pound;70 to &pound;4,095 in line with inflation.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/7">The annual lower profits limit for liability to Class 4 contributions will remain at &pound;4,615 a year (in line with the income tax personal allowance). The Upper Profits Limit will increase by &pound;520 to &pound;30,940, to maintain the link with employees' earnings liable to Class 1 contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/8">Class 3</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/9">The rate of Class 3 voluntary contributions will be increased by 10 pence to &pound;6.95 a week.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/10"><i>Share fishermen</i> The special rate of Class 2 contributions for share fishermen, which allows them to build entitlement to contributory Jobseekers Allowance in addition to the other contributory benefits available to the self-employed, will remain at &pound;2.65 a week.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/11" class="italic">Volunteer Development Workers</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/12">The special rate of Class 2 contributions for volunteer development workers, which entitles them to the full range of contributory benefits, will be increased by 10 pence to &pound;3.85 in line with the statutory formula of 5 per cent of the primary Class 1 Lower Earnings Limit.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/13"><i>Treasury Grant</i> I need to ensure that the Fund can maintain a prudent working balance throughout the coming year. In accordance with section 2 (2) of the Social Security Act 1993, I propose to do so by prescribing that the maximum Treasury Grant which may be made available to the Fund in 2003&ndash;04 shall not exceed 2 per cent of the estimated benefit expenditure for that year. Similar provision will be made in respect of the Northern Ireland National Insurance Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".26WS.3/14">I shall be laying a draft re-rating order before Parliament in due course. This will accompany a report by the Government Actuary to myself and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions which we shall jointly present to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".30WS.8/1">I am pleased to inform hon. Members that I published on <phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase> a consultation document proposing a strategic framework for the future of the offshore wind industry.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/2">This country is very rich in wind resources. Harnessing the wind to generate electricity means that we have a sustainable and secure long term supply of energy. An important added benefit is that generating electricity from the wind does not release carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere. The wind energy industry is well established onshore and single turbines and larger wind farms are already generating electricity for homes and businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/3">The wind resource out at sea is substantial and offers considerable potential for expansion of the wind energy industry. The offshore wind energy industry could make a significant contribution, perhaps as much as 50%, to meeting the Government's target that 10% of electricity supplies should be generated from renewable sources by 2010. Expansion on this scale would bring significant investment and job opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".30WS.8/4">The first step in realising this potential has already been taken when in December 2000 the Crown Estate invited the industry to apply for site leases for wind farms. The response was most encouraging. 20 wind farms are planned for various locations around the coast The first of these wind farms is expected to be constructed next year.</p>

	<p pid=".35WS.2/1">In October, Kent County Council and Medway Council applied for a judicial review of the Government's decision not to include any options for new runways at Gatwick airport in the consultation on airport capacity. The Government had taken that decision after careful consideration of various factors, including our conclusion that it would be wrong to seek to overturn the legal agreement entered into by West Sussex County Council and BAA (then in government ownership), preventing construction of a further runway at Gatwick before 2019.</p>
	<p pid=".35WS.2/2">Yesterday, Mr Justice Maurice Kay held that the Government were wrong not to have included any options for new runways at Gatwick. However, the Court granted permission for the Government to appeal against this decision. Having considered the matter, I believe it would be wrong to extend the uncertainty that would inevitably result from a lengthy appeal process, and so I have therefore decided to accept the judgment. As a result we will include Gatwick in the consultation. This will regrettably mean that the publication of the White Paper will be delayed.</p>
	<p pid=".35WS.2/3">I will make a further statement setting out how we intend to proceed shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".36WS.2/1">Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate the Department for International Development DEL for 2002/2003 will be increased by &pound;37,437,000 from &pound;3,339,521,000 to &pound;3,376,958,000. Within the DEL change, the impact on resources and capital are as set out in the following table:</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.2/2">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from:</p>

	<p pid=".36WS.4/1">The purpose of the public-private partnership for CDC is to maximise the creation and long-term growth of viable businesses in poorer developing countries, by making responsible investments and mobilising private capital alongside public funds. These objectives have remained constant since the 1997 and 2000 White Papers on International Development. CDC has made good progress in implementing the Investment Policy agreed in 1999, raising private finance and co-financing for investments in poorer countries, and introducing private sector disciplines. This has been achieved in some of the most difficult markets and economic conditions for many years.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.4/2">In order to support CDC's progress and the mobilisation of increased private investment in poorer developing countries, I have recently approved two further proposals. Firstly, CDC's business will focus more sharply on regions (South Asia and Africa) and on sectors (power, Small and Medium Enterprises, and infrastructure) that are priorities for DFID and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Following a review commissioned by the Board earlier this year, CDC is already implementing a new business plan approved by its Board, focusing on these areas. Secondly, CDC will be reorganised, separating into two corporate entities and a family of Funds:-</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.4/3" class="indent">an Investment Company (the existing CDC, with some amendments to its Articles), which would continue to own the cash and investment assets of CDC and its subsidiaries. The Investment Company will remain wholly-owned by the Government during the reorganisation, and will be responsible for ensuring that HMG's capital adheres to CDC's Investment Policy.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.4/4" class="indent">a new Management Company will be formed during 2003, subject to regulatory and other procedures being completed. The Management Company will raise and invest capital from the Investment Company, other Development Finance Institutions and private investors, following responsible business principles and providing leadership and supervision of a family of Funds.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.4/5" class="indent">The initial Funds will include Funds for Africa, South Asia, the power sector and the SME sector. Each Fund will be managed by a dedicated fund management subsidiary of the Management Company. The new Funds will be run on a commercial basis that attracts capital from private investors and Development Finance Institutions, to meet the Governments objective of increasing investment in poorer developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.4/6">The structure of a management company and a family of Funds is an accepted norm in the international fund management industry. The advantages of adopting this structure in CDC are as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.4/7" class="indent">Each Fund would have its own focus and investment strategy, target rate of return, risk profile and other characteristics. Potential private investors will be able to identify Funds that fit into their own investment strategies. The structure also enables specialised managers to be allocated to each Fund, and for incentives to be directly linked to individual Fund performance. Under current management arrangements, there is no competition for the management of CDC's capital. In the medium term, the Investment Company will be able to procure investment management services on a competitive basis, and to invest in Funds launched by other companies as well as by the Management Company. The reorganisation will therefore lead to a more competitive market for the management of investments in poorer developing countries. The Government have concluded that, under current market conditions, we cannot obtain value for money from a sale of shares in CDC Group pic as currently constituted. We are currently exploring with our advisers an appropriate corporate and shareholding structure for the Management Company and its subsidiaries, including the possible participation of private institutions and employees. In the long term, it is possible that equity in the Investment Company could also be offered for sale, when the right conditions obtain.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.4/8">The Investment Policy will remain broadly unchanged. The CDC Universe will apply to both the Investment Company and the Management Company, as will the responsible business principles. The requirements that 70 per cent. of investments should be for poorer developing countries, and 50 per cent. for sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, will apply to the Investment Company's capital but not to third party capital. The 50 per cent. target for sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia will no longer be an &quot;aim&quot;, but will be placed on the same mandatory basis over five-year rolling periods as the 70 per cent. target.</p>
	<p pid=".36WS.4/9">I have informed the Select Committee of these proposals, which I believe will enable CDC to mobilise increased investment in the poorer developing countries, and make a stronger contribution to our goal of eliminating poverty.</p>
