	<p pid="a.16WS.1/1">The Prime Minister's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-07-25.83WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 83WS</phrase>, announced a machinery of Government change moving responsibility for defence trade promotion from the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) to UK Trade and Investment (UKTI). Today I am announcing the arrangements under which this transfer will take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.1/2">This statement is made in close consultation with my colleagues the Secretary of State for Defence, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.1/3">We fully recognise how important continued export success is to the health of this strategic sector of the economy. Defence equipment manufacture is highly important to the United Kingdom. The combination of expertise within both DESO and UKTI offers a major opportunity to enhance the way HM Government offer support to this successful industry. The ability to offer a complete package for prospective customer Governments, who often seek specialist assistance, will help the industry develop a compelling market proposition that positions the UK uniquely in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.1/4">The new organisation will build on the sector's recent work which has produced a code setting out common standards of good business practice. We will work together to promote strong standards of business conduct and corporate governance in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.1/5">The new organisation will be the UKTI Defence and Security Group. This is a working name. The group will be a UKTI business unit with expertise in defence services and products, operating under the UKTI brand and to UKTI strategic objectives. Ministerial responsibility will rest with the Minister of State for Trade and Investment. The group will be accountable to the UKTI board and its head will report to UKTI's chief executive. Its head will be selected through open competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.1/6">UKTI Defence and Security Group will have continued links to the MOD, in support of defence objectives. This will involve the active engagement of Defence Ministers, and the loan from the MOD to UKTI (via the Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR)) of armed forces and relevant civilian personnel to the group. Certain other civilian personnel will transfer from the MOD to UKTI (via BERR), and staff employed locally at overseas missions will transfer from MOD employment to UKTI (via the Foreign and Commonwealth Office).</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.1/7">The current export licensing function within the Defence Export Services Organisation will be retained within the MOD and so be separate from export support activities. And within BERR the separation between BERR export licence functions and trade promotion in UKTI will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.1/8">In line with the Prime Minister's statement, no changes are envisaged to existing and planned agreements between the MOD and other Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.16WS.1/9">An implementation plan is in place. As a machinery of government change, the guiding principle is that business planning assumptions, and staffing and resources, will be taken on at their current levels from DESO by UKTI. This transfer to UKTI will take place on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-11a.17WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" speakeroffice="The Minister for Energy" colnum="17WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/wmstext/71211m0001.htm#07121145000327">
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/1">I represented the UK at the Energy Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/2">The Council was dominated by exchanges on progress on the internal market. There was a positive outcome from a UK perspective, with growing support for ownership unbundling. The rest of the meeting was taken up by a policy debate on the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan and information from the presidency and Commission on international relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/3">On the SET plan, Ministers debated the recently adopted Commission communication and an associated presidency 'vision statement'. The presidency said it was important the EU took a lead internationally to meet climate goals&mdash;the cost of inaction was greater than action. Investment in the development of energy technologies would be critical but there was no single solution&mdash;a wide range of technologies was needed. The Commission outlined the content of their communication. To meet our long-term climate objectives the EU had to be ambitious both on its own and in promoting greater international cooperation.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/4">While welcoming the communication, member states demonstrated a wide range of views on the appropriate prescription, particularly when it came to identifying the most important technologies; energy efficiency was the most mentioned sector. There was general agreement on the need for more effective investment in R&amp;D and the importance of the private sector. For the UK, I emphasised the need to translate the plan into early action; referring to the recent UK tender for demonstration of carbon capture and storage I underlined the importance of addressing policy and regulatory barriers to developing and demonstrating new energy technologies. The Commission emphasised the need to prioritise action.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/5">Presenting the Third Internal Market Package, the Commission noted that while liberalisation had brought benefits, competitive markets were not yet complete. To meet the spring European Council mandate, real change was necessary to ensure non-discriminatory access, open and transparent markets, incentives to invest, and to improve the powers and independence of regulators. On the key issue of unbundling, the Commission noted that unbundled markets had experienced lower price rises (6 per cent. as against 29 per cent.) and higher investment. Though the Commission was open to considering alternatives, these had to involve structural separation that ensured the independence of the Transmission System Operator. The Commission called for swift progress in Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/6">All member states welcomed the presidency progress report as fair and balanced. The presidency noted the broad consensus on regulators' powers, objectives and independence as well as the need for greater co-operation, though not yet on the proposed agency model itself, and called on those member states wanting a third option on unbundling to present it soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/7">For the UK, I supported the Commission's analysis that full ownership unbundling was the best way to deliver the necessary network investment and benefits of a competitive market to EU consumers and business as UK experience demonstrated. I emphasised the importance of rapid progress, noting that any third option would have to meet the spring European Council mandate on effective separation of networks from supply/generation activities to ensure independent decisions on investment. I also recognised the special circumstances faced by small or isolated markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/8">A large majority of member states supported the UK position in whole or in part. Several others supported the agency while others emphasised the importance of the third country clause.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/9">Two member states in particular, supported by four others, rejected functional separation of networks and supply as a solution to the problem, seeing networks as a natural monopoly. They believed it caused problems for safety, investment, quality and prices, as well as weakening EU operators' positions against third country companies. They would suggest an ambitious alternative solution next year. The Commission concluded by emphasising that the purpose was to promote the interests of EU consumers, not the energy industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/10">On International Relations, the presidency reported on a variety of initiatives, focusing on Brazil and Africa in particular. Energy was now an important component of most EU external relations, for example with China, India and the EuroMed. The Commission agreed and noted the good progress made across the board. On Russia, they would investigate the impact of the third package on Russian companies and they would soon propose modalities for the accession of Moldova, Ukraine, Norway and Turkey to the Energy Community Treaty. The proposed Energy Efficiency Platform, in lieu of an international agreement, was also important; the Commission was looking at ways of supporting its development.</p>
	<p pid="a.17WS.1/11">Two member states raised their interest in pipeline developments. The Commission's co-ordinator for the Nabucco pipeline reported on this project.</p>

	<p pid="a.19WS.1/1">The Government are today publishing Simplification Plans for 19 Departments and Government agencies. The Health and Safety Executive published its plan on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December</phrase>, taking the total number of plans published to 20.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.1/2">The plans set out more than 700 initiatives which, when delivered, will result in reduced administrative burdens and policy costs for the UK economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.1/3">They show how the Government are delivering the commitment they made 12 months ago to reduce administrative burdens on business and the third sector by 25 per cent. net by 2010, saving the economy &pound;3.5 billion a year. They set out 288 simplification measures that Departments have delivered to date, saving business and the third sector more than &pound;800 million net per year. And they show that work has begun on reducing the bureaucracy faced by frontline public sector workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.1/4">These plans continue the Government's commitment to transparent reporting of its simplification programme. Departments will continue to update plans annually in order to ensure on-going year-on-year reductions in the burdens they impose.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.1/5">A report &quot;Delivering simplification plans: A summary&quot; has been deposited in both Houses which summarises this cross-Government effort.</p>

	<p pid="a.22WS.2/1">The National Contingency Plan for Exotic Animal Diseases was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">Monday 10 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/2">This Plan sets out the operational arrangements Defra will put in place to deal with any occurrence of foot and mouth disease, avian influenza or Newcastle disease. The plan is also applicable to other exotic animal diseases. It is composed of two elements: Defra's Framework Response Plan for Exotic Animal Diseases, outlining systems, structures, roles and responsibilities during an outbreak of disease, and Defra's Overview of Emergency Preparedness which provides details of our preparedness and operational response.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/3">It replaces Defra's Exotic Animal Disease Generic Contingency Plan which was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-13">13 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.2/4">Defra's Contingency Plan is very much a &quot;living document&quot;. It will be subject to ongoing revision taking on the latest developments in science, research, and epidemiological modelling together with lessons identified from outbreaks.</p>

	<p pid="a.26WS.2/1">Leaders from the European Union and Africa met in Lisbon on 8 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-09">9 December</phrase> at the second EU Africa summit to agree new co-operation and a framework for a closer partnership between the two continents. The agenda was wide covering peace and security, governance and human rights, trade, infrastructure and development, energy and climate change and migration. The main themes to emerge discussions focused on governance and trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.26WS.2/2">The UK had made its position clear that the Prime Minister would not participate if President Mugabe attended. Baroness Amos ably represented the UK and promoted key aims.</p>
	<p pid="a.26WS.2/3">The UK commitment to the relationship between African and the European Union is clear. We supported the summit and have been working hard with partners in the course of this year to prepare for successful discussions and agreements. We welcome the fact that leaders were able to discuss and reach agreement on urgent global challenges including the need to accelerate progress towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals in Africa, tackling conflict and climate change, and promoting good governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.26WS.2/4">European leaders at the summit rightly highlighted the links between governance and development and focused particularly on the human rights situations in Zimbabwe and Darfur, and the serious challenge to Africa's development that they represent. Baroness Amos raised Zimbabwe and the appalling human rights situation caused by President Mugabe during her intervention. African leaders too spoke up on the need to tackle poor governance and safeguard human rights and the links to growth promotion and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.26WS.2/5">The trading relationship between the European Union and African countries and regions formed an important part of discussions, with some African countries expressing concerns about the new Economic Partnership Agreements. Many African countries have now signed or initialled interim agreements with the Commission. The Commission underscored the importance of concluding such agreements, particularly for non-least developed countries, in order to safeguard trade flows. It agreed to schedule further discussions with the leaders from the five African regions in the new year to take stock of the situation and discuss the way forward. The UK continues to encourage those countries which have yet to sign an interim agreement to do so to avoid damaging trade disruption. We also consider it vital that no country should be worse off and that when full economic partnership agreements are negotiated, they promote development objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.26WS.2/6">The summit aimed to forge a stronger partnership between Africa and Europe. Leaders agreed a joint strategy, and a series of action plans that set out specific commitments over the next three years. These new agreements build on many of the commitments made: at Gleneagles and at the December 2005 European Council held under the UK presidency. &quot;EU Africa Partnerships&quot; setting out co-operation and targets have been agreed under eight headings; the millennium development goals; good governance and human rights; peace and security; climate change; energy; trade and integration; migration; and science.</p>
	<p pid="a.26WS.2/7">The UK will continue to work closely with EU and African partners to ensure that commitments made in Lisbon are honoured and concrete progress is made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-11a.27WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1826" speakername="David Miliband" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs" colnum="27WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071211/wmstext/71211m0002.htm#07121145000335">
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-07">7 December</phrase>, representatives of the Contact Group submitted to the UN Secretary-General the report by the EU-Russia-US troika on their work aimed at achieving a negotiated settlement for Kosovo's future status.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/2">The troika correctly set themselves the objective of &quot;leaving no stone unturned&quot; in the search for an outcome mutually acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. During the four months of their mandate, the troika undertook an intense schedule of meetings with the parties. Over ten rounds of negotiations&mdash;including six sets of direct talks, one of them in extended conference format&mdash;the parties considered options covering the spectrum from independence, autonomy, confederation, partition and a status-neutral approach. One or other of the parties rejected all these options.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/3">The troika have therefore reported that the parties have been unable to reach an agreement on Kosovo's status.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/4">I pay tribute to the troika's work. They have worked tirelessly and imaginatively. Although they did not secure an agreement between the parties, their work generated sustained and intensive high-level dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. The troika have also been able to extract important commitments from the parties, including pledges to refrain from actions that might jeopardise the security situation in Kosovo or elsewhere and not to use violence, threats or intimidation. These are important commitments to which we shall expect both sides to adhere strictly in the period ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/5">The troika's efforts followed those of UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari who laboured heroically for 14 months to reach agreement between the parties before concluding that this was out of reach. He therefore drew up his own proposal for how to move forward based around the concept of supervised independence. That recommendation was supported by the EU, US and UN Secretary-General. It was rejected by Serbia and Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/6">It is hard to argue now that there is any value in further negotiations or that serious options have yet to be fully explored. The failure to reach agreement is not because of lack of time, energy or imagination on the part of the international community. It is because the positions of the parties are irreconcilable. Kosovo insists on independence. Serbia insists on a settlement that locks the door on any prospect of independence. The UK shares the firm view of the EU representative on the troika, Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger, that the parties would not be capable of reaching agreement on this issue if negotiations were to be continued, whether in the troika format, or in some other form.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/7">The Kosovo status process has now reached a decisive moment, presenting the international community with difficult but important decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/8">One point on which almost all in the international community are agreed is that the status quo is unsustainable. This was stated in clear terms by the UN Secretary-General when he addressed the Contact Group Ministerial meeting in September in New York. The Contact Group, including Russia, subsequently expressed their agreement in a joint Ministerial statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/9">The international community cannot therefore allow the status process to grind to a halt or to be shuffled off into a siding by convening further fruitless negotiations. We learned to our cost in the 1990s the heavy human and political price attached to an indecisive international response to looming problems in the Western Balkans. The stability and security of part of Europe is at stake. It is essential that we respond in a decisive and far-sighted manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/10">The UK's preference would be for a settlement to be supported by the passage of a resolution of the UN Security Council. We believe there should be further rapid consultations in New York to this end before the end of 2007. However in the absence of agreement between the parties, we need to be realistic about the slim prospects of securing the necessary level of consensus in the Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/11">Against this background it is important that the EU demonstrates its readiness to meet its responsibilities and objectives in respect of stability and security in Europe. Securing a viable and sustainable future for Kosovo is a major responsibility for the EU. The effectiveness and cohesiveness of the EU's common foreign and security policy will be judged against our ability to deliver on this responsibility. The EU must demonstrate firm resolve to bring the status process through to completion and play a leading role subsequently in implementing a settlement. I welcome the fact that the EU is already intensively engaged in the necessary preparations to meet these responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/12">In moving towards a Kosovo settlement, it will be necessary for the EU and others to take a strategic approach answering to a series of key challenges. There will be a need to ensure Kosovo's security. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is already deployed in strength in Kosovo to maintain a safe and secure environment. The EU has indicated a readiness to provide a European Security and Defence Policy policing/rule of law mission. The EU should deliver on this commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/13">There will be a need to ensure good governance in Kosovo. The proposal of the UN Special Envoy provides a good basis for this. The provisions it set out for the internal governance of Kosovo, and the allocation of responsibilities it contains, must be the foundation for how we deliver security and help Kosovo improve its ability to meet European standards. The EU should be ready to play a major part in settlement implementation including through the appointment of an EU Special Representative and through contributing to an International Civilian Office in Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/14">There will be a need to achieve certainty and permanence in respect of Kosovo's future status. Again, the UK believes that the proposal of the UN Special Envoy for supervised independence provides a good basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/15">There will be a need to look beyond the immediate challenge of resolving Kosovo's future status. Following a settlement, Kosovo will face formidable economic and state-building challenges. The international community&mdash;with the EU to the fore&mdash;will need to be ready to meet this challenge, including through the swift convening of a donors' conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.27WS.1/16">Finally, there will be a need to address the regional dimension. The UK recognises that moving through this phase will be difficult for Serbia, as well as for other countries in the region. The EU must be clear and far-sighted in its commitment to helping them meet European standards and so move farther towards eventual accession. There is a compelling strategic case for enlargement to the Western Balkans so that this troubled region can share in the security, stability and prosperity that the EU offers. The EU needs to take forward this agenda vigorously in the months ahead.</p>
