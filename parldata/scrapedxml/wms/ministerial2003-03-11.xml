	Asylum Seekers (Language Analysis)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-03-11.7WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/980" speakername="Beverley Hughes" speakeroffice="The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration" colnum="7WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030311/wmstext/30311m01.htm#30311m01.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".7WS.2/1">In the light of concern that some asylum applicants from other countries are posing falsely as nationals from Iraq, we have decided to pilot language analysis testing for use in cases where appropriate when a person claiming Iraqi nationality applies for asylum. Language testing arrangements in such cases will start on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-12">12 March 2003</phrase> and continue for an initial period of one month.</p>
	<p pid=".7WS.2/2">The purpose of language analysis is to provide expert evidence which helps to identify the place of origin of asylum seekers. Language analysis is used in a number of European countries, and the results have been generally successful. In the UK language analysis has been used already in the case of asylum claims made by nationals claiming to be from Afghanistan, Somalia or Sri Lanka. It was found to be a valuable aid in the asylum consideration process, clearly identifying in many instances that the applicant was not of the nationality he or she claimed to be, or not from the area of the country from which they claimed to originate. Language analysis also benefited genuine applicants by confirming the information they gave about their nationality.</p>
	<p pid=".7WS.2/3">The extension of language testing to nationals from Iraq is being given legal effect today by an authorisation made by myself under section 19D of the Race Relations Act 1976. Where there are objective reasons for doubting the nationality of a person claiming to be from Iraq, the authorisation will enable staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to request the applicant to undertake a further interview which will be taped and sent to a language expert for analysis. Individuals may refuse to consent to this further interview (which will be conducted at the initial screening stage), but this refusal can be taken into account when determining whether the applicant has established the facts of their case. This may lead to their claim being refused.</p>
	<p pid=".7WS.2/4">We will review the need for this further authorisation later in the year. Independent scrutiny of the likely effect of authorisations made by Ministers and how they are operated in practice by officials is exercised by the race monitor, Mary Coussey, who reports to Parliament via the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".7WS.2/5">A copy of the addition authorisation has been place in the Library of the House. Any additional or amended authorisations will also be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".8WS.2/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister consulted last year on proposals to amend and consolidate the Accounts and Audit Regulations, which set out the duties of local authorities on the keeping of accounts. The three-month consultation period provided for in our consultation came to an end in December. Having carefully considered representations made, I have today laid the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003 (SI 2003 No. 533), to implement the changes. The aims of the amendments are to update the rules governing the way local authorities keep accounts, to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy so the accounting burden is proportionate to the size of the authority, and to make improvements to provisions relating to local authority corporate governance and accountability. Various changes have been made to the original proposals to reflect the concerns of consultees. The regulations will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>. Guidance will be issued to assist authorities in implementing the regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".8WS.4/1">I am pleased to announce the Government's acceptance of all the recommendations of the Advisory Panel on Standards (APOS) for the Planning Inspectorate Agency, as set out in their Ninth Annual Report published in November 2002. APOS jointly advises the First Secretary of State and the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government on the maintenance and improvement of quality standards for the planning inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid=".8WS.4/2">The panel's main finding was that the demanding quality standard target, that 99 per cent. of the Inspectorate's casework should be free from justified complaints, was being maintained. However, the panel also made a number of recommendations on steps that could be taken to further enhance quality standards. These included improvements to training and procedures, that have already been implemented, and the introduction of arrangements to correct simple errors within decision letters which is included in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill currently before Parliament. The remaining recommendations are all part of a continuous process of training, development and monitoring, such as the introduction of a rolling customer satisfaction survey, to build on the experiences of users of the system.</p>
	<p pid=".8WS.4/3">I am particularly pleased to note the Panel's comments on the good work of the Inspectorate in encouraging diversity within the organisation, in promoting training interchange schemes to develop staff and in encouraging electronic access to information for the public and other interested parties through its planning portal project. These initiatives are playing an important part in the Government's wider initiative to promote planning as a positive instrument and to involve the community more effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".8WS.4/4">I commend the work of the panel and thank them for their helpful recommendations, and look forward to seeing further results of their hard work over the next year.</p>

	<p pid=".9WS.4/2">A number of primary care trusts were also established during the year. Public dividend capital is not required for the establishment of new primary care trusts as they are subject to a different financial regime. Net assets transferred from dissolving NHS trusts to primary care trusts are reflected in the general fund of the primary care trust.</p>

	Non-Producing Milk Quota Holders
</minor-heading>

	<p pid=".9WS.7/1">The ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Thomsen case has important implications for UK dairy farmers. It means that quota holders who do not produce against their quota for one year will have it confiscated to the national reserve. In effect, non-producing milk quota holders (NPQHs) will no longer be able to hold quota. Leasing out of quota will not be enough to avoid confiscation.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.7/2">There has understandably been considerable interest in the timetable for implementation of the ruling in the UK. I can confirm that the new rules will apply from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. Accordingly, NPQHs who have not produced against their quota in 2003&ndash;04 will be allowed until <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> to sell it. If they do not do so by that date, it will be confiscated to the national reserve. During the 2003&ndash;04 quota year NPQHs may lease out quota if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.7/3">Currently, NPQHs who lose their quota may apply for its restoration within 6 years of confiscation if they resume active production. However, under current EC proposals this period may be reduced to two years.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.7/4">In association with this, we shall be going out to consultation later in the year on the possible introduction of a 70 per cent usage rule. Under such a rule producers who do not use at least 70 per cent of their quota over a period to be fixed would have all or part of the unused portion confiscated to the national reserve. The introduction of such a rule would depend on the outcome of the consultation exercise. Subject to final confirmation of the legal base, we also propose to consult on breaking the link between quota and land, which will make it easier for tenants to buy in their own right any quota released by NPQHs.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.7/5">We recognise that the change concerning NPQHs is an important one and have publicised the new rules widely, including sending individual letters to all NPQHs. We believe that we have put in place a fair transitional arrangement that both allows NPQHs a reasonable period of time to adjust to the new circumstances and also recognises the UK's obligations under Community law.</p>

	<p pid=".11WS.2/1">Later today, I intend to launch a public consultation process on proposals for reform of water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".11WS.2/2">Since assuming responsibility for the Regional Development Ministerial portfolio, I have been acutely aware of the need for massive investment in Northern Ireland's water and sewerage infrastructure. Such a step-change in long-term investment can only be achieved through the development of secure, self-financing arrangements which also address the needs of the public as fairly and efficiently as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".11WS.2/3">In principle, this will require the introduction of domestic water charges in tandem with structural reform of the delivery of water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland to ensure that people will not be asked to pay more than is absolutely necessary. I am committed to full and inclusive consultation through which I believe arrangements for the delivery of water and sewerage services, tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the people of Northern Ireland, can be developed.</p>
	<p pid=".11WS.2/4">The Consultation Paper which I have published today sets out a range of possible options for domestic water charging. Possible structural arrangements for water and sewerage delivery and business models for a reformed Water Service are also outlined, along with the associated issues of economic and consumer regulation and mechanisms for consumer representation on water issues.</p>
	<p pid=".11WS.2/5">The period of public consultation on these issues will run until June 2003. Following a period of assessment of the responses to the consultation document, detailed proposals will be brought forward for further public consultation in the autumn, ultimately leading into the production of appropriate legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".12WS.2/1">A consultation on the future of public sector Ombudsman services in Wales began in November last year when the First Minister of the National Assembly for Wales and I published &quot;Ombudsmen's Services in Wales: Time for change?&quot;. That document invited views on a proposal to bring together the offices of Welsh Administration Ombudsman, Health Service Commission Wales and the Commissioner for Local Administration in Wales to create a unified Ombudsman's jurisdiction for Wales, led by a single individual. We undertook to consult further on the precise remit of the new office if the principle of a single jurisdiction was endorsed.</p>
	<p pid=".12WS.2/2">I can announce that responses to the consultation have given the proposal for a single Ombudsman's jurisdiction in Wales almost unanimous support.
