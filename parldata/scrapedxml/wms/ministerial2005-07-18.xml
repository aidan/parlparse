	<p pid=".47WS.2/1">I will chair the agriculture items during the first Agriculture and Fisheries Council of the UK presidency on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July</phrase>. My hon. Friend, the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Bradshaw), will chair the fisheries item.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/2">I will begin by setting out the presidency work programme for the next six months. It includes amongst other things, sugar reform, the EU's rural development strategic guidelines, forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT), avian influenza, welfare of broiler chickens and a range of proposals to progress the sustainability of the fisheries industry.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/3">The Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection will then present to the Council his proposal for a directive laying down minimum rules for the protection of chickens kept for meat production.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/4">The Fisheries Commissioner will follow with the only fisheries point on the agenda: emergency measures to protect anchovy in the Bay of Biscay, referred to the Council by France.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/5">The Agriculture Commissioner will then present the EU strategic guidelines on rural development. This is simply a presentation of the proposal to the Council with no discussion at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/6">There will be a lunch at which the Agriculture Commissioner will provide an update on WTO agricultural negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/7">The afternoon session will be devoted to the first Council policy debate on reform of the common market organisation in sugar, following the publication of the Commission's reform proposal on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-22">22 June</phrase>. Ministers will be invited to respond to the following questions:</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/8" class="indent">Is the voluntary restructuring scheme combined with a larger price cut preferable to a smaller price cut and mandatory quota cuts as proposed in the Commission communication of July 2004?</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/9" class="indent">Do you support a reform that gives a long-term perspective by lasting until the 2014&ndash;15 marketing year?</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/10" class="indent">Are the Commission proposals for compensation fair and balanced in line with recent CAP reforms?</p>
	<p pid=".47WS.2/11">There is only one point under any other business at the request of the Dutch delegation on definition of fresh poultry meat and origin labelling.</p>

	<p pid=".49WS.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase> I made a statement on the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe and on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July</phrase> I updated the House on that issue. I would like to provide a further update on returns to Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.6/2">Our policy on enforcing the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe has not changed. We remain of the view that the correct way to operate a fair but credible asylum system is to consider each asylum claim on its individual merits, to grant protection to those who need it, and to seek to remove those who do not and who have no other basis of stay in the country, and who will not leave voluntarily. This is true of all claims, whatever the nationality of the claimant.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.6/3">The courts have set a hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase> to consider the evidence provided by the Refugee Legal Centre relating to the treatment of failed asylum seekers upon their return to Zimbabwe. We welcome the opportunity this will provide for all the objective information relating to their treatment to be assessed. Pending the <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-04">4 August</phrase> hearing, out of respect and courtesy to the clearly expressed wishes of the court, we have agreed not to enforce the removal of Zimbabwean failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".49WS.6/4">This Government continue to have grave concerns about the human rights situation in Zimbabwe, and continue to press for an end to abuses. We will continue to provide protection through the asylum system for Zimbabweans with a well founded fear of persecution.</p>
