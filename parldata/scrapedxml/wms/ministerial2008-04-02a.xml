<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-04-02a.49WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1483" speakername="Kevin Brennan" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families" colnum="49WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/wmstext/80402m0001.htm#08040249000292">
	<p pid="a.49WS.5/1">I am today announcing the outcome of a review of the suspension of adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.5/2">In June 2004, the then Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" name="Margaret Hodge">the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase>, announced the suspension of adoptions in response to concerns raised and investigated by officials from the DfES (now DCSF) who visited Cambodia, by the British Embassy in Cambodia and, separately, by other stakeholders about the intercountry adoption process in Cambodia.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.5/3">A review of the suspension was announced last year and was carried out by my Department. The purpose of the review was to update the information on which the suspension was based, to find out what concerns, if any, remain valid and whether there are any other concerns about practices taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.5/4">The review work assessed the current situation in Cambodia regarding intercountry adoption, including what changes, if any, to practice and legislation have been made in the three years since the temporary suspension was introduced. The review also took account of Cambodia's accession to the Hague Convention (on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993).</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.5/5">On <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>, the UK lodged an objection to Cambodia's accession to the Hague Convention, in accordance with article 44 of the convention. Cambodia's accession to the convention therefore has no effect as regards relations between the UK and Cambodia.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.5/6">Evidence from the review demonstrates that: adoption legislation, practice and procedure in Cambodia remain insufficient to ensure the proper protection of children and their families; lifting the suspension at the current time would expose Cambodian children and their families to an increased risk of improper practices that are contrary to the principles of the Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Hague Convention) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.5/7">The suspension of adoptions of Cambodian children by UK residents therefore still remains in place. I will of course consider the effect of any changes to adoption legislation and practice in Cambodia in keeping the suspension under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.5/8">I am also announcing today the outline timetable for the implementation of the statutory provisions relating to the restrictions of adoptions from abroad in the Children and Adoption Act 2002. I intend to implement sections 9 and 10 and, in so far as they are not already in force, sections 11 and 12 of the 2006 Act in summer 2008.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-04-02a.62WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice" colnum="62WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/wmstext/80402m0003.htm#08040249000303">
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">Wednesday, 9 April</phrase>, I will publish a consultation document about the introduction of a Best Value system into probation. The consultation period will run until <phrase class="date" code="">2 July 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/2">During the passage of the Offender Management Bill last year, the Government signalled a move away from a target-based regime in which probation areas had to outsource a proportion of their work to a model based on the principles of best value. In discussion with interested parties, we have drawn up a proposed model for how Best Value would work and we are now consulting publicly on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/3">The proposed Best Value model would apply to all services funded by probation boards and trusts. It would enable boards and trusts to demonstrate, in a transparent way, the value for money of their services, and to drive improvements in the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of their service delivery. Best Value reviews would be based around five areas&mdash;consult, compare, challenge, collaborate and, where appropriate, compete. The reviews may result in the competition of services, but only if they have shown that that would be the most efficient and effective delivery option; the Best Value process is neutral as to the final result. By delivering efficiency savings, Best Value will provide value for money to the taxpayer and, by improving the effectiveness of service delivery to offenders, it will contribute towards our aim of reducing reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.1/4">Copies of the consultation document will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies will also be available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office and on the internet at: <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/consultations.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/consultations.htm</a></p>
