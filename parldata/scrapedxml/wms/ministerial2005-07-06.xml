<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-06.9WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="9WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050706/wmstext/50706m01.htm#50706m01.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".9WS.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase> I made a statement on the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe and I would now like to update the House on returns to Zimbabwe and on the situation of those who are currently refusing food.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.5/2">As I set out in my previous statement, the Home Office assesses cases on their individual merits, providing protection to those who need it and seeking to remove from the UK those who do not. Each case is considered thoroughly before removal proceeds and any new information or representations are examined accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.5/3">There have also been reports in the media of alleged ill-treatment of those who have been returned to Zimbabwe. We do not routinely monitor the treatment of individuals once removed from the UK as I made clear in my earlier statement. But our assessment of the situation on the ground is constantly monitored from a wide variety of sources, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, media reports and UK Government contacts with NGOs on the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July</phrase> there were 106 Zimbabweans being detained across the removal estate, 33 of whom have refused four or more consecutive meals. Food is available to all hunger strikers and they are seen daily by a medical practitioner to check their condition. None of them has been hospitalised at this stage.</p>
	<p pid=".9WS.5/5">As I stated before we shall also continue our efforts, bilaterally and with our international partners, to press the Government of Zimbabwe to end human rights abuses and restore democracy and the rule of law, so that all Zimbabweans can return safely to help build a prosperous and stable country.</p>
