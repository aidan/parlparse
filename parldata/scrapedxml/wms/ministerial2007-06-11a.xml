	<p pid="a.33WS.2/1">The Government have launched a website where Explanatory Memoranda (EMs) on EU documents submitted to Parliament under the long-established EU scrutiny arrangements can be consulted and downloaded.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/2">Although Government EMs have previously been accessible in hard copy form through the British Library, the new website will help to promote a greater transparency of and access to the information submitted by the Government to Parliament on proposals for EU legislation and other EU documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/3">The website can be found at <a href="http://europeanmemorandum.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/search.asp">http://europeanmemorandum.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/search.asp</a>x&gt;</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/4">The site will enable users to:</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/5" class="indent">Access all Government EMs on EU documents submitted to Parliament from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/6" class="indent">Download EMs, contact details are provided for further information. The Cabinet Office stores earlier EMs electronically dating back to 2003 and can be contacted for copies of earlier EMs.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/7" class="indent">Find out information about the United Kingdom's procedures for Parliamentary scrutiny of EU documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/8" class="indent">Use links to the websites of the House of Lords European Union Committee and the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee as well as to sites where EU Council of Ministers and Commission documents can be downloaded and the passing of EU legislation can be followed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-06-11a.34WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1572" speakername="Joan Ryan" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="34WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070611/wmstext/70611m0001.htm#0706112000061">
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/1">I am announcing that today &quot;The Integration Loans for Refugees and Others Regulations&quot; come into force. Integration loans, will be available to those granted refugee status or humanitarian protection and their respective dependants.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/2">When status is granted, these individuals enter into a period of transition during which most will need to find accommodation, train or re-qualify and seek employment. As part of the integration process an interest free loan with moderate repayment terms will make a considerable impact on their ability to become established in the UK. Applications can be made for loans up to a maximum &pound;1,000 and are designed to be spent on items that we believe will facilitate integration, particularly those related to housing, education and employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/3">The scheme will be jointly administered by the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions. Only those granted leave to enter or remain after today will be eligible to apply for an integration loan.</p>
	<p pid="a.34WS.2/4">With the introduction of integration loans we are now ending the ability of refugees to make a claim for a backdated payment of income related benefits. As well as being a more equitable replacement for the back payments system, we believe, integration loans will be an important tool in assisting new refugees and those granted humanitarian protection to establish themselves in the UK.</p>
