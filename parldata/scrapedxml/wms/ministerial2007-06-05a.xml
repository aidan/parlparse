	<p pid="a.8WS.6/1">The chairman of Monitor (the statutory name of which is the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts) announced last week that, in accordance with section 35 of the National Health Service Act 2006, Monitor had decided to authorise the following NHS acute trusts as NHS foundation trusts from <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.6/2" class="indent">Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Trust; and</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.6/3" class="indent">West Dorset General Hospitals NHS Trust</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.6/4">Monitor's announcement brings the total number of NHS foundation trusts to 67. A copy of Monitor's press notice has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.8WS.6/5">The Government remain committed to offering all NHS acute and mental health trusts the opportunity to apply for foundation status as soon as practicable. Monitor is now authorising trusts on a monthly basis, and further waves of NHS foundation trusts are set to follow.</p>

	<p pid="a.13WS.2/1">Lord Truscott will represent the UK at the forthcoming Energy Council in Luxembourg during the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-06">6 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/2">The only substantive item on the Council agenda is the Internal Gas ad Electricity Market, on which there will be a policy debate. The debate will follow on from the discussions of proposals put forward in the Commission' strategic energy review that took place at the Energy Council in February and spring European Council in March. One of the key conclusions agreed by Ministers and Heads of Government was that further measures were required to achieve a fully effective internal energy market. This is something that the UK very much supports.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/3">The debate will draw on three communications produced by the Commission and submitted to the Council as part of the Commission' strategic energy review (an energy policy for Europe) in January 2007. These discussion documents cover (a) Prospects for the Internal Gas and Electricity Market; (b) the Sector Inquiry by DG Competition on the Gas and Electricity Markets and (c) the EU' Priority Interconnection Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/4">Discussion will focus on the four main issues that the Commission intends to address in a further legislative package on the internal energy market, which is expected to be submitted in September 2007: further unbundling of networks, effective regulation, adequate infrastructure investment and co-operation among network operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/5">The UK Government support the Commission position on all these proposals, and considers them as vital for the further development of the internal market.</p>
	<p pid="a.13WS.2/6">The only other agenda item covers &quot;International relations in the field of energy&quot;. This is an important issue for the UK, though will only be an information item at this Council. It was discussed more fully at the March spring Council when the UK and other European Heads of Government reaffirmed the need for the EU to speak with a common voice on shared energy objectives. The German presidency and the Commission will report on a number of developments on the EU's relations with the USA, Russia, OPEC and Africa; on proposed international co-operation in energy efficiency; on the Energy Community Treaty; and on other EU initiatives in the international field.</p>

	<p pid="a.14WS.1/1">I will be representing the UK at the Telecoms Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="">7 June 2007</phrase>. This will be the only formal Telecoms Council under the German presidency of the European Union (EU).</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.1/2">The first item on the agenda will be political agreement on the proposal for a regulation on roaming on public mobile networks within the European Community. Following the endorsement by the European Parliament, it is expected that this Council meeting will also give political agreement to a text that will lead to the introduction of price reductions for consumers by the end of the summer. I intend to express my warm approval of the outcome, which as Members are aware, has been influenced by the UK. I will also take the opportunity to stress that the use of such a regulation to control prices should be seen as an exceptional measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.1/3">The presidency will then provide a progress report on the proposal for the full accomplishment of the internal market of community postal services by 2009. There are significant economic and consumer benefits to be achieved through liberalisation of the postal market, and for that reason I intend to intervene in support of the Commission to help move this proposal forward. Political discussions on this key proposal are likely to continue over a ministerial lunch, where I will reinforce the UK's position and seek to encourage others to move towards our objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.1/4">After lunch the Council will reconvene with the adoption of the Council conclusions for the i2010 annual Information Society Report for 2007. The i2010 strategy sets the context for the EU's work on information society and media issues. The strategy consists of three priorities: the regulatory environment; innovation and investment; and inclusion. In my intervention I will express my continued support for the Commission's i2010 strategy, stressing its importance as an economic driver in achieving the goals of the Lisbon strategy for Jobs and Growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.1/5">This agenda item will be followed by an exchange of views on the Commission's communication on the way forward for the take up of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in Europe. The UK welcomes the communication and generally supports its conclusions. During my intervention I will give my support to this communication but also emphasise the importance of avoiding excessive regulation as this will hinder the roll-out and take-up of RFID technology in the European and global economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.1/6">Finally, under any other business, the Commission will provide information on their forthcoming Communication on the Evaluation of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.1/7">I will write to Members again after the Telecoms Council to provide an update on discussions.</p>

	<p pid="a.14WS.4/1">In February 2006 we issued a draft of proposed revisions to the Highway Code for public consultation, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">15 May 2006</phrase>. Over 4,000 people offered a total of almost 27,000 comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.4/2">Taking account of these comments, a new draft version of the Highway Code was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March 2007</phrase>. A large number of responses to the consultation concerned the rules on cycling and more than 40 amendments were made to these and other rules to take account of comments from cyclists. However, since the code was laid before Parliament, further representations have been made by cyclists who remain concerned that the revised text of rules 61 and 63 on cycle facilities and cycle lanes is insufficiently clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.4/3">Following informal discussions with the CTC, an organisation representing cyclists, we are proposing changes to draft rules 61 and 63 to make clearer the position regarding the advice in the code on the use of cycle facilities and cycle lanes. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-31">31 May</phrase> the Department for Transport wrote to key road safety interests, including members of the Road Safety Advisory Panel, as well as cycling and walking representative bodies, concerning further changes to the Highway Code. A copy of the Department's letter has been placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.14WS.4/4">We have asked stakeholders to let us have their views by the end of <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 12 June</phrase>. The reason for this short timescale is so as not to unduly delay the publication of the new edition of the Highway Code. Any proposed changes have to be laid in Parliament for 40 days before they can come into effect, so will need to be laid by <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase> if the 40-day period is to be completed before summer recess. Views are requested by <phrase class="date" code="">12 June</phrase> to allow time for them to be considered before laying the changes in Parliament. We would then expect to publish the revised edition of the Highway Code in September.</p>

	<p pid="a.19WS.1/1">I have today published a consultation paper for the attention of stakeholders seeking views on proposed new guidelines to clarify and support the Government's &quot;water preferred&quot; policy of using water for the transport of abnormal indivisible loads.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.1/2">Since the 1970s Government have had a stated policy of using coastal shipping for moving the largest and heaviest abnormal loads. This was extended in 2002 to include the use of inland waterways wherever practical, economic and environmentally desirable. The &quot;water preferred&quot; policy encourages taking slow-moving abnormal loads off the road network, offering real benefits in terms of reducing disruption and congestion. The consultation is aimed at clarifying how the policy is applied and to provide greater transparency of the decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.1/3">Further information on the consultation is available from the Highways Agency website: <a href="http://www.highways.gov.uk">www.highways.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.1/4">Those wishing to comment on the proposals have until <phrase class="date" code="">28 August 2007</phrase> to do so. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.19WS.4/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-16">16 January</phrase> this year I announced that Paul Thornton had been appointed to undertake a review of the functions of pensions institutions as an independent external reviewer. I am pleased to advise the House that I am today laying a copy of his report in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.4/2">Paul Thornton has examined whether the functions of the Pensions Regulator, the Pension Protection Fund, the Pensions Ombudsman, the PPF Ombudsman and the Pensions Advisory Service, and the Financial Services Authority, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and the Financial Ombudsman Service in as much as their responsibilities covered pensions, are arranged most effectively. He has done so in an open and consultative way, seeking views from key stakeholders through an initial call for evidence, a consultation on emerging issues, meetings with key players and extensive engagement with the institutions themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.4/3">His report confirms that the existing institutions are delivering their functions effectively. He recommends that the Pensions Regulator should build on its effective joint working arrangements with the Pension Protection Fund and the Financial Services Authority. He also recommends that there would be benefits in bringing the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Ombudsman Service closer together, and identified a number of issues that would need to be resolved in doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.4/4">The Government welcome his report, and intend to proceed to implement his recommendations, working with the institutions and other interested parties to develop practical proposals that ensure that current and future pensioners may continue to rely on an effective institutional framework for pensions.</p>
