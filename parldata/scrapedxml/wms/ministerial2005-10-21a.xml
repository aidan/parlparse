	<p pid="a.71WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase> I laid before Parliament the annual reports and accounts for England's eight Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) outside London for 2004&ndash;05 and the RDAs' reported Tier 3 output results for 2004&ndash;05. Copies were placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.71WS.2/2">It has since been brought to my attention that the output figure for employment opportunities was reported inaccurately by Advantage West Midlands. Amended copies of the output results have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and are also available on the DTI website at: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/rda/info">www.dti.gov.uk/rda/info</a>. The correct figure is 11,760, which is above the Agency's target of 11,200. The incorrect figure given in July was 15,439.</p>
