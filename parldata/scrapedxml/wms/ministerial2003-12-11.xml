	Police Pension Scheme

	<p>I have today published a consultation paper which sets out proposals for a new police pension scheme for future entrants. We intend that the new scheme should be in place by no later than April 2006.</p>
	<p>The aim is to produce a modernised, more flexible scheme for a twenty first century police service. The proposed new scheme would include benefits such as a full pension of half final salary plus a lump sum of four times' pension after 35 years, life-long survivor benefits extended to unmarried and same sex partners as well as spouses, and a lower contribution rate of between 9 to 9.5 per cent. of pensionable pay. In line with Government policy on pension ages in future the new scheme would have a minimum pension age of 55 and a deferred pension age of 65 for those leaving the service before the age of 55.</p>
	<p>Currently serving officers who are in the existing scheme will remain there unless they opt to transfer to the new scheme. As members of the current scheme they will still be able to retire after 25 or more years' service with a pension age unaffected by the proposed changes. However, younger serving officers who leave the service early might be affected by Government proposals to apply the planned rise in the normal public service pension age from 60 to 65 to some existing staff. Any future move to raise the deferred pension age of currently serving officers to 65 would not be made before there had been a full debate about how this might be implemented across the public sector, and would apply only to pensionable service falling after the date of change.</p>
	<p>Government plans to raise the minimum pension age to 55 in April 2005 will not affect currently serving officers who continue in service until retirement under the present police pensions scheme. However, the consultation document discusses the arrangements that should be made for officers who enter the service between April 2005 and the start date of the new scheme, if such a time lag occurs.</p>
	<p>The consultation document also sets out Government plans for reforming the system of financing police pensions with a view to making expenditure on paying pensions to retired officers more predictable and more clearly separated from operational costs.</p>
	<p>We seek a well-informed and constructive debate on the proposed elements of a new scheme for future entrants to the police service before we come to our final decision on how to take police pensions forward into the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p>Copies of the consultation document are available in the House library and on the Home Office web-site <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/</a> Comments have been requested by 11 March 2004.</p>

	<p>A Home Office consultation document on the Review of support for community groups and community capacity building in England is being published online today. The consultation document outlines the results of the review on mapping existing Government activity in the field of community capacity building and makes proposals for change. The consultation document asks questions to inform how Government might take forward actions to implement change.</p>
	<p>The Government aim is to unify and make more effective the planning, resourcing and evaluating of provision for building the capacity of individuals and groups in communities to participate in community activity and contribute to a wide range of social objectives.</p>
	<p>The review focused on two main areas, and the proposals for change outlined in the consultation document relate to the:</p>
	<p class="indent">provision of support to community groups and community capacity building activities at community level, whether that be a neighbourhood, locality, parish or across a community of interest;</p>
	<p class="indent">policies and practices that govern the way that central, regional and local government supports community engagement, and thus civil renewal, through community capacity building initiatives and programmes.</p>
	<p>Copies of the consultation document are available in the House Library and on the Home Office <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs2/ccbrconsult.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs2/ccbrconsult.pdf</a> website. We would welcome views on the proposals and questions outlined in the consultation document.</p>
	<p>A partial regulatory impact assessment is included with the consultation document.</p>

	<p>I am pleased to announce that arrangements for the implementation of the futurebuilders fund for voluntary and community sector have now been completed. The fund will be transferred to the active communities unit in the Home Office from HM Treasury. Futurebuilders is a &pound;125 million investment over three years, mainly for one-off investment funding. We expect funding to come on stream towards the end of this financial year. The vast majority of the funds will be available in the next two financial years. The availability of funding will be publicised and organisations will be able to apply.</p>
	<p>The fund will be aimed at helping individual voluntary and community sector organisations strengthen the scale and scope of their contribution to the delivery of public services. This fund complements the &pound;80 million already being made available to support the implementation of a strategy for the development and support of voluntary and community organisations being jointly developed by government and the sector. Over &pound;200 million is therefore being invested between now and 2006 to building capacity within communities.</p>
	<p>This fits with our wider strategy to promote and develop volunteering and mentoring for all ages. We will shortly be investing funding in a number of volunteering initiatives including work with older volunteers.</p>
	<p>This will strengthen our communities and help ensure that they are better able to shape and deliver the services they need and to engage in volunteering and mentoring.</p>

	<p>In July this year, I announced that DTI and BNFL would conduct a joint review of the company's future strategy, and that recommendations would be made to the BNFL Board and Ministers in the Autumn.</p>
	<p>It was decided that a review was necessary to evaluate alternative strategies, following on from the decision to rule out a flotation of the company after the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority had been formed in April 2005. The review has been conducted against the framework of the Government's policy objectives set out in the White Paper &quot;Managing the Nuclear Legacy&mdash;a Strategy for Action&quot; and in particular the need to develop a competitive market for nuclear site management. It has been driven by the Government's overriding priority to ensure safe, efficient and effective clean-up at Sellafield and other civil nuclear sites. One of the key objectives of the review was to focus BNFL's activities more closely on the priority of UK clean-up.</p>
	<p>As announced in the White Paper, the NDA will take over strategic responsibility for the discharge of BNFL's UK nuclear liabilities from April 2005, subject to Parliamentary approval of the Energy Bill. A new parent company will be established at that point to hold those parts of BNFL that will not become the NDA's responsibility.</p>
	<p>The Government does not intend that the new parent company and its holdings will be privatised as a whole by flotation. We have also agreed that the sale of the entire group as an integrated structure is not an objective. However, proposals for involving the private sector in individual businesses will be examined on their merits, consistent with the Government's overall objectives of focusing on a more competitive market in UK clean-up, maximising the value and limiting the risk of BNFL's businesses to taxpayers; while ensuring that safety, security and environmental standards are maintained.</p>
	<p>Other key conclusions are :</p>
	<p class="indent">The principal focus of the new parent company will be clean-up activities at UK sites.</p>
	<p>In the period up to the establishment of the NDA in April 2005, BNFL and its Board will continue to have responsibility for the safe and efficient running of its existing sites and for the financial performance of the company and its subsidiaries.</p>
	<p>At the same time as a new parent company is established in April 2005, a new group of subsidiary companies will be established which will have initial responsibility for managing clean-up and operations at BNFL's UK sites under transitional arrangements to be agreed with the NDA. These companies will have the chance to bid to continue managing these sites when the NDA introduces competition.</p>
	<p>Fuel manufacture will continue at the Springfields site, where clean-up activity is also underway. It will be established as a separate licensed entity, likely to be managed initially by Westinghouse, and with the NDA taking financial responsibility for the relevant decommissioning and clean-up liabilities.</p>
	<p>The vast majority of the existing BNFL UK workforce will continue to be employed by companies that operate current BNFL sites. Initially, the two largest site licensee companies will be British Nuclear Fuels plc (which will continue to have the licence for the Sellafield site) and Magnox Electric plc. Other employees will transfer into companies within the clean-up group.</p>
	<p>BNFL's existing Research and Technology facilities and a proportion of the personnel will remain with the site licensee companies. Other staff will transfer to a new Nuclear Science and Technology Service (NSTS) which will initially be a subsidiary of the new parent company and will deliver services on a commercial basis to the NDA, site licensee companies and third parties. These proposed arrangements for R&amp;T are consistent with the Government's policy to keep the nuclear option open as set out in the White Paper &quot;Our Energy Future&mdash;creating a low carbon economy&quot;.</p>
	<p>The BNFL Board, and from April 2005, the Board of the new parent company will manage the other businesses to deliver value and in a way that limits and controls risk to the UK taxpayer.</p>
	<p>In relation to the Westinghouse business, the Government has agreed with the BNFL Board that steps will be taken to enable the business to operate with greater financial independence from its parent, so that possibilities for private sector participation are opened up.</p>
	<p>Future strategy for the investment in the Urenco fuel enrichment business will take full account of the strategic significance of this business and of the UK's nuclear non-proliferation obligations.</p>
	<p>BNFL is seeking routes to reduce significantly its exposure to the US clean-up market.</p>
	<p>These proposals are designed to help deliver the policy objectives set out in the 2002 White Paper &quot;Managing the Nuclear Legacy&quot; and are entirely consistent with our continuing commitment to keep the nuclear option open as set out in the 2003 Energy White Paper. They offer the best route towards both a more competitive market for UK clean-up, better value for taxpayers and a genuine opportunity for BNFL staff and management to continue to play a key role in meeting the challenge of nuclear clean-up.</p>
	<p>We are also very conscious of the need to consider the impact of the NDA proposals and BNFL's future strategy on local communities. This is why the legislation to establish the NDA will facilitate its involvement in social and economic activities to support them.</p>
	<p>We have sought to maximise the benefits from the establishment of the NDA to West Cumbria, for example:</p>
	<p class="indent">The headquarters of the NDA will be in West Cumbria.</p>
	<p class="indent">We have established a key project on UK nuclear skills in West Cumbria with the North West Development Agency</p>
	<p class="indent">Moreover, we are today setting out plans to establish a strategic taskforce for West Cumbria whose job it will be to plan and ensure the implementation of the social and economic regeneration of the area in light of decommissioning the Sellafield site.</p>
	<p>I am placing further details of the review outcome in the Library of the House.</p>

	EU Regional Policy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-12-11.93WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/960" speakername="Patricia Hewitt" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry" colnum="93WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo031211/wmstext/31211m02.htm#31211m02.html_spmin0">
	<p>On 17th September, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/.53WS"><i>Official Report</i> Column 53&ndash;54WS</phrase>, I confirmed that the Government's proposed EU Framework for Devolved Regional Policy would form the basis of our negotiating position in Europe. The Government believe that the EU Framework offers the best model to reform EU regional policy in line with the principles of a flexible UK regional policy, ensuring that it is both effective and fair for all Member States.</p>
	<p>We also believe that our proposal provides a sustainable response to the challenge of EU Enlargement and that it will actively support the Lisbon agenda of higher productivity and employment. The Government are committed to promoting regional policy over the longer term and this proposal reflects the Government's strong and enduring commitment to decentralisation and devolution and to ensuring that economic disparities between our nations and regions are identified and addressed.</p>
	<p>In the consultation exercise the Government conducted earlier this year, most of those who commented on the overall aim for reform of EU regional and cohesion policy supported our key objectives. But many of the respondents felt they did not have enough information to make a proper judgment and requested further details on how the proposed approach would operate in practice. This statement aims to provide that further information, while recognising that we cannot provide a definitive blueprint at this stage. Details will inevitably change as negotiations progress. The statement refers to a more detailed paper that I have deposited in the Library of the House today. Operation of the EU Framework</p>
	<p>We envisage that the EU Framework would be established by agreement in the European Council of a set of high level, outcome-focused objectives which support the achievement of the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas. Member States would then develop with their nations and regions, consistent with their respective constitutional arrangements or devolution arrangements, Devolved Strategies for Regional Policy which would be subject to a peer review process facilitated by the Commission. More details are given in section 1 of the accompanying paper.</p>
	<p>The Financial Guarantee</p>
	<p>The Government's guarantee that the nations and regions of the UK will not lose out if the EU Framework approach is agreed is based upon the amount of Structural Fund receipts that could be expected if, in 2007, the current allocation system were applied but in the context of an enlarged EU. This is explored further in section 2 of the accompanying paper.</p>
	<p>Possible delivery mechanisms</p>
	<p>The Government stressed in the consultation document that we want regional policy to respect devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and in future possibly in some English regions, and to be locally led with decisions taken as close as possible to local people, thereby supporting civil renewal. We also wanted to retain the strengths of the Structural Funds, such as multi annual funding and partnership working, but achieve significantly simplified delivery mechanisms. The ways in which such delivery in support of Framework objectives might work must take into account current devolved and decentralised arrangements and the views of stakeholders.</p>
	<p>In addition to seeking reassurance about their future role in decision-making on regional policy, many respondents also wanted to be reassured that the agendas supported by the Structural Funds would continue to be supported through domestic funding under the proposed approach. This applied particularly in the areas of skills and employment, social inclusion and regeneration and for rural and urban areas. Although it is not possible now to say exactly what the domestic institutional arrangements will be in 2007, nor exactly how increased domestic funding would be distributed or on what it would be focused, the direction of our thinking on these areas is set out in section 3 of the accompanying paper. This focuses on arrangements in England given that, as outlined in the consultation document, Devolved Administrations would continue to devise and implement their own regional policies.</p>
	<p>Links between EU regional policy reform and other EU policies</p>
	<p>The UK Government is a firm advocate of the need to transfer more funding from Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) production support and income subsidy to the CAP rural development budget. The aims of CAP rural development to effectively assist in conversion of the EU agriculture industry to a more sustainable structure and to tackle the social, economic and environmental consequences in rural areas of change in the sector, and our objectives for EU and domestic regional policy, need to be mutually supportive. Among other things, this means that the range of instruments available at EU, national or regional level needs to make a proper and well co-ordinated contribution to the Government's productivity agenda in rural areas as well as elsewhere. This is discussed further in section 4 of the accompanying paper.</p>
	<p>Since the Lisbon Council in March 2000, successive European Councils have called on Member States to</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;further their efforts to promote competition and reduce the general level of state aids.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Stockholm Council in March 2001 established the target that Member States should demonstrate a downward trend in state aid in relation to GDP by 2003. More recently, the Barcelona Council in March 2002 restated that aid should be directed to</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;horizontal objectives of common interest, including economic and social cohesion, and to target it to identified market failures. Less and better-targeted state aid is a key part of effective competition.&quot;</p>
	<p>The UK Government firmly supports these conclusions.</p>
	<p>In the context of regional policy, the Commission announced on 2 April 2003 that it would conduct a thorough review of its rules on regional state aid for the period after 1 January 2007. In line with the European Council conclusions on state aid, the UK will be seeking a modernised state aid system which is more efficient and which allows Member States to tackle the market failures which cause regional underperformance, while bearing down on distortive aids.</p>
	<p>Under an EU Framework, the objective of Structural Funds would be to aid development in the poorest Member States, while the state aid rules would allow all Member States to provide support to address regional and sub-regional/area underperformance, consistent with the need to ensure state aid discipline.</p>
	<p>EU Budget</p>
	<p>We believe that our proposal benefits all Member States by focusing scarce EU Budget resources where they will have the greatest effect. It also supports regional policy across the EU, by providing a shared policy framework for all Member States&mdash;whether recipients of funding or not&mdash;linked to the Lisbon goals and objectives. Our proposals, by providing a solution that is sustainable in the long-term (both for the Financial Perspective starting in 2007, and beyond), will bring lasting benefits shared by all Member States.</p>
	<p>The UK also believes that, like other elements of the budget, spending on regional policy should achieve a fair budgetary deal for the UK taxpayer. As a net contributor to the Structural and Cohesion Fund (SCF) budget, additional receipts from a larger SCF budget would only come at a net cost to the UK taxpayer, reducing the amount of potential funding available for UK regional policy. Further details on the budgetary aspects of reform are contained in section 5 of the accompanying paper.</p>
	<p>Conclusion</p>
	<p>The Government have already reformed domestic regional policy in England to enable all regions to reach their full potential, based on their indigenous strengths, and devolved substantial power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If the Government is to meet its ambitious domestic goals, and if EU cohesion policy is to be both sustainable, effective and fair for all Member States, radical reform is needed. In particular, we believe that EU regional policy should be substantially devolved and decentralised. The Commission has committed to examining in detail the options that have been put forward so far in its 3rd Cohesion report due next month and we await this analysis with interest. We, in turn, are committed to continuing to consult with domestic stakeholders and our EU partners as the debate develops with the aim of producing the best outcome for the new Member States, for Europe and for the nations and regions of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p>A new policy framework for Digital TV, which has been developed by the Office of the e-Envoy within the Cabinet Office, has been published today.</p>
	<p>This new set of policies will provide guidance and co-ordination to central and local government in developing digital TV as a viable channel for delivering e-Government services to the consumers. It is the result of extensive work and consultation with key stakeholders across government, industry, and the public.</p>
	<p>The DTV channel is an important tool in contributing to the Government objective of delivering all services electronically by 2005, with high levels of take-up. Currently, more than 11 million households in the UK have DTV, and the numbers are growing. DTV gives people the opportunity to access electronic government services in new ways, using the unique interactive and informational features of the medium.</p>
	<p>The framework document encourages all tiers of government, industry, broadcasters and other leading bodies to work together on a co-ordinated approach to ensure DTV succeeds in delivering its potential.</p>
	<p>Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p>Further to the Pre-Budget Statement made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I am today announcing the proposed allocation to English local authorities of an extra &pound;340 million of revenue support grant for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p>The Government are clear that it is right to provide this extra support to authorities to help them to improve public services. We are particularly conscious of the pressures for improvements in the areas of the environment and social services for children. The additional support will be provided as revenue support grant, which is not ring-fenced, and so can be used for any purpose.</p>
	<p>The increase in grant distributed by formula will now be 5.5 per cent. compared to 2003&ndash;04, on a like-for-like basis: overall grants to local authorities will increase by 7.1 per cent.</p>
	<p>The floors and ceilings on grant increases will change for authorities with education and social services responsibilities, to 4 per cent. and 7.5 per cent. respectively. In some cases, however, authorities will receive more than 7.5 per cent. because we are continuing to provide support for increased capital investment outside the floors and ceilings system.</p>
	<p>For shire districts, the additional grant is sufficient to raise the floor to 3 per cent. so all districts will get an above inflation increase. There will be no effective ceiling for districts, giving grant increases of up to 12.2 per cent. for individual authorities.</p>
	<p>There will be no changes in floors or ceilings for police and fire authorities.</p>
	<p>This will mean that for the second year running, every local authority will get at least an above inflation increase, with many getting substantially more.</p>
	<p>Tables showing grant totals and the revised provisional allocation of formula grant to all English local authorities for 2004&ndash;05 have been placed in the Vote Office and are also available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p>Given the scale of this change, the consultation period on our proposals will be extended and will now end on 9 January 2004. The House will then have the chance to debate the Government's final proposals in late January or early February. As is normal, the detailed allocations to individual authorities may still change as data on council tax base and capital allocations are updated.</p>
	<p>Given the scale of the investment in local services and the scope for efficiency improvements in local government, the Government believe next year local authorities must aim to deliver council tax increases in low single figures. Unreasonably large council tax increases will be neither justified nor acceptable.</p>
	<p>So the Government are prepared to use targeted capping powers next year if that proves necessary.</p>
	<p>When considering whether to cap authorities, the Government will look at a range of factors including the level and increase in the council tax and the level of the budget. In areas where there is a combined fire authority, budgets for 2004&ndash;05 will not be comparable with 2003&ndash;04 because the combined fire authority is precepting for the first time in 2004&ndash;05. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is today issuing a consultation document which sets out the proposed methodology and the notional budget figures as a result of this change. A copy of this will be made available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	Draft Fire and Rescue Framework 2004&ndash;05
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-12-11.97WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government, Regional Governance and Fire" colnum="97WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo031211/wmstext/31211m03.htm#31211m03.html_spmin1">
	<p>In June the Government published the White Paper, &quot;Our Fire and Rescue Service&quot;. It set out a package of reforms designed to improve the service and to save more lives. Today the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is publishing a draft fire and rescue national framework that will outline how to implement the White Paper's proposals. It sets out the Government's objectives for the Fire and Rescue Service and what Fire and Rescue Authorities should do to achieve these outcomes. It also sets out what the Government will do to improve the service and what support it will provide to Fire and Rescue Authorities. In due course, the expectations in the Framework will also help to shape the Audit Commission's fire and rescue Comprehensive Performance Assessment.</p>
	<p>The Framework is based on a partnership approach. The Government is committed to giving Fire and Rescue Authorities adequate support and flexibility to help them meet the specific needs of their local communities. For this reason we are initially issuing it in draft form and welcome comments and suggestions by 12 March 2004 both on the proposals in the draft Framework and on how to make the future versions as helpful and relevant as possible. We aim to publish the first National Framework in Spring 2004.</p>
	<p>The legislation announced in the Queen's speech will place the Framework on a statutory footing. It will require the Government to report to Parliament on the extent to which Fire and Rescue Authorities are acting in accordance with the National Framework and any steps the Government has taken to ensure that they do.</p>
	<p>We are also today publishing Mott MacDonald's most recent study into fire and rescue control rooms, and HM Fire Service Inspectorate's review of the subject. The study reinforced the report's conclusions that regional control rooms would significantly enhance national resilience. The Government is persuaded by the conclusions of the study and proposes to establish regional control rooms in England, including the one already established in London, working closely with Fire and Rescue Authorities through their Regional Management Boards. We have written to the Practitioners Forum asking for their views on our proposed approach.</p>
	<p>The Fire and Rescue Service is, rightly, widely admired for its professionalism and the dedication of its staff. The White Paper made clear, however, that it was also in need of urgent reform. Publication of the draft National Framework sets out the Government's expectations of the Service, what Fire and Rescue Authorities should do and the support the Government will provide. It demonstrates the Government's continued commitment, in partnership with Fire and Rescue Authorities, to driving down the number of fire deaths and injuries, improving fire and rescue services and saving more lives.</p>
	<p>Copies of the Draft Fire and Rescue National Framework 2004/05, the full Mott MacDonald report, the summary of the Mott MacDonald report, and the HM Fire Service Inspectorate review are available in the libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p>The BBC's Royal Charter&mdash;the seventh in the history of the corporation&mdash;is due to expire on 31 December 2006. I have today launched the first phase of a process of review that will result in a strong BBC, independent of Government, from the end of the current Charter and beyond. That period will be marked by continuing rapid advances in technology, and changes in society, culture and practice&mdash;the way people receive and make use of broadcast content. Charter review will be characterised by our openness, our efforts to engage as broad a section of the population as we can, and our commitment to listen to what people have to say. And I am being helped in this by Lord Burns, who will provide me with independent advice throughout.</p>
	<p>Charter review is not a single process. It will take in a range of existing and planned work, including Ofcom's review of public service television, the independent review of BBC online and the forthcoming reviews of the BBC's new digital services.</p>
	<p>But it will also feature widespread public involvement, built around a three-phase process of consultation. Phase one starts today, based on a very broad consultation document&mdash;The Review of the BBC's Royal Charter&mdash;which I have published today. I have placed copies of the document&mdash;and a supporting leaflet&mdash;in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p>Phase two, timed to begin around the end of 2004, will aim to bring together the results of phase one, the conclusions of various reviews taking place over the course of next year and the findings of our own programme of research into a green paper, which will be published for a further stage of consultation.</p>
	<p>A White Paper will follow, with a further round of consultation. We will conclude the process with a full and formal opportunity for both Houses to contribute their views.</p>
	<p>Today's publication forms the central plank of phase one. It sets out a framework for consultation&mdash;based on a series of key themes&mdash;within which there is plenty of room for discussion of all aspects of the BBC's role, structure and function. The consultation will be supported by a programme of survey research and direct engagement with the public and stakeholders.</p>
	<p>The BBC belongs to everyone. It is one of our most valued institutions. In many ways, it reflects what is best about the values, culture and society of the United Kingdom, at home and abroad. Charter review gives the whole country an opportunity to have its say about the kind of BBC it wants for the future.</p>

	<p>The Government is today laying regulations <sup>1</sup> before Parliament which transpose the Water Framework Directive in England and Wales. Defra is also publishing on the Defra web-site a final Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) <sup>2</sup> as well as a summary of the views of those who commented on the most recent consultation on the Directive, and a Government response to their comments <sup>3</sup> .</p>
	<p>The regulations provide the framework for delivery of the Directive's demanding environmental objectives. The quality of rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwaters must be protected and enhanced by 2015. In addition, wetlands depending on groundwater must be safeguarded and water related requirements of other Community legislation taken into account.</p>
	<p>All this action must be integrated into packages of measures and plans based on river basins, which must be drawn up with full public participation.</p>
	<p>The regulations comprise one set covering England and Wales (which have already been approved by the National Assembly for Wales) and a further set covering the Northumbria river basin district which crosses slightly over the England/Scotland border.</p>

	<p>Transposition is only the first step</p>
	<p>The Water Framework Directive is of exceptional importance in setting the objectives for our policies towards the water environment for years to come. The Government is fully committed to these objectives. Transposition of the Directive through these regulations is a significant stage in its implementation. But it is important to recognise that it is only one step along the road. Full implementation will depend on a wide range of further decisions and actions to be taken over the coming years. The transposition regulations should be seen as enabling and requiring these further steps to take place. But they are by no means all that is needed to put the directive into practice. Key issues, as currently envisaged, on which further decisions and action will be needed, in order to achieve this, are summarised in the annex.</p>
	<p>The overall effect of the regulations is that in England, the Secretary of State has ultimate responsibility for the Directive's implementation; this responsibility includes:</p>
	<p>an explicit role in approving environmental objectives, programmes of measures and river basin management plans;</p>
	<p>the power to issue guidance to the Agency and other relevant bodies, to which they are bound to have regard.</p>
	<p>The Environment Agency has responsibility to:</p>
	<p>Characterise river basin districts;</p>
	<p>Identify bodies of water used for the abstraction of drinking water;</p>
	<p>Prepare, review and keep up to date a register of protected areas for each river basin district;</p>
	<p>Establish programmes to monitor water status, so as to establish an overview of water status within each river basin district;</p>
	<p>Prepare and submit to the 'appropriate authority' (i.e. Secretary of State and/or National Assembly for Wales) environmental objectives for each body of water and programmes of measures;</p>
	<p>Prepare and submit to the appropriate authority a river basin management plan for each district (including consultation, publicity and taking account of views) and supplementary plans.</p>
	<p>The Government has greatly appreciated the input made through the comments of those who have responded to consultation. The Government is setting out its response to them today on the Defra website. A very wide range of comments were received and a wide range of changes have been made to the draft regulations published in August this year. These include revisions to provisions dealing with programmes of measures, river basin management plans, public participation and publication of information.</p>
	<p>A framework for action</p>
	<p>The regulations set the framework for further implementation action by both the Government and the Environment Agency, as competent authority for the Directive. There is much more action to come. The regulations achieve transposition; but the Government will be building on the regulations by bringing forward a range of proposals dealing with such issues as controls on diffuse pollution, River Basin Management Plan guidance and the development of a Water Framework Directive communications strategy.</p>
	<p>Discussions continue in Brussels on linked proposals for new Directives on groundwater and priority substances, building on Water Framework Directive requirements. Further work is underway at Community level to develop guidance packages to support implementation of the Directive. The UK will continue actively to support such work, including through its pilot river basin scheme based on the river Ribble in the North-West. The regulations need to be seen therefore in the context of this further future action.</p>
	<p>Key early actions</p>
	<p>The EA, as competent authority in England and Wales, will consult in 2004 on a public participation strategy. This will in turn inform the formal mechanisms that will ensure full and proper participation of wider society at the river basin level. It is not just the Government that must ensure that all are aware of and fully engaged in this process&mdash;there is also an important role for all agencies and organisations that wish to see a better quality water environment. To this end Defra and the EA are already developing, in close consultation with stakeholders, a WFD communication strategy for England to raise awareness of both the WFD and water quality issues.</p>
	<p>The benefits and opportunities the Directive will provide&mdash;economic and social regeneration, biodiversity, integration of land-use and sectoral planning, flood management, fisheries/marine, health and amenity&mdash;must be explained and seized upon. For its own part the Government has instituted much of this integration within its own structures already, building on the principles outlined in its 2002 statement of priorities for water policy, &quot;Directing the Flow&quot;. This will continue, as will the focus on delivery at the regional and sub-regional level.</p>
	<p>Meeting the good ecological and chemical status requirements in the directive will be a challenge. A key analysis of impacts of human activity on water bodies must be completed by December 2004. Diffuse pollution from agricultural and urban sources will need to be tackled as a priority to meet the Directive's objectives, as well as further reductions in point source discharges. The costs of the measures required to meet &quot;good status&quot; will need to be apportioned to water users and other sectors in a transparent and rational way. A robust economic analysis is a core requirement of this Directive and will ensure that the benefits of the measures employed justify the costs involved. (Defra will assess the scope for updating the final RIA from 2005). Costs must, as far as possible, adhere to the polluter pays principle. Defra is leading this analysis in England, in conjunction with Ofwat and the Environment Agency. The results will underpin the identification of the most effective suite of measures be they regulatory, fiscal, incentive or voluntary. Each of these measures will be formulated with the full engagement of the wider public both within the auspices of the WFD stakeholder forum for England and at the regional and local level through the active</p>
	<p>Helping to carry forward the directive with the wider water agenda</p>
	<p>Alongside action to carry forward implementation of the requirements of the Directive through these regulations, the Government will actively be pursuing linked actions, consistent with the overall policy objectives of &quot;Directing the Flow&quot; and the aims and spirit of the Directive.</p>
	<p>These will include: work to carry forward and implement the provisions of the Water Act 2003 that will</p>
	<p class="indent">further the sustainable use of water resources;</p>
	<p class="indent">promote water conservation; including a requirement for mandatory water company drought plans which up until now have been voluntary.</p>
	<p class="indent">completion of the current Periodic Review of water prices and related environmental investment programmes to protect and enhance surface and groundwater water quality, including the water needs of important wetlands and other important biodiversity sites;</p>
	<p class="indent">work within the context of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) on hazardous substances and nutrients and work to help deliver the Government's vision for the marine environment as set out in &quot;Seas of Change&quot;;</p>
	<p class="indent">work on establishing effective integration and linkages between river basin management plans (including supplementary plans) and other plans with a bearing on them, including abstraction plans, flood management plans and land use plans.</p>

	<p>The fees for care services currently regulated by the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) will be increased in April 2004. A table of the new fees is as follows.</p>
	<p>Regulatory fee income is to assist with the funding of the NCSC, with the intention of achieving full cost recovery after five years, with a review in 2004. The policy on regulatory fees&mdash;including the intention of full cost recovery and the consequences for later years&mdash;was established following consultation in 2001. The fee structure also makes the costs of regulation transparent and borne by those who stand to benefit from more consistent national minimum standards so that pressures will apply to the regulatory process to ensure that it continues to be effective and efficient.</p>
	<p>Next April, the Commission for Social Care Inspection will take on the NCSC's role of regulating independent social care providers. The regulation of private and voluntary healthcare providers will move from the NCSC to the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection. The new Commissions will further strengthen the system for inspecting those services.</p>
	<p>Individual letters are being sent to all providers of care services regulated by the NCSC to notify them about the increases.</p>

	Aspire IT Services Contract
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2003-12-11.105WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1171" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" speakeroffice="The Paymaster General" colnum="105WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo031211/wmstext/31211m05.htm#31211m05.html_spmin1">
	<p>The Inland Revenue is today announcing that Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young (CGEY) has been selected as the Department's preferred supplier for the Aspire IT services contract.</p>
	<p>Aspire will provide a range of Information Technology/Information Systems and related services including voice. These services are intended to support current and new business channels (including e-business) as the Department faces the challenges of the future. Because no one single supplier can provide the full range of IT services the Inland Revenue requires, CGEY will act as the Prime supplier with responsibility for integrating Inland Revenue systems and supporting transformation, supported by co-partners.</p>
	<p>The initial term of the contract will be 10 years, with options to extend, potentially in a number of stages, for up to 18 years.</p>
	<p>The competition sought to identify the bidder which delivers the most economically advantageous tender. Two preferred bidders were announced on 16 July 2003. Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young and Revenue Professional Services (RPS&mdash;an alliance of EDS and Accenture). The Project developed a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation process that commenced with the receipt of responses to the Invitation to Tender (ITT) in March 2003. The technical fit of each proposition was tested against specific criteria for:</p>
	<p class="indent">strategic partnership potential</p>
	<p class="indent">ability to deliver IT services</p>
	<p class="indent">ability to innovate and deliver technology enabled change</p>
	<p class="indent">ability to manage transition to the new contract effectively.</p>
	<p>In parallel with this activity there was a financial and commercial evaluation.</p>
	<p>CGEY proved themselves across the range of evaluation criteria and demonstrated their capacity to act as strategic partner. In addition, the contract prices quoted by both bidders were compared with each other and with a baseline established through the use of professional benchmarking advisers (a &quot;Should Cost Model&quot;).</p>
