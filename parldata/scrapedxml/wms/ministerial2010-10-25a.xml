	&quot;A Long-Term Focus for Corporate Britain&quot;
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-10-25a.1WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" speakername="Vincent Cable" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills" colnum="1WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101025/wmstext/101025m0001.htm#1010256000064">
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/1">I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-22">22 September</phrase> that I would be undertaking a review into corporate governance and short-termism. Today's publication of &quot;A Long-Term Focus for Corporate Britain-a call for evidence&quot; marks the first stage of this review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/2">The UK has benefited greatly from open, free and well functioning capital markets. Our companies and markets have been successful in attracting investment into the UK and providing wealth creation which we need to prosper as a nation. But recent events have exposed weaknesses. We must ensure that growth is not compromised by short-term volatility or its benefits captured by a few at the expense of the many who provide the capital, and the wider national interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/3">Government intervention, both through regulation and other measures, seeks to address such failures, while maintaining markets which are as free and open as possible. The UK has led the world in developing high standards of corporate governance, most recently with the introduction of the stewardship code, setting out the role of shareholders in holding directors to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/4">These are important steps to secure sustainable UK growth for the future. The review aims to establish whether there are further issues affecting the functioning of capital markets and, if so, what are the causes. It considers the role of directors and shareholders and asks fundamental questions; for example, about shareholder engagement, market short-termism and the functioning of the investment chain in the UK. It also considers directors' remuneration and-following up the takeover panel's recent announcement-the economic case for takeovers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/5">This review builds on the report published by the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee on &quot;Mergers, Acquisitions and Takeovers: The Takeover of Cadbury by Kraft&quot;. It is also closely linked to the Department's recent consultation on the future of narrative reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.2/6">I am placing copies of this document in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.1WS.5/1">The Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-19">19 October 2010</phrase>. The following items were discussed:</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/2" class="italic">Administrative Co-operation in the Field <i>o</i>f Taxation</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/3">This directive aims to improve arrangements for exchange of information on request and bring the EU into line with OECD standards. It also extends automatic exchange of information, which the UK supports to the extent that this does not impose disproportionate burdens on business or on tax authorities at a time of fiscal consolidation. The Council agreed that they would aim to reach political agreement on this issue at their November meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/4" class="italic">VAT Reverse Charge Derogation</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/5">The Council agreed that a new derogation should be provided, until the end of 2013, to Germany, Italy and Austria, allowing the application of a reverse charge to mobile telephones and computer chips. The Council also agreed to extend, until the same date, the UK's VAT reverse charge to domestic trade in mobile phones and computer chips. The reverse charge has been a key component in reducing VAT fraud and has helped protect billions of pounds since 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/6" class="italic">Stability and Growth Pact</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/7">The Council discussed Lithuania and Romania's excessive deficit programmes. They agreed that the actions taken by both countries represented adequate progress towards the correction of excessive deficits within the deadlines set by the Council, and that no further steps under the excessive deficit procedure were required at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/8" class="italic">Debrief on the Informal ECOFIN <i>M</i>eeting</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/9">The Council briefly took stock of discussions held during the informal ECOFIN in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-01">1 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/10" class="italic">Preparation of the G20 Ministerial Meeting</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/11">The Council endorsed the terms of reference for the G20 ministerial meeting in South Korea on 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-23">23 October</phrase>. These will form the basis of the EU's contribution to the meeting. The Government believe that these reflect UK priorities. However, since the UK's views are represented through the separate UK seat in the G20, the UK is not bound by these terms of reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/12" class="italic">Tertiary Education</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/13">The Council adopted conclusions on a Commission report on tertiary education. The UK is content with the report, which was commissioned by the May ECOFIN Council to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending on tertiary education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/14" class="italic">Report on Fiscal Frameworks</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/15">Ministers adopted Council conclusions which welcome a report on fiscal frameworks. The Government support the report, which highlights common features of successful national experiences in the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/16" class="italic">Preparation for European Council: Levies and Taxes <i>o</i>n Financial Institutions</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/17">ECOFIN agreed a report to the European Council on levies and taxes on financial institutions. The Government are content with the report, which recognises that there is no consensus on how national Governments should deploy the proceeds from bank levies. It states that an EU-only financial transaction tax could result in significant distortion of competition and relocation of financial activity within the global financial system, so careful analysis needs to be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/18" class="italic">Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive</p>
	<p pid="a.1WS.5/19">The Council reached unanimous political agreement on the presidency's compromise text on the alternative investment fund managers directive. This will now form the basis of further discussions with the European Parliament, which is due to vote in plenary session in November. This agreement represents a number of significant gains for the UK from the ECOFIN general approach of <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-05">5 May</phrase>, including provision to extend the marketing passport to managers and funds outside of the EU. The Government also successfully ensured that the agreement limits the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority to those already provided for in the package on financial supervision.</p>

	London Regional Committee Report (Government Response)

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-10-25a.3WS.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40322" speakername="Francis Maude" speakeroffice="The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General" colnum="3WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101025/wmstext/101025m0001.htm#1010256000068">
	<p pid="a.3WS.6/1">The report by the House of Commons London Regional Committee on their only inquiry into London's population and the 2011 census was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> (HC 349). This Government did not re-establish the Regional Committees. They recognise the importance of providing a response to Parliament on the issues raised by the Committee. The majority of the recommendations in the report were for the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Two of the Committee's recommendations were for Government and this written ministerial statement provides the Government's response. The other recommendations were for ONS and I have placed today a copy of its response in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.6/2">This Government have serious concerns about the 2011 census introduced by the previous Parliament. Having given the issue serious consideration, and the costs already incurred, the 2011 census is the only way that unique information can be provided to meet essential UK and EU requirements in the given timeframe at no extra cost than that budgeted. It is important that the 2011 census goes ahead and this Government will continue to promote the importance of the public engaging with the 2011 census.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.6/3">Given the highly mobile nature of the population, the UK Statistics Authority recognises the increasing difficulties and costs in carrying out a census. The authority has therefore instructed ONS to urgently work on developing alternatives, with the intention that the 2011 census is the last of its kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.6/4">Recommendation 21 of the Committee's report was dealt with by the previous Government, with my predecessor writing to the Chair of the Committee shortly before the report was published.</p>
	<p pid="a.3WS.6/5">Recommendation 14 of the report was on the need for the census address register being developed by the ONS for the 2011 census to be maintained after the census. The previous Government failed to deliver a definitive address register, despite the demands for such a register and the associated costs of inefficiency in maintaining a number of similar registers. This Government are working with the parties concerned and will look to deliver a definitive register. Considerable progress has already been achieved. The work ONS has done will form part of the solution.</p>
