	<p>I am pleased to be able to announce that we will be buying 64 Tomahawk land attack missiles from the United States under the terms of a foreign military sales case. These are conventionally armed land attack missiles. These new missiles will be to higher&mdash;Block IV&mdash;specification than our existing Block III missiles. As such, they will provide the ability to retarget or abort a mission in flight and will also provide battle damage indication. They will be capable of being fired from our current Trafalgar Class submarines as well as from our new Astute Class submarines when they enter service.</p>
	<p>This decision shows our continued commitment to enabling precision attack at long range against selected targets.</p>

	<p>I am pleased to announce that the Northern Ireland discretionary social fund budget for 2004&ndash;05 will be &pound;58.25 million; &pound;12.64 million will be allocated to grants, &pound;45.51 million to loans and &pound;0.1 million will be held as a contingency reserve. The new allocations represent an increase of &pound;1.65 million over the initial gross budget set at April 2004. This increase will be funded through higher loan recoveries, plus an increase in net treasury funding of &pound;0.94 million for this year. This &pound;0.94 million is the second of three annual increases from a &pound;8.2 million boost for the discretionary social fund announced in the autumn 2002 pre-Budget report.</p>
	<p>The community care grant budget has been increased by &pound;0.94 million to &pound;12.64 million. This will provide more help to customers, in particular families with children and the disabled.</p>
	<p>The loans budget has been increased to &pound;45.51 million, an increase of &pound;0.71 million on the initial 2003&ndash;04 loans budget. To improve the fairness of the scheme, budgets will be allocated in a way that will over time achieve greater consistency of outcome for customers wherever they live.</p>
	<p>Details of the budget allocations, together with a note explaining the basis on which they have been made, have been placed in the House of Commons Library today.</p>

	<p>The new arrangements for child support came into operation for new cases and some linked old scheme cases from 3 March 2003. Progress has been slower than anticipated, chiefly due to problems with the new computer and telephony systems. However, over the course of the first year of operation of the new scheme, progress in performance has grown steadily. For example, more than a third of all maintenance calculations and over 45 per cent. of all first payments were made in the latest quarter. Further improvement is expected.</p>
	<p>The number of cases cleared in the final quarter rose above 50,000 taking the total number of clearances (calculations and closures) to over 150,000. The ratio of cases reaching calculation compared to those that closed continued to be 6:4 to the year's end, comparing favourably with the ratio of 4:6 under the old scheme.</p>
	<p>Technical issues continue to preclude reliable figures on compliance and throughput for the latest quarter. The Department continues to retain around 15&ndash;20 per cent. of each monthly payment due to EDS, the service provider, due to the continuing problems with the computer and telephony systems. A special exercise is being undertaken to test accuracy to the year-end.</p>
	<p>Average weekly child support maintenance payments to parents with care are shown below. Figures are for March 2004 only and are calculated as the total amount received and allocated divided by the number of cases.</p>

	<p>Notes:</p>
	<p><sup>(1)</sup>   Quarter 4 totals and Scheme to March 2004 figures include clerical cases (new scheme cases unable to be progressed on the new system) which are not included in the month-by-month figures. Figures for these are as follows:      Applications cleared                        824      Maintenance Calculations         715      Closures                                                      109</p>
	<p><sup>(2)</sup>   Closures: Applications close for a variety of reasons. The main reasons are that the parent with care withdraws the application, perhaps due to reconciliation, or having agreed private arrangements with the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p><sup>(3)</sup>   Figures marked with * are not available on a monthly basis for this period.</p>
	<p>A proportion of cases that have a maintenance calculation in place may already be receiving payment directly, but will not be reflected in the figures shown above.</p>
	<p>Figures for child maintenance premium payments include an estimate of the number of parents who receive the premium by way of a disregard to their income support/income-based jobseekers allowance. The disregard has been added from August as data were not available prior to this, and has also been included in the scheme to date figure.</p>

	<p>I can now provide latest monthly progress report on the take-up of pension credit, which became payable on 6 October 2003.</p>
	<p>There are now 2.40 million pensioner households (2.91 million individuals) being paid pension credit, including 138,000 pension credit households (176,000 individuals) added in March. This is the greatest monthly increase in the number of pension credit households (so far to date) and means that we have met our published target for the end of March. As at 31   March, there are 1.74 million households (2.09 million individuals) now receiving more money as a result of the introduction of pension credit. The pension credit application line, at our four sites across the country, has received millions of calls since it became operational on 7 April 2003 and 95 per cent. of calls have been answered within 30 seconds. The average pension credit award is &pound;41.34 per week.</p>
	<p>Our direct mail campaign is continuing, supported by a major advertising campaign on TV and in the press. By the end of this month we will have written to every pensioner household in the country to tell them about pension credit. We are continuing to work with organisations such as Help The Aged, Age Concern and Citizens Advice, among others, both at national and local level, to encourage eligible people to take up their entitlement. In particular, the pension service is focusing on those customers who are less likely to take up their entitlement.</p>
	<p>There is plenty of time for pensioners to apply for pension credit. To ensure that pensioners do not lose out there is a twelve-month backdating provision, as announced in the Budget statement. This will allow applications to be backdated for a year, or to the date entitlement begins if this is later.</p>
	<p>I am placing in the Library a report showing progress so far, including regional breakdowns of the number of pension credit households and numbers of pension credit cards in parliamentary constituencies in Great Britain. Copies of the report are also available for hon. Members in the Vote Office.</p>
