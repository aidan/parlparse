	<p>On 1 August 1999, new operational guidelines on the use of baton rounds were issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and replaced previous Home Office guidance. ACPO have now put forward revised guidelines to take account of developments in the weapon system, training and procedures for deployment which are designed to reduce the potential for serious injury and life threatening injuries.</p>
	<p>The guidelines now include specific reference to the implications of the European Convention on Human Rights and also highlights that every effort should be made to ensure children are not placed at risk.</p>
	<p>The revised guidance also takes account of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council statement on the use of the L21Al baton round at ranges from 1 to 19 metres, announced by the then Minister of State at the Home Office, my right hon.

	<p>The Government are firmly committed to maintaining effective immigration controls while at the same time ensuring that genuine passengers are able to pass through our ports with the least possible inconvenience.</p>
	<p>Visa regimes play an important part in the operation of our immigration controls. They allow for checks to be undertaken before a person embarks for the UK to confirm whether they qualify for admission. But we recognise that visa regimes do represent an inconvenience for some passengers and we will therefore only maintain them where the immigration threat is such as to justify doing so. At present Slovak nationals require a visa in order to visit the UK. However, we judge that there is no longer any significant threat to our immigration controls from Slovak nationals and therefore we have decided that the visa regime should be lifted and standard on-entry immigration controls will continue to be applied. Changes to the immigration rules will be made on 17 December and the visa regime will be lifted from 00.01 hours on 18 December.</p>

	<p>On 15 July 2003 the Government published in full the independent report of Mr. Justice Butterfield on the current practices and procedures relating to disclosure, associated investigation techniques and case management in HM Customs and Excise's criminal cases. The Attorney-General and I had asked Mr. Justice Butterfield to examine the circumstances that led to the termination of the London City Bond prosecutions in Liverpool Crown Court on 25 November 2002, the changes in practice within Customs since the time of the cases to which those prosecutions related, and Customs' compliance with best practice in the use of investigation techniques. Mr. Justice Butterfield also examined the preparation for and presentation of cases for Court on behalf of Customs.</p>
	<p>On publication of the report, as I said in my written statement on 15 July, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-07-15.18WS"><i>Official Report</i> Column 18&ndash;20WS</phrase>, the Government accepted in full a number of Mr. Justice Butterfield's recommendations, many of which have now been implemented. On the recommendation that&mdash;in order to make its independence from Customs even more transparent&mdash;the Customs and Excise Prosecution Office (CEPO) should become an entirely separate prosecuting authority accountable to the Attorney-General, the Government undertook to provide a response in the autumn.</p>
	<p>In his report, Mr. Justice Butterfield acknowledged the revitalisation of CEPO following the injection of additional resources and the improvement in the engagement with investigators. He referred to a palpable and detectable improvement in morale in CEPO. He went on to recommend that the Solicitor for Customs and Excise should relinquish responsibility for prosecutions resulting from Customs investigations.</p>
	<p>The Government agree that, to be most effective, these prosecutors must be independent, and be seen to be independent by judges, barristers and solicitors in the wider criminal justice system. The Government consider it essential that there should be full confidence in prosecutors acting on behalf of Customs and accept the case for radical change.</p>
	<p>The Government accordingly accept the recommendation of Mr. Justice Butterfield to separate the prosecution and investigation functions in Customs, and to create an independent Customs and Excise Prosecutions Office during the course of 2004, led by a Director accountable directly to the Attorney-General. The Office will be subject to a regular, independent and thorough inspection regime.</p>
	<p>The Government intend to move to appoint a Director as soon as practicable, who will be closely involved in the creation of an independent CEPO.</p>
	<p>The Government also accept the recommendation that Investigation Legal Advisers should now move to become the responsibility of HM Commissioners of Customs and Excise, and that these advisers will not be involved in the prosecution process. This arrangement will be reviewed after two years.</p>
	<p>The creation of an independent CEPO will require the resolution of a number of practical issues, to which the Attorney-General and I are giving careful consideration.</p>

	<p>This consultation covers the Government's proposals for revisions to the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations. Views are being invited from stakeholders on these proposed changes.</p>
	<p>It is intended that the new regulations will be laid in spring 2004 and come into force in October 2004.</p>
	<p>The aim of the revisions is to streamline procedures in order to promote the early settlement of cases through ACAS conciliation and, where that fails, to expedite the passage of cases through the Tribunal system.</p>
	<p>The changes arise from provisions of the Employment Act 2002, from recommendations of the Employment Tribunal System Taskforce, and from suggestions offered by the Employment Tribunal Presidents&mdash;for England and Wales and for Scotland&mdash;to help make the system run more smoothly. The revisions are designed to deliver a better service and swifter justice for all, and include, amongst other things, the adoption of a new pre-acceptance procedure for both claimants and respondents, and a re-structuring and re-writing of the Rules in plain English.</p>
	<p>These proposed tribunal regulations form part of an overall package of measures. They take account of, and dovetail with, the new dispute resolution regulations being introduced by the Government to encourage settlement of disputes in the workplace. The Government also intends to revise the Employment Appeal Tribunal rules to a similar timescale.</p>
	<p>In preparing the revised Regulations, DTI has been working closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including the judicial Presidents, the Employment Tribunals Service and ACAS. Representatives of businesses and the trade unions have also been involved in the preliminary consultation process. These and other bodies will now, through this formal public consultation, have a further opportunity to offer views on the way the revised regulations are to be taken forward and to ensure that the procedures of the Employment Tribunals deliver fairness and justice to all.</p>

	<p>I have today published a White Paper &quot;Fair, Clear and Competitive: A Consumer Credit Market for the 21st Century&quot;, setting out the Government's proposals for reform of the legislation governing consumer credit. The White Paper sets out the conclusions of the review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 launched in July 2001 and is based on extensive consultation with stakeholders.</p>
	<p>As part of the White Paper package, I have also today published for consultation detailed proposals&mdash;including draft legislation&mdash;for changes to the rules governing the early settlement of credit agreements; the advertising of consumer credit; and the form and content of credit agreements. The consultation also sets out new proposals on the calculation of credit card APRs and on facilitating the conclusion of credit agreements by electronic means.</p>
	<p>Britain has the most energetic and competitive consumer credit market in Europe. However, the legislation regulating it is almost thirty years old. Although it has generally stood the test of time extremely well, the credit market has developed to an extent never envisaged in the early 1970s.</p>
	<p>The time is right for a thorough-going modernisation of the consumer credit framework; one that encourages and enables innovation and competition in the marketplace, yet still provides appropriate protection for today's consumers.</p>
	<p>Credit has become an integral part of our daily lives. For many, it is the lifeline that enables them to deal with the emergencies that arise, helping match regular income against the irregular demands and risks of modern life.</p>
	<p>But credit, of course, can also introduce risks of its own. Some consumers take out loans that are inappropriate and expensive. Others are tipped into debt by a sudden change in circumstance. But there are also consumers that are preyed upon by loan-sharks, whose activities often exploit the socially deprived sections of our community. It is simply not possible to escape from poverty if what little people have is asset-stripped by predatory lenders. And this White Paper sets out tough measures to police and crack down on loan-sharks and other such rogue lenders.</p>
	<p>But it is also about providing consumers with the right information at the right time, so they can make informed decisions. Consumers need to be able to consider the key factors of a loan before they take it out. To do this they need clear, understandable information.</p>
	<p>New protections will go hand in hand with a series of changes to promote a more open, competitive market, offering more choice and less restriction.</p>
	<p>This White Paper proposes a range of legislative changes relevant to the credit market of today. It will be regulated in a way that provides consumers with choice, information and protection at the right time. It also outlines our plans for a strategic approach to minimising over-indebtedness and improving financial inclusion by educating consumers; providing easier access to financial advice; and ensuring access to affordable credit.</p>
	<p>I have placed copies of the White Paper and other related documents in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p>In November 2002 my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge), commissioned a quality review of the Initial Entry Rate (IER) statistic. The review, which was carried out independently in accordance with guidelines published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), was designed to ensure that the IER statistic was rigorous and transparent.</p>
	<p>The findings of the review were published on 17 November 2003. The main recommendations were that:</p>
	<p class="indent">The IER statistic should measure initial participation rather than initial entry and as such should be renamed the &quot;Higher Education Initial Participation Rate&quot; (HEIPR).</p>
	<p class="indent">Only those students who attend their course for at least six months will count toward the HEIPR.</p>
	<p class="indent">The HEIPR should be published to the nearest whole number.</p>
	<p>The most recent data available for these measurements are for the academic year 2001&ndash;02. The IER figure for 2001&ndash;02 was 43.5 per cent. When the recommendations of the quality review are taken into account, the new HEIPR figure for 2001&ndash;02 is 43.9 per cent. or 44 per cent. when rounded. Figures for 2002&ndash;03 will be produced when data become available.</p>
	<p>The full report is available via the ONS website and a copy has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p>The Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mike O'Brien) is to visit Pakistan imminently. Pakistan is an important ally and partner of the UK. We work closely with Pakistan in a number of fields, and our bilateral relationship is warm and close. Our mutual commitment to developing this relationship is shown by the successful visits to the United Kingdom by President Musharraf and Foreign Minister Kasuri during the course of 2003.</p>
	<p>Pakistan is a key partner for the UK in the campaign against terrorism. With US, UK and other international support, Pakistan has arrested over 500 terrorist suspects since 11 September 2001, including leaders like Khalid Sheikh Muhammad who is suspected of planning the attacks in New York. We also welcome and encourage measures taken by the Government of Pakistan against organisations which pose a threat to Pakistan's security and to regional and international stability, including efforts to root out the al-Qaeda and Taliban elements which continue to destabilise Afghanistan in particular.</p>
	<p>In the political sphere we value Pakistan's membership of the UN Security Council, and have welcomed their constructive contribution in that forum over the last year. We hope to continue and intensify our co-operation in the year ahead. We are also engaging with Pakistan on a whole range of regional and global issues, both bilaterally and in other international fora.</p>
	<p>We welcome recent progress in normalising relations between Pakistan and India, including the latest agreements on a ceasefire and resumption of air links. It has taken statesmanship by President Musharraf and Prime Minister Vajpayee to achieve the progress so far. This is an encouraging start to a process which we hope, with sustained efforts of both sides to address each others legitimate concerns, will lead to the resolution of all the outstanding issues between them, including on Kashmir.</p>
	<p>Our defence relationship is deepening following the re-establishment of the UK-Pakistan Defence Cooperation Forum in early 2002. We greatly value our important and historic links with the Pakistan armed forces. We will maintain and build on this progress.</p>
	<p>We have an important trade relationship. The UK is the biggest foreign investor in Pakistan and the UK is the country's 5th largest export market. All this is in the context of an increasingly stable and strong macro-economic environment in Pakistan, and a government committed to liberalising reform, including privatisation. We appreciate the good work being done in this field by the Pakistan-Britain Trade and Investment Forum (PBTIF), and the Pakistan Britain Business Advisory Group (PBBAG). The UK was also a strong supporter of the establishment of the EU/Pakistan Trade Agreement in late 2001.</p>
	<p>We are also working together in the field of judicial cooperation through the Joint Judicial Cooperation Working Group.</p>
	<p>The UK remains committed to supporting Pakistan's long-term development. We are giving approximately &pound;70 million of development assistance this year, four times more than previously, and last week agreed to the release of an additional tranche of &pound;22.5 million in budget support for the Government of Pakistan's long-term Poverty Reduction Strategy, and the Health and Population Welfare Facility. This bilateral programme is focused on social sector development&mdash;particularly in education and health&mdash;to make a difference to the lives of those millions of Pakistanis who live in poverty. UK development assistance for Pakistan will amount to over &pound;200 million over the next three years.</p>
	<p>Finally, there are of course strong community links between the UK and Pakistan. 800,000 people of Pakistani heritage are estimated to live in the UK. Over 85,000 Pakistanis visited the UK in 2003, including 6,000 students, and we expect this to rise to over 100,000 next year. Under normal circumstances our visa operation in Pakistan is one of the busiest in the world, and we are working hard to restore a full service following the disruption caused by terrorist threats to High Commission personnel.</p>

	<p>The Department will consider in more depth the issues raised by the Review and also issues raised by the Goodison Review on &quot;Saving Art for the Nation&quot;, which is due to be published later this week.</p>
	<p>Copies of the report will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The Review will also be available on the DCMS website <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">http://www.culture.gov.uk</a>.</p>
