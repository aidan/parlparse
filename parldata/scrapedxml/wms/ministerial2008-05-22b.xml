	Dissolved Companies (Restoration)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-05-22b.31WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development" colnum="31WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080522/wmstext/80522m0001.htm#08052262000080">
	<p pid="b.31WS.2/1">When part 31 of the Companies Act 2006 is commenced it will replace the provisions of the Companies Acts 1985 and 1989&mdash;and the equivalent Northern Ireland legislation&mdash;on restoration of dissolved companies to the register. The 2006 Act does not restate the bar, contained in the current legislation, on restoration of companies which were dissolved before <phrase class="date" code="1969-11-16">16 November 1969</phrase> (<phrase class="date" code="1971-03-11">11 March 1971</phrase> in Northern Ireland). This bar could be retained using separate powers under the 2006 Act. However, the Government do not propose to retain the bar.</p>
	<p pid="b.31WS.2/2">The current bar means that some ex-employees or their estates are unable to press claims for compensation in respect of personal injury or fatal accident, either against the employing company, its insurers or the financial services compensation scheme, simply because the company was dissolved prior to the cut-off date. Removing the bar, as the Government propose, may therefore enable such ex-employees or their estates to receive compensation which they are currently unable to obtain. This may be relevant in particular to sufferers of so-called long-tail diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.31WS.2/3">The relevant provisions of part 31 of the 2006 Act will be commenced with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-01">1 October 2009</phrase>. However, the Government take the view that, as it is proposed to remove the bar, it would be desirable to do so before then. The Government therefore propose to repeal the current bar with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October 2008</phrase>, as part of the next scheduled tranche of provisions to implement the 2006 Act. This repeal would therefore be done separately from the commencement of part 31 of the 2006 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.31WS.2/4">The Government are inviting comments on this approach by <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-04">4 July 2008</phrase>, and publishing a draft commencement order for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="b.31WS.4/1">The Government are pleased to be able to inform Parliament that the CBI and the TUC have reached an agreement on the way forward regarding equal treatment of agency workers. A copy of the joint declaration they agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase>, with Government support, has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.31WS.4/2">The Government consider that this declaration provides the basis for the introduction of measures to promote fairer treatment for agency workers while retaining the important flexibility that agency work can offer both employers and workers. One of the key issues on which agreement has been reached between the social partners is that there should be equal treatment of agency workers after 12 weeks in a given job.</p>
	<p pid="b.31WS.4/3">The Government hope this declaration can pave the way to agreement in the EU on the draft agency workers directive, and will now work with its European partners to that end, in order to bring the agreement between the CBI and the TUC into legal effect in the United Kingdom. The Government hope that EU agreement will be obtained in time for the necessary UK implementing legislation to be introduced in the next Parliamentary session.</p>

	<p pid="b.32WS.1/1">The Department will be placing the figures for the United Kingdom's stocks of civil plutonium and uranium as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase> in the Libraries of both Houses. In accordance with our commitment under the &quot;Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium&quot;, we will also send the figures to the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who will circulate them to member states. The figures will be available on the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the IAEA websites.</p>
	<p pid="b.32WS.1/2">The figures show that stocks of unirradiated plutonium in the UK totalled 108 tonnes at the end of 2007. Changes from the corresponding figures for 2006 are a consequence of continuing reprocessing operations&mdash;for example, as reflected in the increased quantity of unirradiated separated plutonium in product stores at reprocessing plants. The main reason for the change in high enriched uranium (HEU) stocks was the transfer to waste of recharacterised historic operational residues. The increase in the civil depleted, natural and low enriched uranium figures reflects the increased stocks at the UK enrichment plant.</p>
	<p pid="b.32WS.1/3">The stocks of civil plutonium and uranium in future years will be published on the HSE and IAEA websites without a written statement.</p>

These figures represent no overall change in the national figures from the previously published data, and show that 82 per cent. of families received an offer of a place at their highest preference school; and 94 per cent. of families received an offer of a place at one of their top three preferred schools.</p>

The Impact Study provides a comprehensive assessment of the claims management market and the impact of regulation on the industry. It concludes that the regulatory regime for claims management services is considered to have had a significant effect in reducing malpractice in its first full year of operation, one of the key objectives of regulation. Successes include dealing with cold calling in person, unauthorised advertising in hospitals and the misleading use of the term, &quot;no win, no fee&quot; which have all largely been eliminated</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-05-22b.36WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" speakername="Tom Harris" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport" colnum="36WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080522/wmstext/80522m0001.htm#08052262000088">
	<p pid="b.36WS.2/1">I am today announcing the publication of the consultation document for the South Central franchise. The formal accreditation process for bidders also starts today.</p>
	<p pid="b.36WS.2/2">Our overall aim for the new franchise is to ensure that continued improvement is maintained, while renewed emphasis is placed on improving the overall quality of the service offered to passengers.</p>
	<p pid="b.36WS.2/3">The new franchise will begin operation on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-20">Sunday 20 September 2009</phrase> and will cover the operations of Southern and Gatwick Express and the Tonbridge to Redhill route operated by Southeastern. The franchise will last for five years and ten months, with the final year dependent on performance. It will be possible for the franchise to be extended by up to two years, at the Department for Transport's discretion. The franchise is shorter than we would usually propose reflecting the major changes envisaged around 2015 when the Thameslink programme is complete. This approach gives the Government maximum flexibility when implementing the final Thameslink pattern of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.36WS.2/4">We have previously announced significant changes to services on the Brighton main line. These changes, which occur in December, will see some peak period Gatwick Express services extended to Brighton, increasing carrying capacity to and from the South Coast. The new franchise will start with this timetable as its base.</p>
	<p pid="b.36WS.2/5">The consultation document sets out the main challenges that the new franchise will face and highlights the key requirements that the Department proposes to include within the invitation to tender. The document includes details of likely service alterations to facilitate the delivery of a number of major infrastructure enhancements including the East London line extension, Thameslink programme and 10 car suburban rail network. It also sets out proposals to increase off peak services levels and improve security, access to stations, information provision and overall service quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.36WS.2/6">Responses to the consultation will inform the development of the invitation to tender (ITT) that bidders for each franchise will be asked to bid against. We expect to publish the ITT later this year and will award the new franchise early next summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.36WS.2/7">Last year's White Paper set out a challenging programme to improve our rail network, by increasing carrying capacity, improving reliability, enhancing stations, simplifying ticketing and improving service quality. This outline franchise specification builds on this. Over the coming weeks the Department will be having extensive discussions with local interested stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.36WS.2/8">The consultation will run until the <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-14">14 August 2008</phrase>. Copies of the consultation documents have been placed in the House Library, are available on the Department for Transport website at: <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a> and will be sent to key stakeholders.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-05-22b.37WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" speakeroffice="The Minister for Pensions Reform" colnum="37WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080522/wmstext/80522m0002.htm#08052262000089">
	<p pid="b.37WS.2/1">I have asked John Elbourne, former chief executive, Prudential Assurance UK Operations to examine the current arrangements for the engagement of older people and the ability of those arrangements to inform policy and actions of Government at all levels. Specifically, this will include examining Better Government for Older People's: aims, structure and relationships; past achievements, lessons learned and best practice; lines of accountability, governance and reporting; and management arrangements, legal status and funding. He will explore options for improvement of engagement with older people in respect of the new Government performance framework and in relation to the roles of other organisations. He will then make recommendations to ensure that the findings of the review take full account of the expectations of older people, best support the independence and wellbeing of people in later life and ensure an effective and efficient process to serve these needs.</p>
