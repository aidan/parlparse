	<p pid="b.59WS.2/1">Today the Department for Communities and Local Government is publishing an action plan in partnership with the Local Government Association setting out a substantive and exciting community empowerment agenda. I will be launching the plan at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations later this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/2">The document &quot;An Action Plan for Community Empowerment: Building on Success&quot; outlines proposals to create change at a very local level. The plan draws on existing good practice and brings together a range of actions to broaden and deepen empowerment activity. It forms an important strand of the Government's overall strategy for constitutional renewal, as set out in the Governance of Britain Green Paper. It will also be a building block to develop a cross-Government approach to community empowerment. It sets out activities in three key areas: widening and deepening empowerment opportunities locally; supporting and enabling people to take up those opportunities; and strengthening local representative democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.2/3">The document has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and can be accessed via the Communities and Local Government website at: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/communityempowermentactionplan">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/communities/communityempowermentactionplan</a></p>

	<p pid="b.59WS.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-18">18 July 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-07-18.460"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 460-464</phrase>, my right hon. Friend, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" name="Geoff Hoon">the Member for Ashfield (Mr Hoon)</phrase> the then Secretary of State for Defence, announced the publication of a new chapter to the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR) that was designed to ensure that our defence policies, capabilities and force structures matched the challenges that the new terrorist threats posed.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.5/2">Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) comprises: armed Tornado F3 and Typhoon aircraft held at ground readiness for immediate take-off; the Air Surveillance and Control System to provide warning and command and control of the fighter aircraft; and tanker aircraft also held at high ground readiness. QRA fulfils two concurrent functions. Firstly, it meets the United Kingdom's responsibility within NATO to provide air policing of agreed member airspace. Secondly, under UK national control, QRA provides an airborne contribution to countering threats against the UK by terrorist organisations or individuals. The SDR New Chapter confirmed that airfields across the UK&mdash;RAF Marham, RAF St Mawgan and RNAS Yeovilton&mdash;would be able to support QRA aircraft when needed, in addition to the bases from which the QRA aircraft usually operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.59WS.5/3">Following the decision to dispose of the airfield at RAF St Mawgan, we have reviewed the short term tertiary airfields that support quick reaction alert aircraft and decided that MOD Boscombe Down and RNAS Culdrose will now be enabled by Spring 2008 to cover any potential threats to the south and south-western airspaces. In the interim, RAF St Mawgan will continue to be utilised as necessary to support short term QRA aircraft. RAF Marham will continue to be maintained as a tertiary QRA airfield. This support is in addition to the bases that are already able to operate such aircraft and will give us enhanced flexibility in our air defence arrangements.</p>
