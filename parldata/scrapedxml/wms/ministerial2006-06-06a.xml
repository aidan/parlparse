	<p pid="a.19WS.10/1">I will be representing the UK at the Telecoms Council in Luxembourg on the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="">8 June 2006</phrase>. This is the only Telecoms Council under the Austrian presidency of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.10/2">The first item on the agenda will focus on EU e-Government policy. In response to a recently published Commission e-Government action plan, the presidency have prepared a set of Council conclusions looking at the priorities that need to considered in the area of e-Government policy. I intend to endorse these Council conclusions which are compatible with the UK Government's Transformational Government Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.10/3">The presidency will then introduce a policy debate on the future challenges for the electronic communications regulatory framework. This anticipates the Commission's forthcoming review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications markets. A Communication on this issue is expected in July and negotiation will formally begin under the German presidency. I will highlight some of the specific challenges that the UK would like to see addressed in the review of the framework. In particular, I plan to stress the need for effective implementation of the existing regulations and the importance of striking the right balance between maintaining competition, encouraging investment and protecting consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.10/4">The Austrian presidency may also informally ask for the views of Ministers on the Commission's forthcoming International Mobile Roaming Regulation. If they do, I will present the UK's initial views on this dossier, that we support the objective of reducing charges to consumers but have reservations about the Commission's approach on the regulation of retail prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.10/5">There will then be a short exchange of views on network and information security issues. If time allows, I may intervene under this agenda item to highlight the importance of discussions on this key issue and the need to consider carefully the most effective and proportionate way to address security concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.19WS.10/6">Finally, under &quot;Any Other Business&quot;, the Commission will provide some information on the first annual report on the i2010 strategy and on their recently published Communication on the World Summit on the Information Society. I do not expect to intervene under either of these items.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-06a.22WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" speakeroffice="The Minister for Energy" colnum="22WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/wmstext/60606m0057.htm#06060648000128">
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/1">There is an Energy Council in Luxembourg in the morning of <phrase class="date" code="">8 June</phrase>, at which the UK will be represented.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/2">Informal discussion at the pre-Council dinner on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June</phrase> will cover the European Commission's Green Paper: &quot;A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase>. The need for a new European Energy policy was one of the main agreed outcomes from discussion between EU Heads of Government at Hampton Court last October during the UK's presidency of the EU. Before the Council, the UK intends to submit its initial written response to the Green Paper. The UK's final response to the Green Paper will await the conclusions of the UK's domestic energy review.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/3">The main substantive item on the main Council agenda will be the internal energy (electricity and gas) market, on which Ministers will have a policy debate. The presidency has prepared questions to guide the debate and Ministers will be asked to agree Council conclusions on progress on the single market's implementation. The proper functioning of the single market in electricity and gas is a high priority for the UK. This item is expected to take up the bulk of the Council's time.</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/4">Under the agenda item of sustainable energy production and consumption, Ministers will be asked to agree Council conclusions on the Commission's Biomass action plan. Under the same heading, the Commission will provide information to the Council on two energy efficiency initiatives: the consultation process on the Commission's &quot;Energy Efficiency&quot; Green Paper and negotiations for an agreement between the US and European Community on the coordination of energy-efficient labelling programmes for office equipment (Energy Star II).</p>
	<p pid="a.22WS.1/5">The presidency or Commission will also provide information on International Relations in the field of Energy, encompassing the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty and the EU's relations with OPEC and with Russia.</p>
