	<p>On 17 December I informed the House of the receipt of a request from the United States Government to upgrade the early warning radar at Fylingdales for missile defence purposes.</p>
	<p>The Government has encouraged Parliamentary and public discussion of the issues involved. On 17 October, I informed the House of current work in the US on missile defence and, on 9 December, published a discussion paper, inviting interested parties to contribute their views. We have received a large number of responses both from individuals and organisations, and we have considered all contributions carefully. I have visited North Yorkshire to explain what the upgrade would involve and to hear at first hand the views of local people. We have engaged in initial discussions with the planning authorities. In an oral statement on 15 January, I informed the House of the Government's preliminary conclusion that it was in the UK's interest to agree to the US request. I gave evidence to the Defence Select Committee on the same day and addressed points raised by hon. Members in the defence debate on 22 January. I welcome the Select Committee's conclusion, in their report published on 29 January, that the UK should agree to the upgrade.</p>
	<p>In the course of these discussions we have been able to clarify that: the upgrade essentially comprises computer hardware and software modification, and involves no new development or change to the external appearance or power output of the radar; the radar will continue to fulfil its long-established ballistic missile early warning system (BMEWS) role; it will continue to be operated and staffed by the Royal Air Force, and we will continue to enjoy full access to its data; and the upgrade does not of itself commit the UK Government to any greater participation in the US missile defence programme. It does, however, keep open the prospect of acquiring missile defence capabilities for the UK, should we desire such protection at some point in the future. We will continue discussions with the local planning authorities on the detail of the upgrade work.</p>
	<p>I am now satisfied that we have been able to take fully into account the views of all interested parties in coming to a decision. I am therefore today replying to the United States Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, conveying the Government's agreement to the US request. We are separately negotiating a technical memorandum of understanding to give British industry the best possible opportunities to win work on the US programme.</p>

	<p>In April of last year my predecessor asked the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) for advice on the report of the rail industry's European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) programme team on how best to take forward the recommendations from the public inquiry on train protection systems jointly chaired by Professor Uff and Lord Cullen. I have now received the Commission's advice, in a letter to me of 5 February from the Commission Chair. I have placed a copy in the Library.</p>
	<p>The Commission says that the present programme of fitting the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS)</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;is already delivering real safety benefits&quot;. The Commission &quot;accepts that the Uff/Cullen timetable for installing ERTMS is not viable&quot; and that &quot;the current state of technology means that at the moment further use of health and safety law to mandate ERTMS is not appropriate&quot;. They endorse Level 2 as the best system for this country, although the Commission's consultants describe Level 2 as still at an early stage of development, and accept that Level 1 will reduce capacity. The Commission recommends that the Strategic Rail Authority take the lead in developing a single national programme for ERTMS development. I have accepted the HSC's advice.</p>
