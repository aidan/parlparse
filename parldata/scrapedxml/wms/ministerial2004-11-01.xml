	<p>The report &quot;Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service 2003&quot; prepared for the Cabinet Office by Aon Limited shows that the headline figure for the average level of sickness absence was 10.0 days per staff year. This represents a 0.2 days per staff year increase over the equivalent figure of 9.8 days set out in the report for 2002. The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the 2003 figures by department/agency. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p>Departments have established service delivery agreements, which contain their individual targets for reducing sickness absence. Overall, the civil service was targeted to reduce sickness absence by 30 per cent. (to 7.2 days per staff year) by 2003 against the 1998 baseline. In July 2004 my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced a review into the extent of short and long-term sickness within the civil service, and the results of that are due to be published shortly. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office is continuing to work with other departments and agencies as they take forward their plans to reduce sickness absence.</p>

	<p>Draft regulations and formal guidance implementing the Road Transport (Working Time) Directive (2002/15/EC) have today been published. A short six-week consultation exercise has been launched seeking views on both documents. This follows a full consultation exercise earlier this year on how the directive should be implemented. We are placing copies of the documents in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p>The regulations will provide extra protection for drivers and crew of heavy goods and public service vehicles, who carry out road transport activities covered by the EU Drivers' Hours Rules&mdash;Regulation (EEC) 3820/85. The main provisions of the regulations include:</p>
	<p class="indent">Weekly working time is limited to an average 48 hours.</p>
	<p class="indent">Up to 60 hours work can be performed in a single week, as long as the average 48-hour limit is maintained.</p>
	<p class="indent">Night workers are restricted to 10 hours working time in any 24-hour period.</p>
	<p class="indent">Some additional break requirements</p>
	<p>As announced on 29 April 2009, the draft UK regulations implement the following:</p>
	<p class="indent">Where there is either a collective agreement or a workforce agreement at company level between the employer and employees, firms will be able to use the derogations available under the directive:</p>
	<p class="indent">(a) The four-month reference period for calculating the average 48-hour week can be extended to six months.</p>
	<p class="indent">(b) The 10 hour limit, over a 24 hour period, for night workers can be exceeded, though the 60 hour weekly limit will still apply, and drivers will still have to respect EU driver's hours rules.</p>
	<p class="indent">The definition of &quot;night time&quot; is a period between 00.00&ndash;04.00 for drivers and crew of goods vehicles, and 01.00&ndash;05.00 for drivers and crew of passenger vehicles.</p>
	<p class="indent">VOSA (DVTA&mdash;NI) will enforce the new regulations; primarily in response to complaints they receive. This approach will be reviewed before March 2009.</p>
	<p class="indent">Self-employed drivers will not be covered by UK regulations until March 2009.</p>
	<p>In addition, under the draft Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations:</p>
	<p class="indent">Workers who occasionally perform road transport activities will be subject to the Working Time Regulations 1998 (as amended), rather than these new regulations.</p>
	<p class="indent">There is a new method of calculating average working time.</p>
	<p class="indent">Working time is restricted to road transport activities.</p>
	<p>Formal guidance for industry on the draft legislation, including the definitions (notably, working time and periods of availability) and occasional drivers is also available.</p>

	<p>On 27 January 2004 as part of the Department's wider programme of reform, the then Secretary of State announced that the disability and carers service (DCS) would be assigned formal executive agency status. Work to establish the agency is now complete. It will retain its current title, the disability and carers service, and is launched from today with Terry Moran appointed as chief executive.</p>
	<p>The role of DCS is to support disabled people and carers by providing a customer-focused service that delivers disability and carer benefits efficiently. These benefits comprise disability living allowance, attendance allowance, carer's allowance and vaccine damage payments.</p>
	<p>The 2004&ndash;05 targets for the DCS are contained within the disability and carers directorate business plan, a copy of which is available in the Library. Accountabilities for the DCS align with those of other departmental agencies and are set out within the departmental framework.</p>
	<p>DCS will embark on a significant programme of change by putting the experience of its customers at the heart of its plans to transform the service.</p>
	<p>I am confident that these changes will benefit the customers served by the DCS and support our agenda for improvements in public service generally and also achieve greater efficiency.</p>
