	<p pid="a.92WS.2/1">The action plan forms phase three of an agreement signed by the MOD and the EOC in June 2005 that outlined the MOD's commitment to tackling sexual harassment.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/2">To inform the action plan, MOD commissioned independent research into the nature and extent of sexual harassment in the Armed Forces, including a survey of all service women. The action plan demonstrates the MOD's commitment to tackling the serious issues highlighted by this research. It provides a clear undertaking to create an environment, through strong leadership, in which harassment is recognised as inappropriate and preventable.</p>

	<p pid="a.92WS.4/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-11">11 January 2005</phrase>, the then Secretary of State for Defence, announced to the House that we were undertaking a comprehensive review of the terms and conditions of service under which Gurkhas serve in the British Army, which would subsume an earlier review on married accompanied service for Gurkhas.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.4/2">I am pleased to be able to confirm that improved married accompanied service arrangements are being implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, and I hope our Gurkha soldiers will benefit from the much better opportunities to have their families with them at their permanent station. We have also been able to introduce national insurance contribution records for Gurkhas, so that they can qualify for the associated benefits, and they now pay food and accommodation charges, and are eligible for refunds, on the same basis as British soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.4/3">But the then Secretary of State for Defence warned that the review would be a major piece of work, and it has raised some very substantial and complex issues which I do not intend to press to hasty conclusions. Therefore, although at the time of the last statement it was hoped that the review could be completed by late autumn 2005, it is now unlikely that I will be able to make any further announcement until later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.94WS.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">My predecessor my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool and Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, informed the House of progress made by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in investigating the incident that occurred with the phase 1 clinical trial for a drug in development known as TGN1412, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-19">19 April 2006</phrase>, <i>Official Report,</i> cols 13-14WS. The MHRA is today publishing the final report of its investigations. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library and copies are available for hon. Members in the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/2">The report indicates that the adverse incidents did not involve errors in the manufacture of TGN1412 or in its formulation, dilution or administration to trial participants. The report does reference a number of procedural shortcomings that were brought to light by the MHRA's inspection. None of these was judged to have led to the adverse incidents suffered by the volunteers in this trial, but they are being followed up in the normal way through regulatory action with the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/3">The MHRA therefore confirms its conclusion set out in its interim report of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-05">5 April</phrase> that an unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans is the most likely cause of the adverse reactions in the trial participants. Monoclonal antibodies are a relatively new type of biological drug, although there are a number of them already licensed and in use. However, TGN1412 is a new class of monoclonal antibody which has a stimulatory mode of action affecting certain types of cell in the immune system. In this case the resulting activity seen in humans was not predicted from apparently adequate pre-clinical testing. This is a complex scientific issue which raises important scientific and medical questions about the potential risks associated with this type of drug and how to make the transition from pre-clinical testing to trials in humans.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/4">In the earlier written ministerial statement it was also announced that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had agreed to the establishment of an expert working group to consider what this incident reveals about the underlying science, and how clinical trials involving these types of products should be managed and authorised in the future. My right hon. Friend has appointed Professor Gordon Duff to chair the expert group. Professor Duff has now identified, and appointed on behalf of the Secretary of State, the members of his group which have today been announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/5">The terms of reference of the expert group are to consider what may be necessary in the transition from pre-clinical to first-in-man phase 1 studies, and in the design of these trials, with specific reference to:</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/6" class="indent">biological molecules with novel mechanisms of action;</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/7" class="indent">new agents with a highly species-specific action; and</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/8" class="indent">new drugs directed towards immune system targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/9">To provide advice in the form of a report to the Secretary of State for Health for the future authorisation of such trials with an interim report to be provided within three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.94WS.2/10">We will then provide a further report to the House when the expert group provides its interim report.</p>

	<p pid="a.100WS.2/1">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will be held on <phrase class="date" code="">1 June</phrase> in Luxemb<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" name="Anne McGuire">ourg. My hon. Friend the Minister for Disabled People (Anne McGuire)</phrase> will be representing the UK except for the item on the Working Time Directive where the UK will be represented by my right hon. Friend, theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">my hon. Friend, the Minister for Employment Relations and Minister for London (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>. Health and Consumer Affairs issues are being taken on <phrase class="date" code="">2 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/2">The first item is a policy debate on the review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. Member states were invited to submit a written response to three questions which have been tabled at all Councils. Additional questions have been posed about social inclusion to Employment and Social Policy Ministers. The Minister will contribute to the debate by stating that the most relevant link between the work of this Council and the Sustainable Development Strategy is through its focus on generating economic prosperity, more and better jobs and increasing social inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/3">The second item is on Social Services of General Interest. The Commission will give a presentation on its recent Communication which addresses the area of the legal uncertainty arising from the situation whereby the European Court of Justice is developing the law on social services on a case-by-case basis. The Social Protection Committee has drafted an Opinion on the Communication and the revised draft Services Directive. It generally welcomes both documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/4">The Council will reach partial general approach on both the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council implementing Regulation (EC) No 883/04 on the co-ordination of social security schemes and the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the co-ordination of social security systems, and determining the content of Annex XI.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/5">Ministers will be expected to endorse political agreement on the amended proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality. The proposal provides for the creation of a European Gender Institute to produce objective, reliable and comparative information on gender equality and data at national and European levels and to give visibility to gender equality. Its aim is to increase the opportunities for sharing knowledge, data and information on best practice, and facilitate networking.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/6">There will be Council conclusions on the Review of the implementation by the Member States and the EU institutions of the Beijing Platform for Action. Following the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995, the Council asked Member States to undertake an annual review of the implementation of the resulting Platform for Action. Each Presidency concentrates on different areas. The Austrian Presidency is looking at 'Women and Health' and has produced a report and a set of indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/7">There will be an endorsement of the joint contribution of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee on Flexicurity.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/8">There will be a Progress Report from the Presidency on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights. This is intended to make it easier for workers with occupational pensions to move around the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/9">The Council is being asked to reach political agreement on the amended proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity &mdash; PROGRESS. This is the EU-level spending programme for the period 2007-13, which will provide financial support for the implementation of the Community's objectives for employment and social affairs and the achievement of the Lisbon goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/10">The Council is being asked to reach political agreement on the annual Employment Guidelines on the proposal for a Council Decision on Guidelines for the Employment Policies of the Member States. The Guidelines set out the framework of common priorities for Member States' employment policies. In 2005 the Council agreed that the Guidelines should run for three years under the refocused Lisbon Strategy for Jobs and Growth. Member States will report on their employment policies in relation to the Guidelines as part of the new National Reform Programmes, to be published in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/11">The Council is also seeking political agreement on the amended proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time. The Working Time Directive, adopted in 1993, regulates maximum working hours and entitlements to rest breaks for workers. It sets out a maximum average working week of 48 hours although the UK retains an individual opt out from this provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.100WS.2/12">Under Any Other Business the Presidency will give a report on Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Globalisation adjustment Fund. There are six written items on Presidency conferences and information from the Portuguese delegation on the Council of Europe Ministers Conference on Family Matters: &quot;Changes in Parenting&quot;. The Commission is providing information on its recent Communications on &quot;Guidance on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services&quot;, &quot;Implementing the partnership for growth and jobs: Making European a 'pole of excellence' on corporate social responsibility&quot;, and &quot;Decent Work&quot; and &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities for all 2007&quot;. I do not expect any debate on these items.</p>
