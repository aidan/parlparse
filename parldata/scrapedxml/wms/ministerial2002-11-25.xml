	<p pid=".1WS.5/1">Further to my written answer of <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-19">19 July 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-07-19.334"><i>Official Report, </i>column 334&ndash;35W</phrase> scoping studies have confirmed that operational benefits, and significant savings, could be achieved by rationalising a number of specialist training streams along defence, rather than single-service lines. The studies identified benchmark options for providing the different types of training at existing MOD sites to serve as public sector comparators, against which a wider range of options can be considered. These will include partnering with the private sector, where potential private sector providers will be encouraged to propose innovative solutions, which might include proposals to establish training establishments on completely new sites. The selection, therefore, by a study of a benchmark site does not imply that the MOD has taken a firm decision to continue training on that site.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/2">The sites being examined for these benchmarks or public sector comparators are HMS Sultan for electro-mechanical engineering training; RAF Cosford for aeronautical engineering training; the Defence School of Transport at Leconfield for logistic training; the Defence Intelligence and Security Centre at Chicksands for security, intelligence, language and photography training; the Royal School of Signals at Blandford for communications and information systems training; and RAF Halton for joint personnel administration and police training.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/3">There are implications for other MOD sites at which elements of this training are currently being carried out. Sites where training may cease, and for which no alternative military use is currently envisaged, are: Bordon, Arborfield, Deepcut, Lodge Hill &amp; Chattenden, St Omer, Chichester, Worthy Down and Beaconsfield. Sites where some of the current training activity may be relocated are: Chatham, Marchwood, St Athan, RAF Cranwell, Shrivenham, HMS Collingwood (Gosport), RAF Digby, RAF Benson, RAF Brize Norton, Chatham, Grantham, Lympstone, Plymouth (including HMS Raleigh), Stafford, West Moors, Portsmouth and Wethersfield.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/4">The next stage of this work is to engage with industry to explore procurement options and to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective means of delivering this rationalised specialist training. Once this work is completed we will have a clearer picture of the likely locations of the various Defence Schools, and will be able to offer a more detailed assessment of the implications for other sites.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/5">Firm decisions on the future use of the sites will be made in the light of the evaluation of the options that emerge from our engagement with industry, and following the normal consultative process.</p>
	<p pid=".1WS.5/6">I have written to right hon. and hon. Members whose constituencies may be affected by these proposals.</p>

(<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-04-30.659">Official Report, Volume 384, Column 659W</phrase>). This statement sets out the progress to date on the review and advises hon. Members of the next steps that the Government intends to take.</p>
	<p pid=".2WS.4/2">Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, Dan Crompton, has conducted his annual inspection of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the focus of which was the impact of the new arrangements on police effectiveness and was therefore an important part of the Review. His report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-06">6 November</phrase>, and a copy was placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid=".2WS.4/3">My hon. Friend the Minister of State has been looking at detailed administrative and legislative issues and has completed a preliminary round of meetings with interested parties. The next step is to share draft clauses with the parties and to hold a further round of meetings. My hon. Friend is today writing to the parties and enclosing examples of how we intend to deal with the various commitments made in the implementation plan of August 2001 and other issues that have arisen during discussions on her strand of the review. In addition to these, she is enclosing, for consultation, text setting out how the Government might deal with two further issues which, in the implementation plan, we undertook to consider further. Her letter&mdash;a copy of which will be will be placed in the Library of the House&mdash;explains that the Government consider that the time is not yet right to legislate on these matters.</p>
	<p pid=".2WS.4/4">And finally, the Oversight Commissioner, Tom Constantine, has, under his terms of reference, been reviewing the progress made in implementing Patten on the basis of experience during the first year of the board's operation. I expect his report in early December.</p>
	<p pid=".2WS.4/5">It is my intention to introduce legislation to Parliament before the Christmas Recess.</p>
