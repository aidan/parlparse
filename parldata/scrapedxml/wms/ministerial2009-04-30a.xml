	Primary Curriculum Review
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-04-30a.56WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families" colnum="56WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090430/wmstext/90430m0001.htm#09043031000230">
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/1">As part of the Children's Plan, we committed to a fundamental review of the primary curriculum, and I was delighted that Sir Jim Rose accepted my invitation to carry out this important work. The remit for the review was to consider how to:</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/2" class="indent">Ensure that the primary curriculum builds on prior learning in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and supports transition to and children's readiness for secondary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/3" class="indent">Increase flexibility and reduce prescription where possible to allow teachers more freedom to tailor the curriculum to their pupils' interests, different and developing abilities and local circumstances to ensure that no child is left behind and to narrow achievement gaps.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/4" class="indent">Continue the focus on the crucial skills of literacy and numeracy, while recognising the increasing learning opportunities opened up by advances in technology in the last decade and children's increasing ICT capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/5" class="indent">Give a greater emphasis to children's personal development and well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/6" class="indent">Balance these priorities with children's entitlement to a broad and balanced primary curriculum which introduces them to the arts, sciences, humanities, physical education and sport and foreign languages as they progress through primary education.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/7">In addition, I asked Sir Jim to consider how to improve outcomes for summer-born children, including considering when they should start school. During the review I asked Sir Jim to consider two of the EYFS early learning goals for writing as part of his wider review of improving transition from EYFS into primary Key Stage 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/8">Sir Jim's interim report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-08">8 December</phrase> and has been subject to widespread consultation with teachers, parents, learned societies, subject experts and other professionals. He has now completed his final report, which I am publishing today along with proposals for a revised primary national curriculum. Hard copies are being placed in the Libraries of both Houses. I am accepting all of his recommendations subject to public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/9">Sir Jim has made a number of recommendations directly related to the design and content of the primary curriculum which will require legislation, which I have accepted subject to public consultation which I have asked the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to carry out from today. They will also consult on the proposals to make personal, social, health and economic education statutory that I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">Monday 27 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/10">Sir Jim proposes a new core of essential skills for learning and life focused on literacy, numeracy, ICT and personal development and learning which is embedded across the whole curriculum. This will help ensure that all children leave school secure in the basics. Sir Jim's recommendations also include restructuring the primary curriculum into six broad areas of learning, within which essential subject content will be organised and become more distinct as children progress from Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/11">The areas of learning are:</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/12" class="indent">understanding English, communication and languages;</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/13" class="indent">mathematical understanding;</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/14" class="indent">understanding the arts;</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/15" class="indent">historical, geographical and social understanding;</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/16" class="indent">understanding physical development, health and wellbeing;</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/17" class="indent">scientific and technological understanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/18">The draft programmes of learning for these areas set out the knowledge, skills and understanding which children should learn linked to the overall aims of helping children become successful learners, confident individuals and responsible citizens. The curriculum content is set out in three clear phases to help teachers plan for progression. Sir Jim also recommends that a foreign language should become compulsory for the first time from age 7, building on the recommendation of the languages review carried out by the late Lord Dearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/19">A number of other significant recommendations do not require legislation and I plan to take them forward subject to the forthcoming consultation. These will support and promote the successful implementation of the new curriculum from September 2011. These include promoting what Sir Jim has already seen as excellent practice in some of our best primary schools relating to teaching reading and encouraging children's spoken communication skills. He has also concluded that we should retain the two writing early learning goals as aspirational targets and that the Government should make available guidance and support to smooth children's transition from the EYFS to primary school, including supporting those children still working towards these goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/20">Other recommendations relate to helping schools plan for implementing the new curriculum, such as the Government supporting teachers' professional development needs to deliver our increased expectations around ICT. Given the fundamental nature of the changes and the important contribution that I expect the new curriculum to make to children's attainment and well-being, I have agreed that primary schools should be permitted an additional training day in 2010 to give every school the time and opportunity to plan for the new curriculum from September 2011. A full set of Sir Jim's recommendations and my response is set out in the annex to this statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/21">On the question of when summer-born children should start school, I have accepted Sir Jim's recommendation that children should ideally start school in the September immediately following their fourth birthday, possibly on a part-time basis for some children, but with parents having freedom to choose. He has taken account of the compelling evidence on the benefits to summer-born children from starting school at the same time as their peers and that the majority of local authority areas already operate a single point of primary school entry in September. Young disabled children and children with SEN in particular will benefit from starting school as soon as possible so that the right interventions are put in place to ensure that these children also make progress alongside their fellow pupils. I am mindful however, that compulsory school age does not start until the term after a child turns five and that some parents have a strong preference for their child's early years experience to take place outside a school setting. I therefore intend to make funding available across the maintained, private and voluntary sectors to enable all children to receive full time provision in education and childcare from the September after their fourth birthday. Alongside making that provision available, we will ensure that parents have clear information about the benefits of beginning reception in September and we will work to help schools and early years settings to smooth the transition for any children who move into reception after September.</p>
	<p pid="a.56WS.5/22">I am enormously grateful to Sir Jim for the rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based way in which he has undertaken this major review. He has consulted widely with subject experts, learned societies, teachers and other professionals, and his review is informed by excellent practice in our best schools and internationally. Throughout the review he has kept in the forefront of his thinking the interests of children and their parents. I am confident that his work will make a huge difference to millions of young people, helping to ensure their primary years equip them with the knowledge, skills and understanding they need to thrive in their future education and later lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.62WS.6/1">I am today placing in the Library of the House and on the MOD website, a copy of two reports &quot;The Puma Force&mdash;A Review of Contemporary Operating Issues&quot; and the earlier report &quot;A Strategic Review of the Puma Helicopter Force&quot;. These reports were undertaken by the Ministry of Defence as a prudent step following a number of Puma helicopter incidents in 2007. The reports are a comprehensive and honest examination of a wide range of issues, including Puma Force culture, training, flying and operational requirements, structure, leadership and management.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.6/2">&quot;A Strategic Review of the Puma Helicopter Force&quot; was written for internal consumption and consequently contains sensitive information that we have needed to redact. I realise that this can make the document difficult to read and that is why &quot;The Puma Force&mdash;A Review of Contemporary Operating Issues&quot; was written and is also being published. This is an unclassified report, specifically designed to provide a clear narrative and allow the reader to better understand the context in which a series of incidents occurred and the actions taken and planned as a result. As a consequence of the latter, the Puma Force's capability has been enhanced and the management of safety improved to minimise the risk of further accidents. Clearly, operational flying can never be risk free.</p>
	<p pid="a.62WS.6/3">I would stress that there is no suggestion in the documents that the Puma is in any way unsafe to fly.</p>

	<p pid="a.63WS.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-17">17 March 2009</phrase> the Healthcare Commission, the independent health regulator, published its comprehensive report into the severe failings in emergency care provided by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and mid 2008. It was a catalogue of appalling management and failures at every level for which I apologised on behalf of the Government and the NHS in my oral statement to the House the next day.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.5/2">I announced at the same time a range of measures, including two swift reviews into the circumstances at Mid Staffordshire to be led by Professor Sir George Alberti, National Clinical Director for Emergency Care and Dr David Colin-Thom&eacute;, National Clinical Director for Primary Care.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.5/3">Professor Alberti has looked at the hospital's procedures for emergency admissions and treatment and its progress against the recommendations in the Healthcare Commission's report. In addition, he looked at other related areas of work, including the quality of care issues highlighted in the report in relation to the medical admission wards 10, 11 and 12.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.5/4">Dr Colin-Thom&eacute; looked into the circumstances surrounding the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust prior to the Healthcare Commission's investigation to learn lessons about how the primary care trust and strategic health authority, within the commissioning and performance management systems that they operate, failed to expose what was happening in this hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.5/5">Those two reports were submitted me on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-29">29 April</phrase> and we are today placing copies in the Library together with the Government's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.5/6">The trust and the Government have accepted all of the recommendations of these reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.5/7">The new Health and Social Care regulator, the Care Quality Commission will, together with Monitor and the PCT, take stock with the trust after three months. The CQC will do a follow-up review in six months. Monitor, the independent regulator for FTs, will hold monthly meetings with the trust to ensure it implements all of the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.5/8">The NHS chief executive David Nicholson will be writing to NHS organisations to bring these reports to their attention and asking them to ensure they implement all of the recommendations that are relevant to them. Monitor will be writing in similar terms to foundation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.63WS.5/9">The Healthcare Commission report identified severe failings at Stafford Hospital. While much has been done to rectify these, the two reports indicate that work still needs to be done to ensure quality of care at the hospital reaches the highest standard. Swift and decisive action is being taken to ensure that is the case. Stafford hospital was exceptional, not typical, but all those working in the NHS can learn from this experience so that such events do not occur again elsewhere.</p>

In addition, to ensure that money is directed to those who are in the most need, the Secretary of State will be making changes to the discretionary social fund.

This is because of the introduction of a requirement for third and subsequent living expense crisis loan applications to be usually completed at a face to face interview at a Jobcentre Plus local office.
