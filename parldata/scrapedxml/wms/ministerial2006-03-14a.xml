	<p pid="a.95WS.2/1">I would like to inform the House that the UK and the US withdrew our monitors from the Jericho Monitoring Mission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March</phrase>. As I made clear in my statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-29">29 April 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-04-29.668"><i>Official Report</i>, column 668</phrase>, it is the prime responsibility of the Palestinian Authority to ensure the personal security of the United States and United Kingdom monitors. Over the last months it has become increasingly clear that the Palestinian Authority is unable to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.95WS.2/2">The UK and the US have repeatedly raised our concerns over the security of our monitors with the Palestinian Authority and urged them to meet their obligations under the Ramallah agreement. Unfortunately, there has been no improvement. We therefore issued a joint US/UK letter to President Abbas on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March 2006</phrase>. This letter said that we would have to terminate our involvement with the mission if the Palestinian Authority did not immediately either fully comply with the Ramallah Agreement (which sets out monitoring arrangements) and make substantive improvements to the security of the monitors or come to a new agreement with the Government of Israel. As required by the Ramallah Agreement we informed the Israeli Authorities that we were delivering a letter in these terms. I have placed a copy of this letter in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.95WS.2/3">The Palestinian Authority has consistently failed to meet its obligations under the Ramallah Agreement. Ultimately the safety of our personnel has to take precedence. It is with regret that I have to inform the House that these conditions have not been met and we have terminated our involvement with the mission today, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March 2006</phrase>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-14a.96WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" speakeroffice="The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality" colnum="96WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060314/wmstext/60314m02.htm#60314m02.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.96WS.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-03">3 January</phrase> this year <i>The Sun</i> newspaper published allegations made by an ex-employee about working practices at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's (IND's) Public Enquiry Office (PEO) in Croydon. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase> I said that Tim Gbedemah, a non-executive director of IND, would lead a formal inquiry into these allegations, with the following terms of reference:</p>
	<p pid="a.96WS.2/2" class="indent">&quot;To investigate the allegations about practices within the Public Enquiry Office at Lunar House in Croydon, which Mr. Anthony Pamnani was reported to have made by The Sun newspaper on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-03">3 January</phrase>; to establish, as far as possible, their substance; and to make any recommendations for further action to the director general of IND, in the light of any findings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.96WS.2/3">The report has now been completed and is available in full via the IND internet site at: <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. A copy has also been laid in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.96WS.2/4">I am pleased to say that the investigation found no evidence to support <i>The Sun's</i> central allegation that there was a corruption &quot;racket&quot; in the Public Enquiry Office involving &quot;sex for visas&quot;. Some isolated incidents of unprofessional behaviour have been identified and the report indicates there may be evidence of further misconduct by some members of staff. It also identified some failures to follow the correct procedures for carrying out security checks on certain applicants. We take these findings very seriously. We will now ensure that appropriate action is taken to address them, including where necessary taking disciplinary action.</p>
	<p pid="a.96WS.2/5">Importantly, the report also makes the point that its findings must be seen in context and acknowledges the significant improvements that have been made. In the period under examination the PEO decided around half a million cases. We are justifiably proud of the hard work and professionalism of the overwhelming majority of staff in the Public Enquiry Office and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.96WS.2/6">The director general of IND and I are very grateful for Mr. Gbedemah's work. We accept all of his recommendations and I am asking the director general to put together an action plan to take them forward. We are committed to improving continually and we will look at how we can positively apply the lessons learned across the whole of IND.</p>
