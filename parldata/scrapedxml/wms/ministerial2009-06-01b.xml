	<p pid="b.1WS.5/1">Further to the statement laid on this issue on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-23">23 February 2009</phrase>, the first five eligible applicants to take up the Government's resettlement scheme for vulnerable and older British people in Zimbabwe arrived in the UK this weekend. They will resettle permanently near to their family or friends in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.5/2">The cross-Government scheme, which is being co-ordinated by the Department for Communities and Local Government, was opened three months ago to help a small group of British people in Zimbabwe who are 70 and over or who are vulnerable because of their care needs or medical conditions but are unable to make their own arrangements to resettle in the UK. The British embassy is not advising British people to leave Zimbabwe and continues to provide a full range of consular services to those who remain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.5/3">The scheme was developed with the active involvement and support of individual local authorities, the Local Government Association, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, housing associations and charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.5/4">To date, there has been steady interest in the scheme. As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-26">26 May</phrase>, we had received 61 applications for resettlement under the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1WS.8/1">As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and I made clear, publicly, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-25">25 May</phrase>, we strongly condemn the nuclear test carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). This action was wrong, misguided, dangerous, and a clear breach of UN Security Council Resolution 1718 (2006). It will undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula and do nothing for North Korea's security. By carrying out this test in the face of united efforts by members of the international community to bring peace and security to the Korean peninsula, North Korea will find itself even more isolated and scorned by the international community. T he Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" name="Bill Rammell">the Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell)</phrase> expressed our strong condemnation of the nuclear test to the DPRK ambassador to London on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-25">25 May</phrase>, and will meet him again today to underline our concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.8/2">North Korea's action in conducting this nuclear test represents a clear challenge to the security of neighbouring countries, and to international security. It also gives rise to further concerns about proliferation. DPRK's actions since <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-25">25 May</phrase> in testing short-range missiles and threatening to end the Armistice Agreement of 1953 are provocative and aggressive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.8/3">In conducting this nuclear test, the DPRK authorities have chosen to ignore not only the Security Council's demands but also the repeated warnings from many Governments, including the UK, to desist from provocative actions. The six-party talks process offers a forum for discussion of legitimate issues between the countries involved. But North Korea has walked away from these talks. They remain the right vehicle for the long-term goal of ensuring stability on the Korean peninsula. In the meantime we support active steps to contain the danger.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.8/4">The UN Security Council has already issued a very clear statement of condemnation and opposition to the nuclear test. The UK is now working with Security Council partners to develop a tough new resolution imposing sanctions, which will increase the pressure on DPRK following previous resolutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.8/5">If North Korea is to take its rightful place within the international community, it needs to respect international norms, abide by its international obligations as set out in successive UN Security Council Resolutions and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, end its aggressive policies towards its region and the rest of the world, and engage constructively with international partners, including through the six-party talks process. The Government and people of North Korea have much to gain from such re-engagement with the international community.</p>
	<p pid="b.1WS.8/6">The nuclear test also highlights the critical importance of revitalising the non-proliferation treaty and securing entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty. The international community needs to demonstrate that it does not tolerate proliferation of this sort.</p>
