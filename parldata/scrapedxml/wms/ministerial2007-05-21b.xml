	<p pid="b.55WS.2/1">Budget 2006 announced that the second Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) would be informed by a series of policy reviews. One of the reviews announced at the Budget was a joint HM Treasury and Department for Education and Skills policy review of children and young people. This included a sub-review on how services can provide greater support to families with disabled children to improve their life chances.</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.2/2">The Government are today publishing the final report of the disabled children review, to inform and influence the CSR. In line with the Government's report, &quot;Improving the life chances of disabled people&quot;, the review has worked towards the best ways of creating equality for all disabled children. Improving their educational, social and emotional development, and their opportunities for independent living, choice and control, is a key part of this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.2/3">The final report, published today, sets out the further action that needs to be taken to improve outcomes and equality of opportunity for disabled children and their families. It aims to facilitate, better support, and improve outcomes for disabled children in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.2/4" class="indent">empowering disabled children, young people and their families&mdash;offering parents and their disabled children choice and the power to take decisions about their own care and influence local priorities, to improve service quality and responsiveness;</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.2/5" class="indent">promoting more responsive services and timely support&mdash; prioritising disabled children at a local and national level, with early interventions and coordinated and timely support, to bring up standards of provision across the country, make it easier for families to access holistic support, and prevent conditions deteriorating.</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.2/6" class="indent">improving service quality and capacity&mdash;boosting provision of services which are vital for improving outcomes for disabled children and their families. The Review focuses mainly on specialist services such as short breaks and equipment, but also tackles barriers to accessing universal services such as healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.2/7">Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.55WS.5/1">I am pleased to announce today that the MOD has placed an order with BAE Systems to commence work on the build of the fourth submarine in the Astute Class, which will be known as Audacious.</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.5/2">The Astute class is the next generation of nuclear powered attack submarines. The First of Class, Astute, is on schedule to be launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-08">8 June 2007</phrase>, and is due to enter service in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.5/3">The Astute Class will be the largest, most capable and widely deployable attack submarines that the Royal Navy has ever operated, and will replace the Swiftsure and Trafalgar Class, which have been in-service since the 1970s and 1980s respectively. The Astute Class will have improved communications systems to support joint operations and an enhanced ability to operate in shallower littoral environments. BAES (Submarine Solutions) is also responsible for the design and build of the first three boats (Astute, Ambush and Artful).</p>
	<p pid="b.55WS.5/4">Today's announcement demonstrates our commitment to the attack submarine programme, as set out in the Defence Industrial Strategy. It also demonstrates our commitment to the Royal Navy. These submarines are needed to fulfil duties around the globe. It demonstrates the best of British technology and our determination to develop and transform the UK submarine industry over the coming years.</p>

	Agriculture Development Scheme
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-05-21b.57WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="57WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070521/wmstext/70521m0001.htm#07052112000154">
	<p pid="b.57WS.2/1">The Agriculture Development scheme (ADS) is an Exchequer-funded, competitive scheme which has operated in its present form since 2003 to help farmers and other bodies within the food chain to improve their competitiveness through better marketing. Details of the projects that have been supported under ADS may be found on DEFRA's website. The projects that have been supported have, in all cases, been ones that were originally proposed by bodies within the industry itself. The priorities of the scheme have been the encouragement of co-operation and collaboration benefiting primary producers, giving backing to benchmarking and the spread of best practice, promotion and development of assurance schemes, and opening up new markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.2/2">Independent evaluations that have been carried out of the effectiveness of ADS have shown that the projects which it has supported have been highly successful in meeting these objectives, and that the scheme as a whole has been responsible for significantly improving the degree of market orientation shown by the food chain generally. I should like to pay tribute to the energy and commitment of those who have been responsible for delivering these projects, and for achieving these results.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.2/3">The independent evaluations that I have referred to also made reference to the need to keep the scheme priorities under review, and have pointed out the need for support to be given to projects aimed at achieving specific environmental and sustainability criteria. Accordingly, I have decided that the time has come to reassess the scheme priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.2/4">After bids have been received for the next ADS panel that will be held later this year, the scheme in its present form will be closed to new applications. Projects currently being supported under ADS will be unaffected. This decision will be publicised via the media and DEFRA's website, and also communicated in writing to agricultural organisations, food chain bodies, and other interested parties. Potential applicants for ADS funding will be given notice of the date by which their bids must be received in order to be considered by the adjudication panel later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.2/5">It should be noted that after the new 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme for England has been approved by the European Commission, funding may be available under Axis 1 of that programme for projects concerned with the same kinds of priorities as have applied since 2003 under ADS. That funding will be managed by Regional Development Agencies, in line with the regional priorities which each of those Agencies set out in their Axis 1 implementation plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.57WS.2/6">A further announcement will be made in due course about successor arrangements for ADS.</p>
