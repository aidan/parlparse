	<p pid=".73WS.2/1">In 2000, the Government published figures on the area of land designated as green belt in England, based on figures in plans that had been adopted by 1997. I am pleased to announce today the publication of statistics that show changes to the amount of green belt since then. In future, such figures will be published on an annual basis, and will be used to monitor the Government's target to maintain or increase the amount of green belt in each region.</p>
	<p pid=".73WS.2/2">The statistics show that since 1997 there has been an increase of around 25,000 hectares in the amount of green belt identified in adopted local and unitary development plans in England. In addition, there are proposals for an additional 12,000 hectares of green belt that are currently being taken forward in plans that have not yet reached adoption. This figure does not include changes to the green belt proposed in the New Forest, where land will be re-designated from green belt to national park once the national park has been formally designated. This comprises some 46,000 hectares of land in the area covered by New Forest district council. In view of this re-designation, the Government does not intend that these figures should be included in monitoring progress towards its target of maintaining or increasing the amount of green belt in each region.</p>
	<p pid=".73WS.2/3">Copies of the statistical release are available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid=".73WS.4/1">We have today launched a public consultation on implementing Part 8 of the Antisocial Behaviour Act 2003 in England. This gives local authorities the powers to deal with complaints about high hedges that are having an adverse affect on a neighbour's amenity.</p>
	<p pid=".73WS.4/2">We are seeking views on draft regulations covering certain procedural details such as the fees that authorities should charge for this service and how appeals against their decisions should be dealt with. We are also seeking views on the draft guidance on how local authorities should administer the complaints system. This offers advice on how authorities should assess whether a hedge is having an adverse affect on a neighbour's amenity. Copies of the consultation paper and the draft guidance have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid=".73WS.4/3">The consultation papers have been sent to local authorities in England, specialist and other interested organisations. They have also been published on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's web site <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a>. The closing date for responses is <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".74WS.2/1">The House will wish to be aware of developments on the Government's plans for modernising civil registration.</p>
	<p pid=".74WS.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-10">10 July 2003</phrase> the Government published the consultation paper &quot;<i>Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change&quot;.</i> This set out our proposals to reform civil registration in England and Wales using powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. The proposed changes will make it easier both for citizens to deal with Government at key points in their lives and in the lives of their families and for the Government to modernise this public service by exploiting improved information and communication technology. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that there were almost 3,400 responses to the consultation document. This indicates the very real interest amongst a wide range of stakeholders&mdash;registration practitioners and managers, the public and other interested organisations&mdash;in this area of reform.</p>
	<p pid=".74WS.2/3">Our intention was to introduce a regulatory reform order in this Session of Parliament. This remains the case in respect of provisions relating to registration of births and deaths and access to birth and death records. I have however decided to postpone the presentation of provisions relating to marriage till early in the next Session. The splitting of the proposals in this way will ensure that the momentum for reform is sustained whilst, at the same time, providing an opportunity for the second regulatory reform order to take account of Parliament's wishes on the civil partnership legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".74WS.2/4">This strategy will not hinder the Government's plans for implementation that will begin in 2005 with improved information technology to forward registration information to the Registrar General and the structural reform of the local registration service.</p>

	<p pid=".75WS.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-19">19 July 2001</phrase>, I informed the House that, after years of delay and forecast cost growth, we had selected a preferred supplier to take forward the BOWMAN programme. Although our approved in service date was December 2004, we set a demanding target to deliver by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-30">30 March 2004</phrase>. This target is just 30 months from the September 2001 contract awarded to General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd, a challenge unprecedented on such a major and complex acquisition project. Our priority was to deliver a secure, reliable voice communications replacement for Clansman and I am pleased to report to the House that BOWMAN has achieved its in service date on this basis, ahead of the target. This achievement and the capability it provides will enable the programme to progress to its next key milestone, the delivery of war fighting capability in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".75WS.6/2">Once fully implemented, BOWMAN will provide a secure tactical+ voice and data communications system for our land forces and selected elements of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, until at least 2025. As well as being man-portable, it will be an integral part of the communications fit of major equipments such as warships, main battle tanks and helicopters. The provision of secure voice communications down to section level represents a step-change in capability for the armed forces as they migrate from Clansman to BOWMAN. Other functions which BOWMAN is designed to deliver, such as automatic position reporting and an ability to pass digital data around the battlefield have been demonstrated in principle on field trials and their development is on course.</p>
	<p pid=".75WS.6/3">At the end of 2002, nearly a year and a half into the BOWMAN contract, we extended it to further develop the battle management system and to enhance integration with systems and sensors on board our key armoured platforms&mdash;a programme known as CIP. A key advantage of aligning both programmes is that time and cost are saved through converting vehicles only once. There has been positive progress on CIP but the performance of the battle management system in recent field trials leads us to conclude that a few more months of work will be required to develop and fully demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".75WS.6/4">BOWMAN will provide a marked increase in operational tempo, firepower lethality and survivability across all our armed services and will be a key enabler for the UK's network-enabled capability. There is a widespread commitment to BOWMAN across the services and industry stakeholder community and it has already demonstrated greater military capability overall than Clansman. The first brigade converted to BOWMAN will undertake a further 15 months of unit and collective performance training, and as with the programme hitherto, the brigade will be closely involved in the development and proving of BOWMAN.</p>
	<p pid=".75WS.6/5">Achieving the BOWMAN in service date is an important step on the road to the ultimate goal, delivering a robust war fighting capability that fully meets the requirements of the user in service. It is a key milestone on the path to achieving war fighting operational readiness in 2005 and represents a huge success for smart acquisition as well as a big step forward for the British armed forces.</p>

	<p pid=".76WS.1/1">In 1992, the then Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, conducted a review of the safety of nuclear weapons. It was reported to Parliament House of Commons, <phrase class="date" code="1992-07-13">13 July 1992</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1992-07-13.520"><i>Official Report</i>, column 520</phrase>, that he had recommended the inauguration of a safety &quot;champion&quot;. A position entitled Nuclear Weapon Safety Adviser was subsequently created, and this has had two incumbents. More recently, further work has been done on safety management arrangements in the Department in general, and in the nuclear programmes in particular, to reflect policy and organisational developments. As a result, we have appointed a Nuclear Weapon Regulator to provide assurance about safety in the nuclear weapons programme. In so doing, it was recognised that the tasks of this official would be very similar to those of the Nuclear Weapon Safety Adviser, and it was decided that, when the regulator was ready to conduct business, the safety adviser post should close. This has recently occurred.</p>

	<p pid=".77WS.4/1">I am today announcing that contracts have been signed with four private sector companies to provide debt collection services to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The contractors are Commercial Collections Services, Eversheds, Legal and Trade Collections and the Lewis Group.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/2">The contractors will provide support with two categories of debt: benefit debt and commercial debt. They will act as recovery agents, earning commission on amounts recovered and passed to DWP. The ownership of the debt will remain with DWP at all times.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/3">The contracts will offer support to our existing debt management operations rather than replacing or outsourcing them. There will be no job reductions in DWP as a result of this announcement. So DWP will continue to handle negotiation and civil enforcement of debts in-house. The cases transferred will be those where DWP has been unsuccessful.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/4">The contractors will adhere to strict contractual controls on their behaviour and DWP will put robust contract management processes in place to ensure compliance. Contractors will also have to adhere to the codes of conduct of their own supervising bodies (e.g. the Credit Services Association or the Law Society) and also the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/5">Benefit debt includes overpaid benefits, where the overpayment is caused by customer error, and outstanding social fund loans. The debts transferred will be those where the debtor is not currently in receipt of a DWP benefit, they have refused to repay voluntarily and DWP has been unable to obtain full recovery. Each debtor will be given the opportunity to make an arrangement to repay their debt before their case is transferred to one of the contractors.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/6">DWP has a number of categories of debts owed by commercial organisations including:</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/7" class="indent">money owed by insurance companies by way of compensation for NHS costs following Road Traffic Accidents and repayment of Social Security benefits following compensation awards;</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/8" class="indent">recoupment from employment tribunal awards&mdash;where employers are required to repay social security benefits paid to employees following, for example, unfair dismissal;</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/9" class="indent">amount owed through contracts such as European social fund, training and general supplies.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/10">As with benefit debt, the organisations owing money will be given the opportunity to make an arrangement to repay DWP before the case is transferred to the private sector for collection.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/11">There are three main purposes to this exercise:</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/12" class="indent">to reduce the debts outstanding to the Department;</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/13" class="indent">to reinforce the message that debts have to be repaid, especially those that arose as a result of fraud;</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/14" class="indent">to learn from the private sector and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of DWP's Debt Management organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".77WS.4/15">The contract will be for an initial two-year period to March 2006, with the possibility of extension. First cases will be transferred towards the end of April 2004 with each Contractor receiving an initial tranche of 50,000 cases. After this initial allocation there is no guarantee of additional cases being referred.</p>

	Social Fund
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-03-29.79WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1162" speakername="Chris Pond" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions" colnum="79WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040329/wmstext/40329m03.htm#40329m03.html_spmin0">
	<p pid=".79WS.1/1">I am pleased to announce that the gross discretionary social fund budget for 2004&ndash;05 will be &pound;689 million. This includes a further increase in net treasury funding of &pound;10 million, which is additional to last year's extra &pound;20 million. This means that net funding is now &pound;30 million higher than in 2002&ndash;03, and is the second of three annual increases from a &pound;90 million boost for the discretionary social fund announced in the autumn 2002 pre-budget report.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/2">After careful consideration, we have decided to allocate all the extra net funding to community care grant needs. We have therefore increased the community care grant (CCG) budget by &pound;10 million. This is a further significant increase that will help the most vulnerable. It has been distributed so that every district benefits by an increase in their CCG budget and districts move closer to meeting the same proportion of demand nationally.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/3">The gross loans budget for 2004&ndash;05 will be &pound;560 million, which represents an increase of &pound;2 million over the April 2003 allocation. The increase is owing to higher loan recoveries and setting a lower contingency reserve than 2003&ndash;04. To maintain fairness within the scheme, the loans budget will continue to be allocated to districts to support consistency of outcome for applicants wherever they live.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/4">The sum of &pound;l million will be retained centrally as a contingency reserve, which, for example will provide additional help to districts facing unexpected and unplanned expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/5">Details of individual district budget allocations have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/6">The discretionary social fund budget is cash limited. Budgets are allocated to districts on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase> each year.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/7">The gross discretionary SF budget allocated for 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;689 million made up of:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".79WS.1/10"> <th></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".79WS.1/13"> <td>New money (AME)</td> <td>&pound;168.2 million</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".79WS.1/14"> <td>Forecast loan recovery</td> <td>&pound;520.8 million</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".79WS.1/15"> <td colspan="2">This was allocated as follows:</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".79WS.1/16"> <td>Loans</td> <td>&pound;560 million</td> </tr>

			<tr pid=".79WS.1/18"> <td>Contingency reserve</td> <td>&pound;l million</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/21">If the forecast for loan recoveries proves to be an underestimate, any additional recoveries can be allocated to districts during the year.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/22">The contingency reserve is held centrally and allocations made from it reimburse districts for expenditure resulting from a local accident or disaster (eg, flooding).</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/23">Since April 1997, the gross discretionary social fund budget has increased by &pound;221.5 million from &pound;467.5 million to &pound;689 million, an increase of more than 47 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/24">Since April 1997, the community care grant budget has increased by &pound;31 million from &pound;97 million to &pound;128 million, an increase of nearly 32 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/25">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be making a number of minor changes to the discretionary social fund, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-05">5 April 2004</phrase>. The changes to the fund are minor clarifications of guidance and directions, and, in the main, are consequential to legislative changes being made in respect of other social security benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".79WS.1/26">Details of the changes have been placed in the Library.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-03-29.81WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1179" speakername="Bill Rammell" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs" colnum="81WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040329/wmstext/40329m03.htm#40329m03.html_spmin1">
	<p pid=".81WS.2/1">On 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-16">16 March 2004</phrase> the Argentine naval Icebreaker, Almirante Irizar sailed through the Falklands outer conservation zone and the Falklands interim conservation zone. These are areas for which the Falkland Islands Government issues fishing licences. During the time that it was inside these zones, the Argentine vessel was challenging other vessels to identify themselves. While transit of the conservation zones is permissible, the policing of the zones by a foreign vessel contravenes the Falkland Islands exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/2">We asked the Argentine Government for an explanation of the vessel's actions. Their response was not satisfactory. We have therefore made a formal protest to the Argentine Government concerning the actions of the Almirante Irizar, underlining the need to ensure that this type of incident does not happen again. This note also reiterated that HMG has no doubts about UK sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.</p>
	<p pid=".81WS.2/3">I have spoken to Falkland Island councillors about this incident. I share their concerns and I have briefed them on our response. I assured them of our continued firm support.</p>
