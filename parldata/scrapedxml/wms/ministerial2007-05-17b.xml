	<p pid="b.43WS.2/1">The Government are today publishing a consultation document setting out proposals for the distribution of unclaimed assets within the UK. This second unclaimed assets consultation document&mdash;&quot;Unclaimed Assets Distribution Mechanism: A Consultation&quot;&mdash;follows on from the previous document published in March this year<sup>(1)</sup> and provides further detail on how unclaimed assets will be reinvested in the community, with a focus, in England, on funding for youth services and financial capability and inclusion. The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will determine their own priorities for distribution which reflect the needs of communities in each country.</p>
	<p pid="b.43WS.2/2">The consultation document proposes using the Big Lottery Fund (BIG) as the main UK-wide unclaimed assets distribution body. BIG has a UK-wide distribution infrastructure in place, capacity to handle assets on this scale, extensive experience of delivering community programmes&mdash;with emphasis on young people, and the know-how on distributing funding through a different range of organisations, particularly from the third sector. Using BIG, an existing organisation, to distribute these assets will also help to limit spending on administration costs, meaning that more money reaches the front line.</p>
	<p pid="b.43WS.2/3">The Government also want to use a proportion of unclaimed assets to help develop the social investment market and invest in the long-term sustainability of the third sector, and will look at another delivery option to channel funds into this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.43WS.2/4">Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.43WS.5/1">The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedule 2 to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 require the Secretary of State to set and meet a timetable for the majority of planning cases which are to be decided by her (as opposed to being decided by a Planning Inspector) where the inquiry closed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>; and to make a report to Parliament each year on performance. This is intended both to ensure that such cases are dealt with expeditiously and to enable the parties to any particular case to know when they can expect to receive a decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.43WS.5/2">The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has accordingly today laid before Parliament an Act Paper reporting on all decisions where the inquiry, hearing or site visit ended on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and the decision was made between <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>. Some 199 of the 200 decisions&mdash;99.5 per cent.&mdash;made by the Secretary of State during this period on cases other than appeals under tree preservation orders were made within their statutory timetables, as were 694 out of 702 decisions&mdash;98.9 per cent.&mdash;on tree preservation order appeals.</p>
	<p pid="b.43WS.5/3">These provisions relate to decisions on called-in planning applications; planning appeals recovered for the Secretary of State's decision; other cases linked to such decisions, including listed building consent, conservation area consent, advertisement consent and enforcement notice appeals; and tree preservation order appeals. They do not apply to cases decided by Inspectors or to those decided by the Secretary of State jointly with a Minister of another Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.44WS.2/1">The Chancellor announced in his 2006 Budget the creation of a new charitable fund to support British citizens injured in or affected by terrorist attacks abroad. The British Red Cross Relief Fund for UK Victims of Terrorism Abroad is formally launched today.</p>
	<p pid="b.44WS.2/2">The &pound;1 million contribution to the fund announced by the Chancellor will be used by the Red Cross to administer two separate schemes. &pound;900,000 will establish an ongoing fund that will offer immediate small scale payments to UK victims bereaved or injured in terrorist attacks overseas. Payments will be made in two phases using a simple application process. Phase 1 payments of &pound;3,000 will be paid immediately. Phase 2 payments of &pound;12,000 will be available on application, to those severely injured or bereaved. Twenty-one interim payments of &pound;3,000 have already been made since March 2006; all those who have received interim payments will also be eligible to apply for second phase payments of &pound;12,000. The Red Cross hopes to be able to raise more money for the fund on the back of this initial Government donation.</p>
	<p pid="b.44WS.2/3">The other &pound;100,000 will be made available to the small number of households affected by terrorist attacks abroad prior to the fund's announcement last March, who are still suffering severe financial hardship as a result of what has happened to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.44WS.2/4">The Government have worked closely with victims groups and the voluntary sector in drawing up the details of this fund, to ensure that all those who are tragically affected by overseas terrorist attacks will receive assistance which is sensitive and appropriate to their needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.45WS.12/1">In May 2006, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced details of an independent review of palliative care services for children and young people with life-limiting or life-threatening illnesses and their families. This review offers an important opportunity to look at current provision and consider what more can be done to improve the sustainability and accessibility of services in both the statutory and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.12/2">I welcome the thorough review that has been conducted by Professor Sir Alan Craft and Sue Killen and thank them for their efforts. Their report comes at an important point in the evolution of children's services and it is critical that children and their families have confidence in the valuable support that palliative care services currently provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.12/3">I also recognise and pay tribute to the pioneering work carried out over the years by the voluntary sector and by hugely committed doctors, nurses and other care workers that has got us to this point. Together they have raised the profile of children's palliative care and this has resulted in a model of care which enables the children and families who use those services to live in dignity and comfort.</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.12/4">The independent reviewers have made various recommendations to improve and develop palliative care services and the commissioning and planning systems in which they operate. In the longer-term, they recommend that palliative care should become a sub-specialty in its own right and be a properly funded service.</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.12/5">Some of the recommendations are contingent on the comprehensive spending review, the results of which will not be known for some months, while others are for consideration by the voluntary sector, the royal colleges, regulators and other Government Departments such as the Department for Education and Skills. We are committed to working with these key partners to achieve real and lasting change.</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.12/6">The Government will consider carefully the recommendations and their implications for life-limited children and young people and for the health and social care system across the country. A detailed Government response will be formed alongside plans to take forward any recommendations coming out of HM Treasury and the Department for Education and Skills review of disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.12/7">In the meantime, I am setting up a delivery group of key stakeholders to co-ordinate delivery on those recommendations that can be taken forward immediately, including the development of a national strategy for children's palliative care. I very much hope those invited will accept the offer to work with the Government to help achieve the step-change we all desire.</p>
	<p pid="b.45WS.12/8">The report has been placed in the Library and copies are available to hon. Members from the Vote Office.</p>

	<p pid="b.46WS.2/2">The trials will improve our understanding of the movement of air-borne material in the urban environment, and will enable enhancements in public protection to be developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.2/3">The work is part of the Home Office's commitment to improve security and counter-terrorism. It will improve the UK's ability to deal with the consequences of a CBRN release through an increased knowledge of the dispersion of material in the urban environment. This knowledge will assist in planning for CBRN response and in public and emergency responder safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.46WS.2/4">The trials will involve the release of small amounts of non-toxic, odourless gases in the Marylebone area of Westminster starting from <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-20">20 May 2007</phrase>. The trials will run for a four to six-week period during which time information leaflets will be available to the public.
