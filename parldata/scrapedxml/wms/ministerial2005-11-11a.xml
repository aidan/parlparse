	<p pid="a.33WS.2/1">The new simplified regime for the taxation of pensions begins on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2006</phrase>. I can today announce that registered pension schemes will be permitted to submit reports and returns in paper form for at least six months before the requirement to submit information online becomes mandatory.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/2">HMRC's Pension Schemes Online service will become available over a number of releases throughout 2006&ndash;07. Pension Scheme administrators and practitioners will be able to meet most of their statutory filing requirements online at the time that they are required, but paper returns and reporting will also be offered as a supplementary means of filing for a limited period.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/3">HMRC will continue to work closely with the industry over the forthcoming months to support the implementation of the new regime. HMRC will be holding discussions with the pensions industry and software suppliers to establish what issues this delay may present and how best to address them, before moving to a mandatory online filing regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.2/4">This delay will not affect HMRC's ability to deliver Pensions Tax Simplification on 6th April 2006. The vast majority of pension schemes and their members will also not be affected by this delay. The new pensions regime heralds greater opportunities for 15 million pension savers to save more into a pension scheme and enjoy the associated flexibilities around contributions and the taking of retirement benefits.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-11a.33WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" speakername="Elliot Morley" speakeroffice="The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment" colnum="33WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051111/wmstext/51111m01.htm#51111m01.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/1">I am pleased to report to the House that the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has agreed a revised Statement of Principles on flood insurance taking into account commitments made by the Government on our programme to manage flood risk. It updates the existing Statement introduced in January 2003. The revised Statement, which is attached, will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2006</phrase>, and reflects the continued partnership between the industry and the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/2">In relation to the commitments made under the Statement of Principles, Government have significantly increased investment in flood management since 1997 and is committed to levels of spend of &pound;570 million a year throughout the 2004 spending period to 2007&ndash;08. This is over &pound;250 million a year more than in 1997. The Environment Agency is committed to delivering a programme of efficiencies that will be re-invested in flood management so as to maintain outputs in real terms. We are on target to deliver increased protection to over 80,000 houses since April 2003 and Operating Authorities have a forward programme of works which is planned to deliver the reduction in risk agreed with the ABI.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/3">The Environment Agency has published on their internet site an interactive flood map for England and Wales which shows the areas of land that could be at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea. The Agency is continually working to improve and update the information on flood defences and its flood mapping, and is committed to sharing this with all stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/4">Water and sewerage company plans to reduce public sewer flooding problems formed an important part of OfWat's price review for the period 2005&ndash;10. Over the next five years, almost &pound;1 billion will be invested in the public sewer network to reduce significantly the risk of properties being flooded by sewage.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/5">The Government have published its first response to the 'Making space for water' consultation including commitments to review and strengthen the planning process in flood risk locations, initiate pilot projects to develop integrated drainage partnerships in urban areas, encourage the uptake of property level resilience measures and to give the Environment Agency a strategic overview role for all types of flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/6">ABI UPDATED STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/7" class="italic">General policy</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/8" class="indent">It is the intention of ABI members that flood insurance for existing domestic properties and small businesses should continue to be available for as many customers as possible. The premiums charged and other terms&mdash;such as excesses&mdash;will reflect the risk of flooding but will be offered in a competitive market. There is separate ABI guidance on flood risk and new development.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/9" class="indent">This revised Statement of Principles will apply from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2006</phrase> but is subject to review in the event of significant external shocks such as withdrawal of flood reinsurance. Successfuloperation of the Statement is dependent on action by the Government to manage flood risk effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/10" class="italic">Current position</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/11" class="indent">The majority of the 2.2 million properties in flood risk areas are already protected to a minimum standard of 1.3 per cent. annual probability (one in 75 years) or better. However, around 15 per cent. of properties in the floodplain have a significant chance of flooding (greater than 1.3 per cent. annual probability). In some of these areas there are planned improvements to flood defences to reduce the risk, but there are other areas where there are no plans for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/12" class="indent">Despite these risks, insurers have continued to provide flood cover for the vast majority of customers in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/13" class="italic">Insurers' renewed commitment</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/14">Areas where flood risk is 1.3 per cent. annual probability (or one in 75 years) or less:</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/15" class="indent">Flood cover will be available as a standard feature of household and small business policies. The level to which properties are defended above this standard will vary considerably and premiums will reflect different degrees of risk. Highly populated coastal areas, in particular, should be protected to a higher standard because of the potential consequences should a flood occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/16">Areas of significant flood risk (greater than 1.3 per cent. annual probability or one in 75 years) where improved defences are planned:</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/17" class="indent">Insurers will maintain flood cover for domestic properties and small businesses that they already insure where improvements in flood protection schemes sufficient to reduce the likelihood of flooding to 1.3 per cent. annual probability or less are scheduled for completion within the next five years. This will operate as a rolling five-year commitment provided the Statement of Principles remains in force. Delays or disruptions could take a scheme beyond the five-year commitment. The premiums charged and other policy terms&mdash;such as excesses&mdash;will reflect the risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/18" class="indent">If a domestic property in this category is sold the current insurer will continue to provide cover, subject to satisfactory information about the new owners of the property, especially their previous claims record. Where a small business is sold the current insurer will consider whether to continue to provide cover; this will depend heavily on the proposed new use of the premises and the previous claims record of the new owner.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/19">Areas of significant flood risk (greater than 1.3 per cent. annual probability or one in 75 years) where no improvements in defences are planned:</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/20" class="indent">In these areas, insurers cannot guarantee to maintain cover, but will examine the risks on a case-by-case basis. Insurers will use their best efforts to continue to provide cover and will work with the owners of domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure to see what action could be taken by the property owner, the Environment Agency and the local authority to make the property insurable in some form. This action might include the use of accredited products, flood resilient materials and temporary defences to defend the property.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/21" class="italic">Action from Government</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/22">Continued operation of this Statement will depend on Government progress on the five key actions set out below, with an annual review of progress against specific performance targets, and a more comprehensive assessment after three years:</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/23" class="indent">Reducing the annual probability of flooding each year for a substantial number of properties in the UK, a proportion of which currently have a significant chance of flooding (greater than 1.3 per cent. annual probability).</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/24" class="indent">At least maintaining investment in flood management each year, so that outputs can be sustained in real terms, with a commitment to evidence-based discussions on future funding needs, taking account of climate change and other factors affecting risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/25" class="indent">Implementing reforms to the land-use planning system to ensure that new developments do not lead to an increase in national or local flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/26" class="indent">Communicating flood risk effectively, including providing higher quality and more detailed information on flood risk, and on existing, new and upcoming flood protection schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.33WS.5/27" class="indent">Developing an integrated approach to urban drainage that alleviates the risks of sewer flooding and flash-flooding.</p>

	<p pid="a.36WS.2/1">A General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) was held on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November</phrase> in Brussels. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr. Jack Straw) and I chaired the Council as Presidency. I also represented the UK on certain agenda items.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/2">The agenda items were covered as follows:</p>

The Presidency concluded that work on these areas should continue and that it would return to the issue at the 21/<phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase> GAERC.</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/9" class="italic">Belarus</p>
	<p pid="a.36WS.2/10" class="indent">The Presidency introduced the item noting the deteriorating situation on human rights and political freedoms in Belarus. High Representative Solana underlined the difficulty faced by the EU in trying to bring about reform. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner agreed noting their efforts to realign aid towards support for civil society. A large number of delegations spoke expressing concern at the deteriorating situation and highlighting the need to intensify contact and support to civil society. The Council also noted the importance of free and fair Presidential elections in 2006 and called for the Belarusian Government to issue an early invitation to an OSCE/ODIHR monitoring mission. The Council expressed willingness to take appropriate restrictive measures against responsible individuals in the event of a failure to uphold international standards.

Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and High Representative Solana highlighted that an EU role in this area would help build confidence. In discussion Member States supported the idea of EU involvement in a non-executive monitoring role. This was the fruit of a continuous effort on the ground, which would reinforce the EU's political role.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-11a.38WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="38WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051111/wmstext/51111m02.htm#51111m02.html_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/1">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's (HMIC) report, &quot;Closing the Gap&quot;, published in September 2005 concluded that the current 43 force structure in England and Wales was no longer &quot;fit for purpose&quot;. The report recommended that the best business solution was for the police service to reconfigure based on strategic forces of sufficient size to provide both effective neighbourhood policing and protective services to combat serious organised crime and terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/2">Following the publication of the HMIC report, the Home Secretary asked all police forces and authorities to consider the best options for their region and to submit them to him by <phrase class="date" code="">23 December 2005</phrase>. The first stage in this process was for police forces and police authorities to develop by the end of October short listed options for each region. This stage has now been completed and feedback has been provided to all chief officers and chairs of police authorities indicating which proposals appear to be most favourable for each of the nine Government Office regions in England and for Wales. The options identified for further development are set out below, although authorities are still free to develop alternative options alongside these.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/3">In recommending particular options, the arguments put forward by forces and authorities have been carefully considered along with the need to create a balanced and resilient policing landscape across the whole of England and Wales. Neighbourhood and Basic Command Unit (ECU) level policing remain the essential local face of the police service, and by ensuring greater resilience and capability in our police service we will help maintain this service, whilst at the same time strengthening the capacity to deal with serious and organised crimes, major incidents and counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/4">Forces and authorities are now being asked to complete a cost benefit analysis for all of their short listed options. They will then develop a business case and initial implementation plans for their recommended option to be submitted to the Home Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/5">The Secretary of State for Transport announced in a written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-11">11 October</phrase> that, in the context of this review, he would be reviewing separately the role of the British Transport Police (BTP) Proposals for the British Transport Police will be brought forward, if appropriate, once the outcome of that review is known.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/6">My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Ms Hazel Blears) has written to all Parliamentary colleagues on this matter inviting them to join the consultation process.</p>
