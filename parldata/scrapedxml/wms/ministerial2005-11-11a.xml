<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-11a.38WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="38WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051111/wmstext/51111m02.htm#51111m02.html_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/1">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's (HMIC) report, &quot;Closing the Gap&quot;, published in September 2005 concluded that the current 43 force structure in England and Wales was no longer &quot;fit for purpose&quot;. The report recommended that the best business solution was for the police service to reconfigure based on strategic forces of sufficient size to provide both effective neighbourhood policing and protective services to combat serious organised crime and terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/2">Following the publication of the HMIC report, the Home Secretary asked all police forces and authorities to consider the best options for their region and to submit them to him by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-23">23 December 2005</phrase>. The first stage in this process was for police forces and police authorities to develop by the end of October short listed options for each region. This stage has now been completed and feedback has been provided to all chief officers and chairs of police authorities indicating which proposals appear to be most favourable for each of the nine Government Office regions in England and for Wales. The options identified for further development are set out below, although authorities are still free to develop alternative options alongside these.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/3">In recommending particular options, the arguments put forward by forces and authorities have been carefully considered along with the need to create a balanced and resilient policing landscape across the whole of England and Wales. Neighbourhood and Basic Command Unit (ECU) level policing remain the essential local face of the police service, and by ensuring greater resilience and capability in our police service we will help maintain this service, whilst at the same time strengthening the capacity to deal with serious and organised crimes, major incidents and counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/4">Forces and authorities are now being asked to complete a cost benefit analysis for all of their short listed options. They will then develop a business case and initial implementation plans for their recommended option to be submitted to the Home Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/5">The Secretary of State for Transport announced in a written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-11">11 October</phrase> that, in the context of this review, he would be reviewing separately the role of the British Transport Police (BTP) Proposals for the British Transport Police will be brought forward, if appropriate, once the outcome of that review is known.</p>
	<p pid="a.38WS.2/6">My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Ms Hazel Blears) has written to all Parliamentary colleagues on this matter inviting them to join the consultation process.</p>
