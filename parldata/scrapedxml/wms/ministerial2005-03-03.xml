	<p>In parliamentary answers on dates 4 and 26 March 2003 and in letters to several hon. Members, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury explained changes that have been made to the rules governing the VAT treatment of state-regulated welfare agencies such as domiciliary care and independent fostering agencies. He explained that the changes would take effect from the date that the regulatory system and standards for welfare providers were implemented or, in the case of independent fostering agencies, on 1 April 2003. Following representations from a small number of businesses, Customs have issued a business brief clarifying the circumstances determining the time at which an agency becomes exempt. Copies are available in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p>On 14 February 2005, my noble Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement (Lord Bach) signed a statement of intent with the Secretary-General of the Iraqi Ministry of Defence which lays the foundation for co-operation on defence equipment matters in areas such as requirement definition, exchange of information, supplier identification, and the availability of commercial training.</p>
	<p>It is HMG's aim to assist the Iraqi Government and armed forces to rebuild their country and to improve security and stability. In support of this, a non-legally binding statement of intent will be mutually beneficial for both Governments.</p>
	<p>All such activities in connection with potential defence exports continue to adhere fully to national and international export control obligations.</p>

	<p>I am announcing today the publication of a consultation paper, entitled &quot;Planning Control of Mezzanine and other Internal Floorspace Additions&quot;, on draft provisions to be included in an amendment to the General Development Procedure Order 1995, and on the accompanying partial regulatory impact assessment.</p>
	<p>Section 49 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 inserts new sections 55(2A) and 55(2B) into the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. These new sections bring into the meaning of development operations which have the effect of increasing the internal gross floorspace of a building. This would make such increases in floor space subject to planning control.</p>
	<p>The Secretary of State by order can specify different circumstances under which this legislation would apply, and the draft order sets a threshold of 200m <sup>2</sup> and applies it to retail floorspace.</p>
	<p>It is not the Government's intention to halt mezzanine development. It is to bring under planning control any increases in internal floorspace above a specified level, so as to ensure the Government's objectives for town centres are not undermined by inappropriate development.</p>
	<p>The consultation will run until 26 May 2005. Copies of the consultation document will be made available in the Libraries of both Houses and from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p>The BBC documentary &quot;Detention Undercover: the Real Story&quot; screened last night contained allegations of racism and mistreatment of detainees at Oakington immigration reception centre and during removal.</p>
	<p>Oakington has a reputation for good staff-detainee relationships, and I regard it as in the interests of all at the centre to establish the truth of the allegations as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p>GSL, who manage and operate the centre at Oakington have mounted an internal investigation. I believe it appropriate to have a separate and independent investigation, which I have asked Stephen Shaw, the prisons and probation ombudsman, to undertake.</p>
	<p>The remit of the investigation is to:</p>
	<p class="indent">investigate allegations, made in the BBC programme &quot;Detention undercover: the real story&quot; broadcast on 2 March 2005, of racism and mistreatment by GSL staff of detainees at Oakington immigration reception centre and while under escort;</p>
	<p class="indent">in particular, to review the internal investigation already mounted by GSL, and the company's response to the allegations;</p>
	<p class="indent">to assess the implications for the management and oversight of Oakington and the escorting of detainees; and</p>
	<p class="indent">to make any necessary recommendations to the Government and GSL management.</p>
	<p>I am grateful to Stephen Shaw for agreeing to undertake this investigation. I hope the BBC will support this investigation by granting him full access to all the material gathered by the reporters.</p>
	<p>I have always made it clear that there is absolutely no place for racism anywhere in our society, and particularly within the immigration system. Detention and removal is an essential part of effective immigration controls, but it is vital that it is done with humanity and dignity, and I am committed to ensuring this is the case.</p>

	<p>The Government have received the first report from the chief inspector of criminal justice in Northern Ireland, Kit Chivers. The report is on &quot;The Management of Sex Offenders in Northern Ireland&quot; and has today been published.</p>
	<p>The Government warmly welcome this report which recognises the excellent work in this field being done by those agencies involved in public protection and identifies a number of areas for possible future development. I shall be considering very carefully the inspection's key recommendations. I have no doubt that the report will be of value in informing and reassuring the public about the steps already being taken to manage the risks posed by sex offenders in the community, and in helping managers and staff who are involved in this challenging area of work.</p>
