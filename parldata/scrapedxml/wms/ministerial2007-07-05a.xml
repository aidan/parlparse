<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-05a.49WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform" colnum="49WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070705/wmstext/70705m0001.htm#07070543000025">
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/1">The following statement provides information on the Competitiveness Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June</phrase> at which I represented the UK. Annette Schavan, German Federal Education and Research Minister, chaired the Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/2">The Council held an exchange of views and reached agreement on a general approach on the European Institute of Technology (EIT). The Council agreed that the number of Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) should be set at two or three to allow for flexibility and that the possibility of establishing KICs &quot;inter alia&quot; in renewable energy and climate change should be included in the preamble to the draft regulation establishing the EIT. On the budget, the Council agreed a sum of &euro;308.7 million for a six-year period beginning on <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2008</phrase>. The UK expressed its concerns over this figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/3">Council conclusions were adopted on a charter for the management of intellectual property rights and on the CREST report on co-ordination of the structural funds and the framework programme to support research and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/4">Ministers then had a short exchange of views on the European Research Area (ERA) Green Paper following up on discussions at the Wuerzburg Ministerial informal and the May Competitiveness Council, focusing on strengthening research institutions, knowledge sharing and international co-operation. The Council agreed that more effective knowledge transfer between universities, business and public research institutions was at the heart of improving Europe's capacity for innovation and some argued that any Commission proposals following the Green Paper would need to be informed by effective evaluation of sixth framework programme for research.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/5">Under AOB the Commission gave four presentations on the recently or soon to be adopted legislation to set up the Clean Sky and European Nanoelectronics Initiative Advisory Council (ENIAC) Joint Techonlogy Initiatives (JTIs) and the Ambient Assisted Living and EUROSTARS article 169 initiatives, stressing the need to get rapid agreement on the JTIs to maintain industry interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/6">The presidency gave a presentation on the Euro-Med Education and Research Ministers Conference, and an update on the proposal for a directive on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury.</p>
	<p pid="a.49WS.2/7">Also under AOB the Portuguese delegation set out their plans for their upcoming presidency.</p>
