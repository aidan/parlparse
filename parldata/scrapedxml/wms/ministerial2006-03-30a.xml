	<p pid="a.76WS.1/95"><sup>1</sup> Departments and Agencies which received 10 MPs/Peers letters or fewer during 2005 are not shown in this table. Holding or interim replies are not included unless otherwise indicated. This report includes letters from prospective candidates prior to the general election. The report does not include correspondence considered as Freedom of Information requests.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/96"><sup>2</sup> Received fewer than 10 letters in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/97"><sup>3</sup> With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue merged to form HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/98"><sup>4</sup> Includes a small number of letters from members of the public that received a ministerial reply. Figure also includes some FOI requests, though these represent less than 1 per cent of total reported.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/99"><sup>5</sup> Reduced volume of correspondence compared to previous years reflects the setting up of a central correspondence system and the introduction of a more accurate method of monitoring letters received.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/100"><sup>6</sup> Poor performance caused by backlog of cases and resource issues. Performance for December 2005 was 75 per cent, increased to 81 per cent in March 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.76WS.1/102"><sup>8</sup> IND saw an increase in volume of 15 per cent between 2004 and 2005 (6 per cent increase in ministerial, and 21 per cent in official replies). During 2005 all official replies were again signed off by IND senior executive group members which inevitably built delays into the system, but had the effect of significantly enhancing the quality of replies.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/103"><sup>9</sup> Performance slipped last year due to internal reorganisation following a reduction in staff numbers. Launch of new centralised response unit will raise level of performance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-30a.85WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="85WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060330/wmstext/60330m04.htm#60330m04.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/1">I am pleased to announce that, following consideration of the responses to public consultation, I have today laid before Parliament the Waste Management (England and Wales) regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 937), The Environment Act 1995 (Commencement No. 23) (England and Wales) Order 2006 (2006 No. (C. 934)) and a final regulatory impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/2">The effect of section 75(7)(c) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is to exclude waste from premises used for agriculture, and waste from mines and quarries, from the waste management controls that apply to &quot;controlled waste&quot;. The main purpose of the regulations is to repeal that exclusion and to apply to agricultural waste, and to non-mineral waste from mines and quarries, the national controls that are already in place to comply with the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended) and the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC).</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/3">The exclusion in section 75(7) (c) of the 1990 Act has been the subject of infraction proceedings on the Waste Framework Directive. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued an adverse judgment on this infraction on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase> (Case C-62/03) and a copy is available on the Court's website at <a href="http://curia.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/">http://curia.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/</a> form.pl?lang=en&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;docj= docj&amp;numaff=C-62%2F03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe= &amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100. The exclusion also applies to the legislation transposing the Landfill Directive in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/4">At present, most agricultural waste is disposed of on farm in &quot;farm dumps&quot; or by open burning. The regulations will ensure that agricultural waste is recovered or disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health. The controls will be enforced by the Environment Agency, as the &quot;competent authority&quot; in England and Wales, in ways which are proportionate to the risk to the environment and human health. The existing controls have applied to all other sectors of industry and types of waste since May 1994 in the case of the Waste Framework Directive; and since June 2002 in the case of the Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/5">The main consultation paper was sent to 495 organisations and a summary, with a pull-out questionnaire, was sent to 162,000 farmers and growers in England and Wales. There were 103 responses to the main consultation and 2,485 responses to the summary questionnaire. A consultation report has been prepared in compliance with the Cabinet Office &quot;Code of Practice on Consultation&quot; and is available on my Department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/topics/agwaste.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/topics/agwaste.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/6">The regulations come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">Monday 15 May 2006</phrase>. The Landfill Directive's requirements, section 33(1 )(c) of the 1990 Act and the duty of care under section 34 of the Act will apply from that date. However, the regulations contain transitional provisions which allow farmers six months from that date to register with the Environment Agency to transport agricultural waste on a professional basis or as a dealer or broker; and allow farmers 12 months to apply to the Agency for waste management licences, to dispose of or recover agricultural waste on-farm, or to register licensing exemptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/7">A wide range of licensing exemptions will be available to farmers. As a result of discussions with the Agricultural Waste Stakeholders' Forum and public consultation, we have identified proposals for more licensing exemptions for agricultural waste covering the use of drum incinerators, waste disposal in the event of a plant health disease outbreak, the use of ash from the incineration of non-SRM pig and poultry carcasses, the use of biobeds for pesticide residues and the use of dredgings from ditch clearances. We propose to carry out a supplementary consultation exercise on these proposals for more licensing exemptions during the 12-month transitional period before the regulations' waste management licensing provisions come fully into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/8">The regulations also contain related or consequential amendments to existing regulations. The main amendments are:</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/9" class="indent">To ensure continuing compliance with the Waste Framework Directive following the repeal of the Animal Waste Directive (90/667/EEC) and the introduction of the EU Animal By-Products Regulation ((EC) No. 1774/2002) which lays down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption. The proposed amendments apply to animal by-products which are waste within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive and are not excluded from the Directive's scope under Article 2;</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/10" class="indent">To repeal regulation 15 of the Waste Management Licensing regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994 No. 1056 (as amended)) and to amend the Groundwater regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998 No. 2746 (as amended)) to bring waste management licensing into line with other types of &quot;authorisations&quot; for the purposes of complying with the Groundwater Directive (80/68/EEC); and</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/11" class="indent">To address another aspect of the ECJ's adverse judgment on the Waste Framework Directive infraction by amending section 33(2) of the 1990 Act to provide that section 33(1) (c) applies to household waste from a domestic property; and so to prohibit the disposal etc. of such waste by private individuals, within the curtilage of the property, in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health. The prohibition already applies to any mineral or synthetic oil or grease, asbestos and clinical waste by virtue of regulation 3(1) of the Controlled Waste regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992 No. 588).</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-30a.92WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" speakername="Geoff Hoon" speakeroffice="The Leader of the House of Commons" colnum="92WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060330/wmstext/60330m06.htm#60330m06.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/1">The Parliamentary and Other Pensions Act 1987 requires the Government Actuary to make triennial reports on the financial position of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund. His latest report, dealing with the position of the Fund as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, is published today and a copy of the report &quot;Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund: Report by the Government Actuary on the Valuation as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> [HC 979]&quot; has been laid before the House. It includes his recommendation on the rate of Exchequer contributions to be made to the Fund, which the Act requires the Government to follow. The new rate of Exchequer contribution will be implemented in accordance with the requirements of the Act from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/2">The Government Actuary has assessed that the underlying cost of the benefits accruing under the Parliamentary pension scheme is lower than the cost assessed at the previous actuarial valuation in 2002 (27.4 per cent. of the total pensionable payroll of scheme members compared with 28 per cent.). This is primarily because the Government Actuary has assumed, in the light of recent experience, that MPs will leave and retire at higher ages than was assumed previously. Furthermore, the Exchequer share of the underlying cost has decreased due to higher contributions being paid by most of the scheme's members. The Government Actuary expects members' contributions to total 9.3 per cent.of the payroll, compared with 8.7 per cent. at the 2002 valuation. The Exchequer's share of the underlying cost has therefore fallen from 19.3 per cent. of payroll to 18.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/3">However, despite the fall in the underlying cost of accruing benefits and in the Exchequer share of that cost, the Government Actuary has recommended an increase in the level of Exchequer contributions to the Fund from the current level of 24 per cent. of payroll to a new level of 26.8 per cent. This is because there has been an increase in the deficit in the Fund (that is, a shortfall of assets to the estimated value of liabilities) since the Government Actuary's last valuation in 2002 from &pound;25.2 million to &pound;49.5 million. (For the purposes of the actuarial valuation, the value of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund's assets at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> was assessed as &pound;278.6 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/4">The deficit would have risen by around &pound;7 million even if the experience of the scheme had developed entirely in line with the assumptions made at the 2002 valuation&mdash;because of the interest that is assumed to accrue on the deficit, and because the increase in Exchequer contributions following the previous valuation only took effect a year after the valuation date. However, the deficit has increased further because the experience of the scheme has differed from what the Government Actuary assumed at the 2002 valuation, and also because the Government Actuary has changed his assumptions about what will happen in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/5">The main area where the experience of the scheme has differed from what the Government Actuary assumed is in relation to investment returns, which were lower than expected. In common with most other pension funds and other investors in equity shares, the Fund experienced negative investment returns in the first year covered by the Government Actuary's report and positive returns in the subsequent two years. Although the investment returns over the three years as a whole were positive, they were lower than had been assumed. Overall, divergence of the scheme's experience from the Government Actuary's assumptions made at the 2002 valuation contributed around &pound;5 million to the increased deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/6">The main area where the Government Actuary has changed his assumptions about what will happen in the future is in relation to the longevity of members. Again, in common with other pension funds, the Fund has been affected by the fact that people are living longer. The Government Actuary has assumed that the life expectancy of a 65-year old man has increased by two years to 19.5 years. Overall, changes in the Government Actuary's assumptions contributed around &pound;13 million to the increased deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/7">The contributions by the Exchequer to the Fund have fluctuated over the years, and the Exchequer has benefited in the past from the fact that the Fund has been in surplus and that lower contributions have been paid as a result. The level of Exchequer contributions over the period 1989 to 2003 varied between 4.4 per cent. and 9.6 per cent. of payroll, representing a saving of between 6.6 per cent. and 11 per cent. of payroll over the Exchequer's share of the underlying cost of the accruing benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/8">Separately from his report on the actuarial valuation, the Government Actuary has estimated that the capitalised value as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> of the saving to the Exchequer over the period 1989 to 2003 (that is, the difference between the actual level of the Exchequer contribution and the Exchequer share of the underlying cost of the accruing benefits) is &pound;50 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/9">The Government will be drawing the increased Exchequer contribution to the Fund to the attention of the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) when it next commissions the SSRB to make recommendations on the pension element of the Parliamentary remuneration package.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/10">The increase of 2.8 per cent in the Exchequer contribution may be broken down as follows:</p>
