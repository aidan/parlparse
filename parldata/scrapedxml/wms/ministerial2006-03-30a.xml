Holding or interim replies are not included unless otherwise indicated. This report includes letters from prospective candidates prior to the general election. The report does not include correspondence considered as Freedom of Information requests.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/96"><sup>2</sup> Received fewer than 10 letters in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/97"><sup>3</sup> With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue merged to form HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/98"><sup>4</sup> Includes a small number of letters from members of the public that received a ministerial reply. Figure also includes some FOI requests, though these represent less than 1 per cent of total reported.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/99"><sup>5</sup> Reduced volume of correspondence compared to previous years reflects the setting up of a central correspondence system and the introduction of a more accurate method of monitoring letters received.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/100"><sup>6</sup> Poor performance caused by backlog of cases and resource issues. Performance for December 2005 was 75 per cent, increased to 81 per cent in March 2006.</p>

During 2005 all official replies were again signed off by IND senior executive group members which inevitably built delays into the system, but had the effect of significantly enhancing the quality of replies.</p>
	<p pid="a.76WS.1/103"><sup>9</sup> Performance slipped last year due to internal reorganisation following a reduction in staff numbers. Launch of new centralised response unit will raise level of performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.84WS.1/1">My statement to the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March</phrase> re-affirmed our commitment to secure the continued affordability and viability of the Local Government Pension Scheme and to provide secure, equality-proofed pensions for its existing and future membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.1/2">A statutory instrument will be laid before Parliament today to remove the 85 year rule from the Scheme from <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase>, in order to comply with Council Directive 2000/78/EC. The regulations will also provide protection for existing scheme members who will be 60 and satisfy the 85-year rule by 2013 and will introduce significant and well supported flexibilities into the scheme's legal framework to reflect the simplified tax regime provided by the Finance Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.1/3">In the light of discussions held yesterday with the trades unions and local government employers, we are calling on both sides to begin talks, to start now on a nothing ruled in nothing ruled out basis, to address the protection of existing scheme members, the recycling of savings, and the development of a more equitable scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.1/4">The Government stand prepared to introduce further amendments before the summer recess to update the regulations in light of any agreed proposals which emerge from the talks between the trades unions and local government employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.84WS.1/5">The Government are committed to good quality pensions for local government workers without placing an unfair burden on taxpayers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-30a.85WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs" colnum="85WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060330/wmstext/60330m04.htm#60330m04.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/1">I am pleased to announce that, following consideration of the responses to public consultation, I have today laid before Parliament the Waste Management (England and Wales) regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 937), The Environment Act 1995 (Commencement No. 23) (England and Wales) Order 2006 (2006 No. (C. 934)) and a final regulatory impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/2">The effect of section 75(7)(c) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is to exclude waste from premises used for agriculture, and waste from mines and quarries, from the waste management controls that apply to &quot;controlled waste&quot;. The main purpose of the regulations is to repeal that exclusion and to apply to agricultural waste, and to non-mineral waste from mines and quarries, the national controls that are already in place to comply with the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended) and the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC).</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/3">The exclusion in section 75(7) (c) of the 1990 Act has been the subject of infraction proceedings on the Waste Framework Directive. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued an adverse judgment on this infraction on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase> (Case C-62/03) and a copy is available on the Court's website at <a href="http://curia.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/">http://curia.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/</a> form.pl?lang=en&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;docj= docj&amp;numaff=C-62%2F03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe= &amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100. The exclusion also applies to the legislation transposing the Landfill Directive in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/4">At present, most agricultural waste is disposed of on farm in &quot;farm dumps&quot; or by open burning. The regulations will ensure that agricultural waste is recovered or disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health. The controls will be enforced by the Environment Agency, as the &quot;competent authority&quot; in England and Wales, in ways which are proportionate to the risk to the environment and human health. The existing controls have applied to all other sectors of industry and types of waste since May 1994 in the case of the Waste Framework Directive; and since June 2002 in the case of the Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/5">The main consultation paper was sent to 495 organisations and a summary, with a pull-out questionnaire, was sent to 162,000 farmers and growers in England and Wales. There were 103 responses to the main consultation and 2,485 responses to the summary questionnaire. A consultation report has been prepared in compliance with the Cabinet Office &quot;Code of Practice on Consultation&quot; and is available on my Department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/topics/agwaste.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/topics/agwaste.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/6">The regulations come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 15 May 2006</phrase>. The Landfill Directive's requirements, section 33(1 )(c) of the 1990 Act and the duty of care under section 34 of the Act will apply from that date. However, the regulations contain transitional provisions which allow farmers six months from that date to register with the Environment Agency to transport agricultural waste on a professional basis or as a dealer or broker; and allow farmers 12 months to apply to the Agency for waste management licences, to dispose of or recover agricultural waste on-farm, or to register licensing exemptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/7">A wide range of licensing exemptions will be available to farmers. As a result of discussions with the Agricultural Waste Stakeholders' Forum and public consultation, we have identified proposals for more licensing exemptions for agricultural waste covering the use of drum incinerators, waste disposal in the event of a plant health disease outbreak, the use of ash from the incineration of non-SRM pig and poultry carcasses, the use of biobeds for pesticide residues and the use of dredgings from ditch clearances. We propose to carry out a supplementary consultation exercise on these proposals for more licensing exemptions during the 12-month transitional period before the regulations' waste management licensing provisions come fully into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/8">The regulations also contain related or consequential amendments to existing regulations. The main amendments are:</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/9" class="indent">To ensure continuing compliance with the Waste Framework Directive following the repeal of the Animal Waste Directive (90/667/EEC) and the introduction of the EU Animal By-Products Regulation ((EC) No. 1774/2002) which lays down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption. The proposed amendments apply to animal by-products which are waste within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive and are not excluded from the Directive's scope under Article 2;</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/10" class="indent">To repeal regulation 15 of the Waste Management Licensing regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994 No. 1056 (as amended)) and to amend the Groundwater regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998 No. 2746 (as amended)) to bring waste management licensing into line with other types of &quot;authorisations&quot; for the purposes of complying with the Groundwater Directive (80/68/EEC); and</p>
	<p pid="a.85WS.2/11" class="indent">To address another aspect of the ECJ's adverse judgment on the Waste Framework Directive infraction by amending section 33(2) of the 1990 Act to provide that section 33(1) (c) applies to household waste from a domestic property; and so to prohibit the disposal etc. of such waste by private individuals, within the curtilage of the property, in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health. The prohibition already applies to any mineral or synthetic oil or grease, asbestos and clinical waste by virtue of regulation 3(1) of the Controlled Waste regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992 No. 588).</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-30a.88WS.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" speakername="Patricia Hewitt" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health" colnum="88WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060330/wmstext/60330m05.htm#60330m05.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.88WS.5/1">I am responding on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to the Twenty-first Report of the Review Body for Nursing and Other Health Professions (NOHPRB) and the Thirty-fifth Report of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) which have been laid before Parliament today. Copies of the reports have been placed in the Library. I am grateful to the chairs and members of the Review Bodies for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid="a.88WS.5/2">The NOHPRB has recommended an increase in the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; pay rates of 2.5 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>. The NOHPRB has also recommended that the high cost area supplements should be increased by 2.5 per cent. The DDRB has recommended with effect from April 2006 general increases in remuneration of 2.2 per cent. for consultants and doctors and dentists in training, 2.4 per cent. for non-consultant career grade doctors and salaried dentists and an increase of 3.0 per cent. in gross remuneration for general dental practitioners. The DDRB has also recommended that the salary range for salaried general medical practitioners should be increased by 2.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.88WS.5/3">The NOHPRB's pay recommendations are being accepted in full and without staging.</p>
	<p pid="a.88WS.5/4">The DDRB's pay recommendations are being accepted. However, the award for consultants will be staged. Consultants have particularly benefited from pay reform with an average increase in earnings of 11.5 per cent. in the last two years. In considering the DDRB recommendations, it is necessary to consider a range of factors and with the National Health Service currently running a small deficit affordability must also be taken into account. Consultants will therefore receive a 1 per cent. increase from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase> increasing to 2.2 per cent. from <phrase class="date" code="">1 November 2006</phrase>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-30a.91WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department" colnum="91WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060330/wmstext/60330m06.htm#60330m06.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/1">The Fifth Report of the Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) on the pay of in-charge governors and operational managers, prison officers and related grades in England and Wales in 2006 has been published today and copies will be placed in the Library. I would like to thank the Chair and members of the PSPRB for their hard work in producing their recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/2">The PSPRB have recommended an increase in basic pay for all grades of &pound;425 or 1.6 per cent., whichever is the greater. The recommendation will lead to a growth in the pay bill of 2.57 per cent. to &pound;849 million (excluding oncosts), which is at the upper limit of affordability.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/3">The Home Secretary has decided that the recommendations will be implemented in full, with effect from the operative date of the award of <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>. The cost of the award will be met from within the existing budget allocation for the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/4">The Government desire significant improvement in the Prison Service pay and grading structure. It is asking the trade unions to be fully engaged in talks and to commit to:</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/5">1. Participation in the development of the Service wide job evaluation system, initially through positive engagement with the eastern area pilot, which has already commenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/6">2. Work in partnership with Prison Service management and take forward the principles covered in last year's heads of agreement talks.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/7">3. Immediately reengage with the performance improvement process.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/8">4. Reform the Whitley council arrangements with a view to establishing long-term partnership agreements based upon single table talks and compliance with the information and consultation of employees directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/9">The Home Secretary expects the trade unions to engage with the Prison Service in talks towards workforce reform based on these principles. The outcome of those talks are likely to inform his remit to the Pay Review Body in respect of next year's pay review.</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/10">The key Pay Review Body recommendations, which take effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>, are:</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/11" class="indent">An increase in basic pay for all grades of &pound;425 or 1.6 per cent., whichever is the greater;</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/12" class="indent">Pay range minima for operational managers to be increased by six spine points, with no change to the range maxima;</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/13" class="indent">Two additional rates of locality pay at &pound;4,250 and &pound;250. All other rates remain unchanged;</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/14" class="indent">All specialist allowances to remain at their current level;</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/15" class="indent">All other allowances and ex gratia payments to be uprated by 1.6 per cent.;</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/16" class="indent">RHA for operational managers to be uprated by 1.6 per cent.;</p>
	<p pid="a.91WS.1/17" class="indent">Care and maintenance of dogs allowance to be uprated by 3.2 per cent.;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-30a.92WS.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" speakername="Geoff Hoon" speakeroffice="The Leader of the House of Commons" colnum="92WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060330/wmstext/60330m06.htm#60330m06.html_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/1">The Parliamentary and Other Pensions Act 1987 requires the Government Actuary to make triennial reports on the financial position of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund. His latest report, dealing with the position of the Fund as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, is published today and a copy of the report &quot;Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund: Report by the Government Actuary on the Valuation as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> [HC 979]&quot; has been laid before the House. It includes his recommendation on the rate of Exchequer contributions to be made to the Fund, which the Act requires the Government to follow. The new rate of Exchequer contribution will be implemented in accordance with the requirements of the Act from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/2">The Government Actuary has assessed that the underlying cost of the benefits accruing under the Parliamentary pension scheme is lower than the cost assessed at the previous actuarial valuation in 2002 (27.4 per cent. of the total pensionable payroll of scheme members compared with 28 per cent.). This is primarily because the Government Actuary has assumed, in the light of recent experience, that MPs will leave and retire at higher ages than was assumed previously. Furthermore, the Exchequer share of the underlying cost has decreased due to higher contributions being paid by most of the scheme's members. The Government Actuary expects members' contributions to total 9.3 per cent.of the payroll, compared with 8.7 per cent. at the 2002 valuation. The Exchequer's share of the underlying cost has therefore fallen from 19.3 per cent. of payroll to 18.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/3">However, despite the fall in the underlying cost of accruing benefits and in the Exchequer share of that cost, the Government Actuary has recommended an increase in the level of Exchequer contributions to the Fund from the current level of 24 per cent. of payroll to a new level of 26.8 per cent. This is because there has been an increase in the deficit in the Fund (that is, a shortfall of assets to the estimated value of liabilities) since the Government Actuary's last valuation in 2002 from &pound;25.2 million to &pound;49.5 million. (For the purposes of the actuarial valuation, the value of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund's assets at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> was assessed as &pound;278.6 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/4">The deficit would have risen by around &pound;7 million even if the experience of the scheme had developed entirely in line with the assumptions made at the 2002 valuation&mdash;because of the interest that is assumed to accrue on the deficit, and because the increase in Exchequer contributions following the previous valuation only took effect a year after the valuation date. However, the deficit has increased further because the experience of the scheme has differed from what the Government Actuary assumed at the 2002 valuation, and also because the Government Actuary has changed his assumptions about what will happen in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/5">The main area where the experience of the scheme has differed from what the Government Actuary assumed is in relation to investment returns, which were lower than expected. In common with most other pension funds and other investors in equity shares, the Fund experienced negative investment returns in the first year covered by the Government Actuary's report and positive returns in the subsequent two years. Although the investment returns over the three years as a whole were positive, they were lower than had been assumed. Overall, divergence of the scheme's experience from the Government Actuary's assumptions made at the 2002 valuation contributed around &pound;5 million to the increased deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/6">The main area where the Government Actuary has changed his assumptions about what will happen in the future is in relation to the longevity of members. Again, in common with other pension funds, the Fund has been affected by the fact that people are living longer. The Government Actuary has assumed that the life expectancy of a 65-year old man has increased by two years to 19.5 years. Overall, changes in the Government Actuary's assumptions contributed around &pound;13 million to the increased deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/7">The contributions by the Exchequer to the Fund have fluctuated over the years, and the Exchequer has benefited in the past from the fact that the Fund has been in surplus and that lower contributions have been paid as a result. The level of Exchequer contributions over the period 1989 to 2003 varied between 4.4 per cent. and 9.6 per cent. of payroll, representing a saving of between 6.6 per cent. and 11 per cent. of payroll over the Exchequer's share of the underlying cost of the accruing benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/8">Separately from his report on the actuarial valuation, the Government Actuary has estimated that the capitalised value as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> of the saving to the Exchequer over the period 1989 to 2003 (that is, the difference between the actual level of the Exchequer contribution and the Exchequer share of the underlying cost of the accruing benefits) is &pound;50 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/9">The Government will be drawing the increased Exchequer contribution to the Fund to the attention of the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) when it next commissions the SSRB to make recommendations on the pension element of the Parliamentary remuneration package.</p>
	<p pid="a.92WS.2/10">The increase of 2.8 per cent in the Exchequer contribution may be broken down as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.96WS.1/22">The Government have decided in the light of what is affordable within expenditure plans and the specific circumstances relating to the senior civil service that the increase in paybill proposed by the Review Body should be implemented in two stages. 1 per cent. will be implemented with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>, and the remainder with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 November 2006</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.96WS.1/29">The Government have decided in the light of what is affordable within expenditure plans and the specific circumstances relating to the judiciary that the increases proposed by the Review Body should be paid in two stages.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-30a.103WS.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Transport" colnum="103WS"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060330/wmstext/60330m10.htm#60330m10.html_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/1">I attended the Transport Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/2">The Council's main item was a debate on the draft Public Service Obligation (PSO) regulation which would provide new rules for public funding of rail and road passenger transport services. The discussion focused on the extent of permissible exemptions from competitive tendering, measures to prevent distortion of competition and the status of contracts concluded before any new regulation comes into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/3">Most member states could accept the possibility of contracts for long-distance, regional and suburban rail services being directly awarded without competition. But, the majority could not accept that authorities should also be free to award bus and light rail contracts directly to an operator of their choice. I stated that the UK opposed any extension of the power directly to award contracts beyond the long-distance and regional rail markets, which the Council had accepted in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/4">On behalf of the UK I argued for additional measures to be put in place to prevent distortions of competition by operators in receipt of directly awarded contracts. The UK received limited support for such measures, with most member states believing the Commission's proposal contained sufficient safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/5">Most member states favoured the continuation of existing contracts until their expiry date, particularly if the contracts had been awarded on a competitive basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/6">In conclusion, the Austrian presidency invited Coreper to resume its detailed examination of the proposal with a view to bringing a text to the Council for agreement in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/7">The Council also held a discussion on road safety. The Commissioner stressed the value of recently agreed road safety legislation, but noted that further work was necessary. The Commission will therefore shortly come forward with new proposals to meet the objectives of the road safety action plan. The proposals will include minimum safety standards for new roads on the trans-European network, improved cross-border recognition of the most frequent breaches of road safety law, a requirement for retrofitting dead-angle mirrors, and a requirement for the fitting and use of day-time running lights. The UK has concerns about some of these measures and we will need to consider them very carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/8">The Council also heard the Commissioner's presentation on the communication on the promotion of inland waterway transport (&quot;NAIADES&quot;). The proposal includes a number of strands to revitalise Inland Waterway transport in order to reduce traffic congestion and harmful effects on the environment. The Austrian presidency indicated they want to agree Council conclusions on this proposal in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/9">The Council reached a general approach on aviation security. The proposal, if political agreement is achieved, will update the existing Regulation 2320/02. The new proposal would help to clarify, simplify, and further harmonise legal requirements with the aim of enhancing overall security in civil aviation. The Council also took note that the Commission would complete its study on financing of security by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/10">The Council heard the Commissioner's progress report on the SESAR proposal, the project for implementation of the Single European Sky (air traffic management). The Commissioner explained that the proposal would establish a Joint Undertaking to manage the development of a new air traffic management system, which would improve air safety and reduce the environmental impact of aviation. The project would be supported by the European Community, Eurocontrol and industry, and also possibly third countries in the future. The Austrian presidency hopes to reach a general approach at the June Transport Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/11">The Council received a progress report from the Commissioner on the air transport negotiations between the EU and the US. He reported that the US Government aims to finalise its rule on airline control by the end of April. In the Commissioner's view, and provided the US proposals were acceptable, this timeframe could allow Ministerial approval at the June Transport Council and a signature at the EU-US summit on <phrase class="date" code="">21 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/12">The Council was able to agree conclusions and to grant the Commission a mandate to take forward negotiations with Russia regarding Siberian overflight payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/13">The Commissioner gave a progress report on the Galileo satellite navigation project. The second round of negotiations with the consortium bidding for the PPP concession have begun, and the contract is expected to conclude by the end of the year. The most difficult issues so far were: risk sharing between the public and the private sectors; and design risk. The Commissioner will provide a further update on development at the June Transport Council and would inform member states on the outcome of the negotiations as soon as they were known. The presidency noted that it would be important to provide information to member states in sufficient time to allow them to make an assessment of the outcome of the negotiations before the contract was signed.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/14">The presidency noted that member states had responded in writing to the three questions on the EU strategy for sustainable development proposed by a Friends of the Presidency group to inform debate at the next European Council. The Austrian presidency will produce a summary.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/15">The Council achieved a political agreement without debate on the draft recast directive on driving licences. I abstained on behalf of the UK. While, the Government support much of the text; the Government were concerned about the provisions on motorcycle staging. The Government considered that the system for motorcycle staging will create significant difficulty for our motorcyclists, with no tangible benefit for road safety in the UK. The Government tabled a minutes statement making our objections clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/16">Without debate, the Council accepted the European Parliament's 2nd Reading amendments to its common position on the Eurovignette directive, which will establish new Community rules for the charging of heavy goods vehicles. This agreement between the Council and Parliament was facilitated during the UK presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/17">There were a number of additional AOB points of which the most significant were:</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/18">The Commission reported on supply chain security and noted that there was already legislation on airports, port facilities and on the ports themselves. This proposal served as a way of linkage to increase security of the supply chain. The proposal would be a voluntary system to provide a quality label of &quot;safe operators&quot; showing that they complied with minimum standards. The Commission said that the benefit for safe operators would be reduced checks and paperwork which could give them a competitive advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/19">The Commission presented its proposed directive on promotion of clean road vehicles. The Environment Council will be taking forward this proposal for which 25 per cent. of publicly procured vehicles over 3.5 tonnes will be required meet enhanced environmentally friendly vehicle standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/20">The Commission informed the Council that it had withdrawn the proposal on access to port services. The forthcoming Commission review of the EU Transport Policy White Paper would include a chapter on ports focusing on transparent financing of port operations and the application of competition rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.103WS.1/21">During lunch there was a discussion of the Commission's mid-term review of the EU Transport Policy White Paper. There was a consensus that the proposed shift away from focusing on modal shift to an approach that makes the best use of each mode was a sensible approach. There was also a discussion on the response of the transport sector to a possible future (human) flu pandemic, during which there was an agreement to share best practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.110WS.1/3">The Department has worked closely with the safety camera partnerships to help them to develop operational cases for 2006&ndash;07, which will ensure that all camera activities continue to contribute to reducing speeds and casualties and assist in the achievement of the 2010 casualty reduction targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.110WS.1/4">All activities and camera sites will comply with the &quot;Handbook of Rules and Guidance for the Safety Camera Programme in England and Wales for 2006&ndash;07&quot; which we published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.111WS.6/1">I am pleased to announce changes to the discretionary loans scheme from <phrase class="date" code="">3 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.111WS.6/2">We have greatly simplified the rules for determining the size of the maximum budgeting loan amount that can be offered to eligible applicants. There are now only three rates that can be offered: one for single people; one for couples without children; one for families with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.111WS.6/3">The complex &quot;double debt&quot; rule is abolished so that those applicants with existing budgeting loan debt have more help available to them. This, and the simpler rules for determining size of the maximum budgeting loan, means that applicants will understand better the help that is available and when they can access it.</p>
	<p pid="a.111WS.6/4">We have increased the overall limit on loan amounts that any applicant can borrow from the social fund. At the same time we are reducing the highest loan repayment rates and giving applicants longer to repay their loan debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.111WS.6/5">Also from <phrase class="date" code="">3 April 2006</phrase>, budgeting loan applicants will benefit from being able to have more savings before any budgeting loan award is affected. The capital limit is doubled to &pound;1,000 (under pension age) and &pound;2,000 (pension age).</p>
	<p pid="a.111WS.6/6">Overall this is a significant package of changes. Also, in making loans more affordable and easier to access, we aim to help people avoid alternative high cost lenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.116WS.1/1">I am pleased to announce that the gross discretionary social fund budget for 2006&ndash;07 will be &pound;842 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/2">This includes an increase in net treasury funding of &pound;120 million. The increase is the first of three annual increases which in total comprise a substantial &pound;210 million boost to support changes to the discretionary loans scheme announced in pre-Budget reports of 2004 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/3">With the investment of the extra net funding of &pound;120 million, I have been able to allocate a gross national loans budget of &pound;700 million from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/4">I have also decided to increase the national community care grant budget by &pound;3 million to &pound;141 million. This is the seventh consecutive annual increase and means that the national community care grant budget is now almost 44 per cent. higher than in 1999&ndash;2000. &pound;1 million will be retained centrally as a contingency reserve. For example to provide additional help to districts facing unexpected and unplanned expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="a.116WS.1/6">The discretionary social fund budget is cash limited. Budgets are allocated to districts on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/7">The gross discretionary SF budget allocated for 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;842 million made up of:</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/8" class="indent">New money (AME) &pound;298.2 million</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/9" class="indent">Forecast loan recovery &pound;543.8 million</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/10" class="indent">This was allocated as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/11" class="indent">Loans &pound;700 million</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/12" class="indent">Grants &pound;141 million</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/13" class="indent">Contingency reserve &pound;1 million</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/14">If the forecast for loan recoveries proves to be an underestimate, any additional recoveries can be allocated to districts during the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.116WS.1/15">The contingency reserve is held centrally and allocations made from it reimburse districts for expenditure resulting from a local accident or disaster&mdash; for example, floods.</p>
