<p>I have received notification from the Minister for Regional Development that he wishes to make a statement on a matter that fulfils the criteria set out in Standing Order 24. I will call the Minister to speak for up to three minutes on the subject. I will then call a representative from each of the other political parties to speak, as agreed with the Whips. Those Members will also have up to three minutes to speak on the matter. As Members will know, the convention is that there will be no opportunity for interventions, questions or a vote on the matter. I will not take any points of order until the item of business is completed. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I wish to update the Assembly on the Manx2 air crash last Thursday at Cork Airport. There has been a shared sense of tragedy and grief throughout the island, and I am sure that all in this Chamber will wish to join with me in relaying our condolences and sympathies to the families and friends of those killed and injured.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the Southern authorities have released the names of those who died and those who were injured in the crash. Those who died were the pilot, Jordi Sola Lopez from Barcelona; the co-pilot, Andrew John Cantle from Sunderland in England; Pat Cullinan from Plumbridge in Tyrone, who was a former pupil of my Assembly colleague Claire McGill, and I know she joins with me in offering her condolences to his family; Captain Michael Evans, deputy harbour master at Belfast harbour; Brendan McAleese from Kells in County Antrim; and Richard Kenneth Noble, originally from England but living in Jordanstown, County Antrim.</p>
<p>Four people were injured in the crash and are still in hospital: Peter Cowley from Glanmire in Cork, Mark Dickens from Watford in England, Heather Elliott from Belfast, and Brendan Mallon from Bangor, County Down. Their condition is reported as comfortable. Donal Walsh from Waterford and Lawrence Wilson from Larne, both of whom suffered minor injuries, have been discharged from hospital.</p>
<p>Last Friday afternoon, the deputy First Minister visited the injured in Cork University Hospital. I want to extend my sincere thanks to the doctors and staff at the hospital who are caring for the injured and to the emergency services that attended the crash scene, without whose prompt actions there could well have been more fatalities. I commend also the team from the PSNI and Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, which set up a unit at Belfast City Airport to provide assistance to the relatives and friends of the passengers. I visited Belfast City Airport on Thursday along with the First Minister and deputy First Minister, and I said then that my Department would offer whatever assistance it can to the Southern authorities to deal with the crash and with whatever arrangements are needed by the bereaved families and relatives of the injured.</p>
<p>My Department stands ready to help wherever it can over the coming weeks. I repeat my sincere condolences and sympathies and, I am sure, those of all Members to the families of the bereaved and the injured.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.1.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90281" speakername="Arlene Foster" url="">
<p>I pass on the condolences of the Democratic Unionist Party to all the people who have been bereaved. The greater number of those who were travelling on the flight to Cork that morning were businesspeople, and it is a flight that many businesspeople take there and back for their work. Of the six people who died, four were businesspeople, and the two others were the pilot and the co-pilot. We remember the pilot and the co-pilot and their families in England and Spain. I also wish to put on record my condolences and those of the party to the families of Brendan McAleese, who worked in Central Laundries in Cookstown; Pat Cullinan, who was a partner in KPMG in Belfast; Captain Michael Evans, the deputy harbour master at Belfast harbour; and Richard Noble, managing director of the Irish division of the Danwood Group printing business. Behind each businessperson, there is, of course, a family, whether that is a wife with young children or a grieving mother and her wider family. On behalf of my party, I sincerely give my condolences to each of the bereaved families, and, indeed, I wish the survivors a very speedy recovery.</p>
<p>The First Minister, my party leader, spoke to the Taoiseach last week and asked him to pass on good wishes to those who had survived and good wishes and thanks to the emergency services. As the Minister for Regional Development said, the emergency services had a great deal to do under very trying circumstances, and we acknowledge their work and commend them for their actions.</p>
<p>Last week, my party leader spoke of the fragility of life, and that is very true. All that we can do as public representatives is to sympathise with the bereaved, to support the injured and, importantly, in the weeks and months to come, to find out what actually happened on that flight to Cork last week.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.1.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90299" speakername="John McCallister" url="">
<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter and to associate myself and the Ulster Unionist Party with the comments of Minister Murphy and Minister Foster.</p>
<p>It was with great shock and sadness that we all learned of the events in Cork last week. On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, it is important that we record our sympathy with all the families and keep in our prayers and thoughts all the people who mourn at this time. As Mrs Foster mentioned, it shows us how fragile life can be and how quickly, like the families involved in this dreadful event in Cork, any of us can be thrown into tragedy. Of course, we keep the families in our thoughts and prayers and also those who survived and are still in hospital. We wish them a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>I place on record our gratitude to the emergency services, on the scene and at Cork University Hospital, for their excellent work and speedy response to the incident. Such an occasion will always be difficult to respond to. As Minister Murphy mentioned, the response up here from the PSNI and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust was important. In such a tragedy, it is important that we all work together to support families at a very difficult time. I hope that that support and the prayers will continue for the families who mourn and the families of the people who are recovering in hospital.</p>
<p>It is with great sadness that we stand here today to speak on this event. We hope that lessons are learned from the tragedy and that they can be built on to ensure that we lessen the chances of ever having to stand here again after such an event. We will keep the families in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.1.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90360" speakername="Conall McDevitt" url="">
<p>I join the Minister and colleagues in expressing the sincere sympathies of the SDLP to the families of Pat Cullinan, Brendan McAleese, Richard Noble and Captain Michael Evans. With your permission, Mr Speaker, it might be appropriate to express condolences in Spanish a la familia de Capit&aacute;n Jordi Sola Lopez y al pueblo de Manresa en Catalu&ntilde;a, que, hoy, como nosotros, sentiran el dolor de haber perdido un miembro de su poblaci&oacute;n.</p>
<p>Like us, the people of Manresa in Catalu&ntilde;a, near Barcelona, will be suffering from the great tragedy of this loss. The tragedy is compounded by the fact that, unusually, the flight originated on this island and ended on this island. Not too many flights do that. As the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment pointed out, those people left our city to do a day&rsquo;s work thinking that they would probably be back in Belfast in time for dinner, and for them never to return compounds the great tragedy that unfolded on Thursday at Cork Airport.</p>
<p>I also join colleagues in expressing our great thanks to the emergency services at Cork Airport. It seems that they behaved in an exemplary fashion. We should also remember Cork Airport&rsquo;s chaplains, from all denominations. By all accounts, they really stepped up to the mark in fulfilling a very difficult and challenging pastoral role as the great tragedy unfolded in front of their eyes. Nothing will bring back those who have been lost to our region, but it is undoubtedly necessary that a full investigation take place and that we understand the cause of and the truth behind what happened at Cork Airport on Thursday.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Alliance Party, I join my colleagues in extending sincere thoughts, prayers and condolences to all those people, and particularly the bereaved, who have been affected by the tragic accident in Cork, and we pray for the full recovery of all those who were injured. I join my colleagues in paying particular tribute to the response of all the emergency services. The speed of their response undoubtedly prevented further loss of life.</p>
<p>I spoke with representatives from Belfast City Airport on Thursday, and I send our encouragement and sympathy to all the staff at the airport who have been affected by this tragic accident. I join in extending our sympathy to the Lopez family in Spain, and, in particular, to the family of Brendan McAleese, as my father worked with him. I assure all the families who are dealing with this incomprehensible loss that they have the full support of the Assembly in dealing with their grief.</p>

<p>Before we come to the first item on the Order Paper, I want to address an ongoing issue in the Chamber. It concerns Members not turning up for Question Time when their names are down to ask a question. It gives me no pleasure to address this issue, but it has to be addressed. I have previously commented on the issue of Members not being in their places for Question Time, and there was a brief period of improvement. However, over the past two Tuesdays&rsquo; sittings, there were 10 occasions on which Members were not in the Chamber when their questions were called. Now, as far as I am concerned, that treats the entire House and its procedures with total and absolute contempt.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.2.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90355" speakername="Mr Speaker" time="12:15" url="">
<p>I have raised the issue with the Whips and the Business Committee several times. I am disappointed that the situation continues. I appreciate that times are busy for all of us. However, that is not an excuse. Surely, it is individual Members&rsquo; responsibility to check whether they are on the list to ask questions. I can understand that, in certain circumstances, Members may be unable to be in their places when they are called to ask questions. There is no reason why they cannot inform me in good time so that they can withdraw their questions and, at least, show the House the courtesy that it deserves.</p>
<p>What is happening? Some Members come to the Speaker&rsquo;s Office or the Business Office to say that they cannot be in the Chamber for whatever reason. We can all accept that. However, certain Members just do not turn up. In fact, the Clerk or whoever is in the Chair looks around the Chamber and, all of a sudden, realises that a Member is not in his or her place but has given no reason for that absence.</p>
<p>In the next number of days, we will certainly discuss resources in various Departments, or, indeed, the lack of them. If Members really understood the resources that are required from a Department and a Minister to provide an answer to a question, they would realise the seriousness of the issue. Over the next number of weeks, as we come to the end of the current Assembly, I ask for co-operation on the issue. I assure Members that if I have to address the issue again, a Member who is not in his or her place to ask a question will not be called to ask a supplementary question at Question Time in the House for some time. That is the only way that the matter can be dealt with.</p>
<p>I have raised my concern at the Business Committee and with the Whips, parties and Members. It seems to be falling on deaf ears. As Speaker, I have no choice but to take the action that I have outlined. This morning, I address the entire House and all parties. The situation cannot continue.</p>
<p>A Member might say to me that, at least, the Minister will have to provide a written answer if he or she is not in the House. I am not too sure that that will happen. I suggest that there might be some doubt as to whether Ministers would decide to forward a written answer to a Member who is not in the House to ask his or her question. We all have to be careful. None of us wants to go down this road &mdash; certainly, not me. However, Members have left me no choice. I will not address the issue again in the House. I am clear that we will keep a list of Members who are not in the House to ask their questions. If those Members are not called to ask supplementary questions, they will certainly know why. Let us have the co-operation of everyone in the House to ensure that there is an improvement and the situation does not happen again.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to update the Assembly on the outcome of the 2010-11 February monitoring round. The starting point of the monitoring round was the outcome of the December monitoring round. As Members will be aware, that round concluded with an overcommitment of &pound;14&middot;7 million in respect of current expenditure and no overcommitment in respect of capital investment.</p>
<p class="italic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
<p>On many occasions, I have highlighted the importance of exercising sound financial management to minimise any risk of any overspend at the block level, because that would have severe repercussions for the Executive. However, the Executive now find themselves in the unprecedented position of having proactively to manage down any possibility of generating an underspend at block level. That is because such an underspend will be lost to us, given the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to abolish the existing end-year flexibility (EYF) scheme. The context of the February monitoring round is, therefore, fundamentally different to previous years. I am concerned about that unilateral and punitive decision by the UK Government to refuse future drawdown, not only to any underspends generated in this financial year, but, as I have said to the House on many occasions, to the &pound;316 million of current expenditure EYF stock that we had built up.</p>
<p>I have registered my strong reservation about that decision in discussions with Treasury Ministers, as have my Scottish and Welsh counterparts. I have been informed that the UK Government will announce new EYF arrangements at the time of the UK Budget on 23 March. My officials have already highlighted to their Treasury counterparts that it is essential that the Northern Ireland Executive are properly consulted on the proposals for the new EYF scheme.</p>
<p>It is also important to point out that the Executive&rsquo;s allocations in the February monitoring round are constrained by the Assembly control totals, which were established in the spring Supplementary Estimates. In essence, although Departments may be able to process more spend than the limit set, to do so would breach an important Assembly control.</p>
<p>Before I go on to the outcome of the February monitoring round, I will highlight the level of reduced requirements surrendered and the level of bids submitted by Departments over the course of this round. Departments declared reduced requirements in this monitoring round of &pound;27&middot;1 million current expenditure and &pound;27&middot;2 million capital investment. That is a significant surrender of resources at this late stage in the financial year. It is disappointing that despite the warnings that have been given, we have reached this situation. The main element of the capital resources surrendered were &pound;17&middot;4 million from the Department for Regional Development (DRD), which came from Northern Ireland Water (NIW). Other large amounts of capital investment surrendered were &pound;3<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>2 million from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and &pound;2&middot;3 million from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD).</p>
<p>There are also significant reduced requirements in respect of current expenditure. The largest surrender by far was, again, from DRD in respect of Northern Ireland Water, which amounted to &pound;14&middot;9 million of non-cash and other resource depreciation. That large DRD surrender, along with more than &pound;4 million of its capital investment surrender, was due to the conversion to international financial reporting standards (IRFS). However, that conversion happened much earlier in the financial year, so it is particularly disappointing that DRD surrendered such large amounts to current and capital funding due to technical accountancy changes that had been known about for many months.</p>
<p>Another significant current expenditure reduced requirement was &pound;6&middot;1 million from the Department for Social Development (DSD), which related mainly to the Social Security Agency (SSA). Some &pound;3&middot;5 million of SSA surrender also related to the IFRS accountancy changes.</p>
<p>The full details relating to all the reduced requirements are included in the tables that are attached to the statement.</p>
<p>Although I acknowledge that some of that funding was surrendered because of reasons outside the relevant Departments&rsquo; control, I think that, had Departments exercised better financial management and forecasting, some of those resources could have been surrendered during earlier monitoring rounds. That would, of course, have enabled the money to be spent on what were, perhaps, more pressing needs.</p>
<p>In addition to the reduced requirements, the Executive allow Departments to move resources across spending areas where the movement is reflective of a proactive management decision that was taken to enable a Department to better manage emerging pressures within its existing baselines. That is to facilitate better financial management, and Departments that made use of that mechanism should be commended for their efforts to deal with emerging pressures. It has also been necessary, largely because of technical issues, to reclassify one amount between different categories of expenditure. Again, details of those changes are provided in the tables that are attached to the statement.</p>
<p>In addition to the reduced requirements surrendered by Departments, there was a number of centre adjustments that added amounts of resources available during the monitoring round. The most significant was a Barnett formula allocation resulting from the recent additional allocation by HM Treasury to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). That provided an additional 2010-11 allocation of &pound;8&middot;2 million current spending and &pound;2&middot;2 million capital investment to the Executive. There was also a number of technical transfers with Departments outside Northern Ireland and, furthermore, there was a small EU match funding surrender and small additional pressure relating to reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI) interest around the equal pay loan. The net effects of those adjustments was to make available a further &pound;2 million of current spending and &pound;0&middot;2 million of capital investment.</p>
<p>The net result of all those transactions, taking account of the December monitoring outcome, was to make available &pound;22&middot;6 million of current expenditure and &pound;29&middot;6 million in capital investment allocation.</p>
<p>Against those amounts of resources available, Departments submitted bids for &pound;19&middot;9 million of current expenditure pressures and &pound;19<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>4 million in respect of capital investment. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) bid for an additional &pound;10 million of current expenditure resources on the basis of exceptional and unforeseen circumstances. Given the overall level of resources available, the Executive agreed to meet that bid to ensure that the funding remained in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>There was a number of further current expenditure allocations. Of those, &pound;4 million was allocated to DSD to provide additional funding to the Housing Executive following the increased activity due to the cold weather in December, and &pound;4 million went to DRD to fund additional roads maintenance and additional Northern Ireland Water costs. Both those pressures were a direct result of the severe weather in December. Some &pound;0&middot;8 million was allocated to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) for the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund, and &pound;0&middot;2 million was provided to the Department of the Environment (DOE) to address inescapable pay pressures resulting from the shortfall in planning receipts and to provide emergency financial assistance to district councils.</p>
<p>The Executive allocated &pound;8&middot;6 million of capital investment to DRD to fund essential safety works at the City of Derry Airport. I know that that will please the Member sitting to my left. That includes an upgrade for the runway and the infrastructure to meet the safety requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority. A further &pound;6 million was allocated to DRD to fund strategic roads improvements and structural maintenance. I know that that will greatly satisfy the Member for Strangford, who has been studying potholes across his constituency with great vigour over the past number of weeks. Some &pound;4&middot;5 million was provided to DHSSPS to fund a small number of capital investment projects across health trusts, and &pound;0&middot;3 million was allocated to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) for the development of motorsport.</p>
<p>Those allocations totalled &pound;19&middot;4 million. Although some &pound;10 million of capital resources remain, it was not possible to allocate that funding to specific Departments because no further bids were made as part of this round. However, I am minded to consider favourably a late submission from the Department of Education seeking to draw down a further &pound;2&middot;2 million in capital. I hope that that can be covered by the time we progress to the provisional out-turn.</p>
<p>This monitoring round concluded with a number of significant allocations to Departments. In fact, we were able to meet all bids by Departments over the course of the monitoring round. Those resource allocations will help to deliver essential public services to the benefit of people in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>As we approach the end of the financial year, I have emphasised again to my Executive colleagues the importance of exercising sound financial management. That is particularly important this year given the circumstances facing the Executive. Although we need to ensure that there will be no breach of departmental budget control totals, it will also be crucial to minimise any end-year underspends because, as I have already highlighted, any and all underspends will be lost to the Executive due to the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to abolish the EYF scheme. I commend the February monitoring round to the Assembly.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement. Listening to the Health Minister and his chief spin doctor on the radio last week, one could be forgiven for thinking that the Finance Minister had been habitually unfair to the Health Department and its budget. However, I see from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has been allocated an additional &pound;10 million in current expenditure and &pound;4&middot;5 million in capital expenditure. Will the Minister outline just how generous he and the monitoring round process have been to the Health Minister and his budget over the past number of years?</p>

<p>The Department of Health bid for &pound;10 million in this monitoring round to deal with pressures, most of which were, I think, around drugs etc. It is significant that we were told in December that that pressure was &pound;30 million. I have always believed that Departments sometimes need to look within their existing resources to see what savings can be found. Miraculously, that figure has come down from &pound;30 million in December to &pound;10 million in this round. That has been made available, plus &pound;4&middot;5 million for the small capital spend. Of course, &pound;20 million was made available in the June monitoring round and another, I think, &pound;3&middot;6 million in capital spend in September. Do not forget that the Department of Health was also exempted from the &pound;30 million reduction that had to be levied against the Department as a result of the &pound;120 million fall in our Budget due to the mini-Budget that the Government at Westminster launched in June.</p>
<p>If we look at the additional allocations this year, we can see that they amount to nearly &pound;70 million, which is roughly a 1&middot;4% addition to the total health budget. That is significant. The Member has made an important point. The extra money shows that, when looking at allocations and money that is available or surrendered by Departments, the Executive always give the Health Department a great deal of priority in the money that is made available in the reallocations.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s handing back of the bulk of its money may well test the public&rsquo;s understanding. If that relatively high level of reduced requirement is down to poor financial management, are there steps in place to rectify that? Will the Minister indicate the expected underspend this year? As a consequence of that underspend, how much money could be lost to the Treasury?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="12:30" url="">
<p>First, financial management in Northern Ireland Water is the responsibility of the Minister for Regional Development. All that I, as Finance Minister, can do is emphasise to Departments the need to ensure that they flag up underspends.</p>
<p>There are sometimes good reasons for underspends. For example, in the case of DRD, a lot of the capital works scheduled for December could not take place because of the bad weather and the other pressures on the Department. In some cases, contract prices came in lower than expected because of the recession, which led to savings on capital projects. In some cases, planning delays meant that work that Departments had anticipated taking forward did not happen. In addition, accountancy changes have affected the amount of depreciation on assets. However, the point that I am making &mdash; it is, I think, the point that the Member is getting at &mdash; is that some of those things could have been known about at an earlier stage and, therefore, the money should have been surrendered. That is why it is important that Ministers get on top of the work of their Department and its arm&rsquo;s-length bodies to ensure that there are no surprises at the end of the year when the money cannot be spent.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement.</p>
<p>The significant capital investment surrendered by a number of Departments is worrying, given the current economic climate in which many firms are looking for jobs, particularly in the construction sector. I note in the Minister&rsquo;s statement that &pound;10 million of capital resources remain that it is not possible to allocate because no further bids have been made. The Minister will say that it is up to each Department to do its own thing, but is there any way that we can drive forward more efficiency in Departments? I look to the Minister of Finance and Personnel to see if an initiative can be implemented to drive forward much more efficiency to ensure that laxness in Departments no longer remains and to ensure that money is not wastefully handed back to the Treasury.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="12:30" url="">
<p>The Member makes a good point. It is, of course, for the Department of Finance and Personnel to monitor the money that goes out to Departments on a regular basis. There are two levels at which that can be done. The first is at ministerial level. It is my responsibility at Executive level to reinforce the point to Ministers that not only are they required to manage their resources but there is political fallout if those resources are not managed. People will find it inexplicable that we are complaining about the Treasury snatching &pound;316 million from us, which it did when it took away the end-year flexibility stock, if we make any further contribution to that. We will not know if we have until the provisional out-turn figures are published at the end of May, because there might be some overspends between now and then that will be offset against unallocated capital money that we still have.</p>
<p>My officials regularly meet financial accounting officers in Departments to reinforce that message. We have to reinforce the message at a political level and a departmental level. Ministers have to know that there is political embarrassment it we give money back at a time when, as the Member rightly pointed out, we are having economic difficulties. I hope that the combination of those pressures gets the message through. Members also have a part to play, and I hope that they will play it. When Committees are consulted about monitoring rounds, surrenders of money etc, Committee members have a vital role to play in speaking to officials and probing on the amount of money that is given back and when it is given back.</p>

<p>I also thank the Minister for his statement. In a similar vein to the last question, will the Minister confirm what other Departments had a problem with the depreciation of assets as a result of the use of international financial reporting standards? Presumably, many other Departments have large asset bases that will have fallen as a result of the use of those different standards. Did those Departments act in a much more responsible manner earlier in the year?</p>

<p>As I pointed out in the statement, the two Departments with the biggest returns on that basis were DSD and DRD. There were no significant underspends from other Departments as a result of the changes in IFRS standards.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement. Will the Minister tell the House why the recent allocation of the Barnett formula by the Treasury to the Department of Work and Pensions did not come to us until so late in the year?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="12:30" url="">
<p>That is a decision by the Treasury. What happens is that the Treasury decides to spend the extra money and once that has been spent there is consequential for Northern Ireland, which is calculated on the basis of the Barnett formula. If the Treasury makes an allocation to the Department of Work and Pensions late in the year, the Barnett consequential will only come to us late in the year. Obviously that is what happened in this case.</p>

<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Like my colleague Gregory Campbell and others, I obviously have a particular interest in the City of Derry Airport and the &pound;8.6 million it has been allocated. Will the Minister confirm whether a direction will be required from the Minster for Regional Development to spend that money?</p>
<p>I will pick up on some of the comments that have been made about the &pound;10 million that has not been spent. Like many others, I am committed to the city of culture in Derry. Given that Derry City Council did not make a business case, is it too late to have some of that money allocated to the city of culture?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.17" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="12:30" url="">
<p>On the Member&rsquo;s second question, the answer is that the &pound;10 million that has yet to be allocated has now been reduced to &pound;8 million because of the bid that will be paid to the Department of Education. That &pound;8 million has to be spent before the end of the financial year. So, it is not a case of saying, &ldquo;Look, the city of culture is going to need money, can we not allocate it now?&rdquo;. If there are no projects on which the money can be spent in this financial year, it cannot be allocated, because that money cannot be carried over. I am not aware of any Department having identified bids for the city of culture in this financial year.</p>
<p>The Minister for Regional Development will need to make a direction for the allocation to the airport, because the business case for the airport would not normally have been accepted. It was perhaps fortuitous that the money was available when my colleague Mr Campbell and representatives from Londonderry council made the case for the airport. We promised that we would try to do something if we could, and, because of the way that the February monitoring round worked out, we were able to do so.</p>
<p>I recently gave an interview on Radio Foyle. I was told that the draft Budget and the allocations in it were not good for the north-west, but I pointed out that the allocations for the north-west were very good. That illustrates that when a case was made&mdash;one was made very forcefully to the First Minister, the deputy First Minister, the Minister for Regional Development and me&mdash;a direction was made and when the money was found it was allocated. That allocation will be a welcome boost for ratepayers in Londonderry, who would otherwise have had to bear the cost.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement. The Assembly and the Departments do not want to hand back any money. However, it is important that the spend is made correctly and not handed out for repainting corridors simply to get the money spent. Does the Minister know whether any Department has indicated an overspend?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.19" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="12:45" url="">
<p>The final position will not be known until we have the provisional out-turn figures, and, from memory, we will not know that until the end of May. We are not aware of any Departments declaring massive overspends or underspends at present. If there is no way to allocate the &pound;8 million capital that is left and if no other bids come in between now and the end of the year, it will either be offset against overspends or it will go back to the Treasury. We will not know that until we have the provisional out-turn figures in May.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement. I am concerned that there is no proper financial planning to provide emergency financial assistance to district councils should we have another cold spell similar to the one we had at Christmas. The Minister of the Environment encouraged councils to do more, and the Minister for Regional Development encouraged councils to agree a suitable deal with Roads Service, with councils being offered a measly &pound;860 to conclude a deal. We just need to think of all the bin lorries that were out on the roads, and I congratulate the councils that managed that. Councils need funding that will allow them &mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.22" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90358" speakername="Danny Kinahan" time="12:45" url="">
<p>My question is just coming. We need the funding to be there. The emergency assistance mentioned today covers help only with the water crisis. What plans does the Minister have for financial planning, either now or in the future, to give councils more money so that they can take action if we have another cold spell?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.23" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="12:45" url="">
<p>The mechanism by which assistance can be given in such emergencies is the Financial Assistance Act (Northern Ireland) 2009. Allocations will be made in the monitoring round today. Money will be made available to DSD for the emergency work that the Housing Executive had to carry out as a result of the cold spell; from memory, &pound;1 million goes to Northern Ireland Water for the extra work that it had to carry out in December; and, in September, DRD received &pound;1&middot;4 million in financial assistance towards the flooding in Fermanagh. Therefore, mechanisms are in place for that in the form of the 2009 Act. Some of the money that came through the Act has been distributed and dealt with by councils &mdash; for example, the &pound;1,000 payment to households as a result of flooding. When it is shown that there is a case to be made, the Executive have not been found wanting, either in monitoring rounds or in straight allocations to Departments, as has happened here. As the money allocated to flooding indicates, there is nothing to stop that money going through councils to people at local level.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement. Like many others, I am concerned about the &pound;10 million. I am sure that many small firms in particular will be scratching their head and wondering why we did not get it right. Will the Minister and officials analyse how we might do things better, other than the late returns and the timing? Given the situation with the schools estate and our colleges, I am surprised that the Minister of Education and the Minister for Employment and Learning do not appear to have made bids in time. Will there still be an opportunity for them to do so?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.25" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="12:45" url="">
<p>I emphasise the point that it is a case not just of making bids in time but of how much money can be spent between now and the end of the financial year. I must add that important caveat. This is one reason why I emphasised to Departments that they should not leave the surrender of reduced requirements until February. They must look ahead and, if there is any chance, surrender them in September or December, so that they can be allocated for the kinds of purposes that the Member has rightly drawn to the House&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>How can we improve the monitoring? In an earlier answer to the Member&rsquo;s party colleague, I indicated what needed to be done at a political level and official level. At the end of the day, this comes down to Departments deciding to hoard money &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;. If every Department does that, we finish up with a situation such as we have today, in which &pound;54 million is surrendered six weeks before the end of the financial year. That is not good, and it is not easy to spend that kind of money at this time of the year.</p>

<p>Capital moneys were returned by NI Water. Is the real lesson not that the existing structure simply does not facilitate the long-term capitalisation of NI Water, which is so absolutely necessary? Does the Minister agree that the Minister for Regional Development&rsquo;s proposal to bring NI Water in house would not assist in that matter?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.4.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="12:45" url="">
<p>One could argue that to bring Northern Ireland Water in house would exacerbate the problem because we would be tied even more tightly to financial rules about carry-over etc. Usually, it is easier to have a looser financial arrangement the further we remove such bodies from government.</p>
<p>The Member made an important point. In looking at the future governance structure of the likes of Northern Ireland Water, especially where there are long-term capital projects, and how they are financed and delivered, a case could probably be made that a looser arrangement and connection, whether through mutualisation or whatever, would give the flexibility that the Member rightly identified as sometimes necessary where there are huge ongoing and rolling capital commitments.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am sorry for being late. I got caught up in something in the Great Hall.</p>
<p>My initial reason for wanting to amend the stated period from &ldquo;3 years&rdquo; to &ldquo;12 months&rdquo; was to take into consideration the problems that some clubs may have when new committees are elected, which happens fairly regularly in registered clubs. They end up with a new secretary who is not used to the bookkeeping or to the way in which the club is run. Clubs could be heavily penalised because of resulting mistakes, and that could happen if a club continually changes its committee. To retain the three-year period could penalise a club. If possible, I wish to support another amendment that reduces the period from three years to two years. If such an amendment can be adopted, I propose not to move amendment No 1.</p>

<p>I am checking the time and the place, because I am not sure whether this is actually happening. It is slightly surreal. Despite the previous contributions, I presume that I am to address the entire group of amendments. I will try to get things back on track. I will begin by making remarks on the first group of amendments as the Chairperson of the Committee.</p>
<p>I will deal first with amendment Nos 1 to 4, although some of those may not be there now. These amendments refer to the discretion of the courts in respect of penalty points for registered clubs. Amendment Nos 1 and 2 will allow clubs to repeat certain offences punishable with a level 3 fine over a shorter period without necessarily receiving penalty points from the court. Amendment Nos 3 and 4 would allow clubs to repeat certain offences punishable with a level 4 fine over a shorter period without necessarily receiving penalty points from the court.</p>
<p>Amendment Nos 5 and 6 would restrict the shelf life of any penalty points received by a registered club to either one or two years. If amendment Nos 5 and 6 are passed, registered clubs will probably have to commit two offences attracting a level 3 or level 4 fine in a shorter period before they have their licences suspended automatically. I believe that these amendments are motivated by a well-meaning desire to protect volunteer club officers who may inadvertently breach some of the rules associated with the Registration of Clubs (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. The Committee had some sympathy with this situation. However, the Committee accepted the Department&rsquo;s argument that the provisions, as drafted, give clubs the opportunity to show due diligence in respect of offences.</p>
<p>The Committee did not accept that the Bill should be changed to allow more discretion for the courts in respect of these offences. As I said at Consideration Stage, the Department advised that prosecutions under the Registration of Clubs (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 are actually very rare. There was one in 2009 compared to 168 in the licensed sector in the same period. Therefore, the Committee felt, following a division, that amendments similar to these were unnecessary.</p>
<p>Amendment Nos 9 and 10 refer to changes to the licensing hours for clubs. The idea is that sporting clubs could allow younger members to be in the licensed parts of their premises until 11.00 pm or 10.00 pm rather than 9.00 pm. The Committee heard evidence in support of that from the Federation of Clubs, the GAA and the Golfing Union of Ireland that was consistent with our position on underage drinking controls. The Committee did not support proposals to amend the Bill in that regard.</p>
<p>Amendment No 11 refers to the easing of restrictions on advertising by registered clubs. The Committee received a lot of comment on this issue from groups representing pubs and hotels. They argued that clubs already have an economic advantage as a consequence of their paying lower rates and having access to membership fees to subsidise alcohol prices. The pubs and hotels also insisted that the law is already being flouted in that regard, as many clubs reportedly advertise Christmas events and wedding functions for non-members. The clubs represented disputed much of that and insisted that the easing of advertising restrictions was essential for their survival.</p>
<p>Liquor licensing is fraught with difficulties and competing interests, and I know that the Bill seeks to strike a balance between those two parts of the licensed trade. The Committee felt that the Bill generally achieves that objective and, therefore, did not support amendments similar to amendment No 11.</p>
<p>In a personal or party capacity, I will address the three broad groups within the first group of amendments and focus particularly on the three-year shelf life for penalty points put on a licence. The shelf life is currently three years in the Bill. There was a proposal to reduce it to 12 months, but that has disappeared. The proposal to reduce it to two years is the one that is before us.</p>
<p>The record will show that I raised concerns about the three-year shelf life at Committee Stage. I feel that that is a long time to have penalty points sitting there, and that it is somewhat inconsistent. Maybe some of us have personal experience or are certainly well aware of penalty points on driving licences, and that is &mdash;</p>

<p>He is declaring an interest. I thought that he was going to ask me whether I had an interest to declare, so I am glad that I can now dodge that. Some may have personal experience of penalty points remaining on a driving licence for two years.</p>
<p>I questioned the three-year shelf life from two different perspectives. The Member opposite and, indeed, others pointed out that many clubs are staffed, by and large, by volunteers, many of whom are inexperienced, even though there is a responsibility on them, and that to endorse points on a licence for such clubs may, therefore, be seen as too burdensome and unfair. There is some merit in that argument.</p>
<p>During evidence sessions at Committee Stage, I raised concerns about big retailers who have huge volumes of sales, because there is potential for them to breach some of the restrictions on their licences. I felt that a 12-month shelf life for penalty points might mean that we end up with a scenario in which premises where certain offences are committed twice in one year could be closed down, which would have an economic impact on those employed there and, indeed, the wider community. The robust defence from the Department at that time was that those offences &mdash; selling alcohol to a minor and selling alcohol to people who are already drunk, neither of which anyone supports &mdash; are serious offences and should be treated as such. The Department&rsquo;s view was that keeping the penalty points on a licence for three years would better instil good behaviour right across the licensed trade.</p>
<p>On reflection, though, I am glad that the Member opposite has withdrawn his amendment because, whatever my sympathies about a three-year shelf life being too long, I think that a 12-month shelf life is too short. That would have created the potential for premises, be they clubs or pubs, to offend habitually and to get into a pattern of not doing things that they should be doing. Premises should produce their accounts and adhere to what may be seen as the less important aspects of their trade. Equally, they should not be selling to minors or people who are already drunk. I felt that a 12-month shelf life could create a situation in which a club that had its licence endorsed with points, which then lapsed after 12 months, could repeat an offence towards the end of the next 12 months, so there would never be an occasion when it would lose its licence. I therefore think that two years is a sufficient period to catch habitually bad behaviour. It is robust enough to allow us to continue to bear down on the bad behaviour that happens in a very limited number of licensed premises and to catch people out over that period. A 12-month shelf life is just a little too lenient. My party, therefore, supports amendment Nos 2, 4 and 6.</p>
<p>I expressed concerns about advertising by clubs at Consideration Stage. I would not say that there is no need for advertising, but registered clubs should have limited opportunity to advertise functions or events on their premises. We need to be very clear on that point in this debate, and I ask the Minister to be equally clear about it in his response. If we agree to make the amendment to lift the restrictions on advertising, we must do so in the full knowledge that it is not advertising as we necessarily know it. It is not the kind of advertising that, for example, a restaurant uses to promote some sort of offer; it is not like that. It is a very restricted form of advertising, essentially to members only. I know that the amendment states that. I have expressed my concerns about this issue previously, because even though that restriction is there, advertising is very clearly being abused in some cases. I cited the example of the Civil Service club, no less.</p>
<p>From the top to the bottom, there is confusion about what can be advertised. Therefore, that needs to be made clear. I have concerns about the advantage that such advertising could give to the club sector. Even if we are clear about what we are doing, I am concerned that the provision could still be open to abuse. If, as is made clear in the amendment, advertising were for members only, perhaps the Minister could issue guidance through the Department to the registered club sector to make clear what it can advertise, who it can advertise to and who it can target. That would make the distinctions involved very clear. Obviously, such guidance would also be issued to the Civil Service to make sure that it is absolutely clear about what was going on. Regardless of whether the amendment passes or not, confusion exists, which may be compounded by any changes that we make. Therefore, if the amendment passes, it is an opportune moment for the Minister to issue guidance to the registered club sector to clarify the new situation.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about minors in clubs. For a number of reasons, my party will not support any amendment on the time until which minors are allowed in licensed premises in registered clubs. Consistency is required. My understanding is that the same restriction of 9.00 pm exists for bars, hotels and pubs. Therefore, I do not think that it is fair to treat clubs in an inconsistent way. We tried to be consistent throughout the process in applying one change to both sectors. I understand the point that clubs make about prize-givings or summer games that go on quite late, with kids perhaps going into a bar after 9.00 pm. However, just because I understand it does not mean that I have to agree with it.</p>
<p>Everybody can take their own view on those issues. However, as a father, I feel uneasy about those amendments. We are not talking about children aged 16 or 17 being allowed into premises. We are talking about younger children. I have difficulty and personal unease about amending the law to allow children to be in registered premises later than 9.00 pm. To do so would be inconsistent and would run contrary to what I thought was an emerging consensus about young people and alcohol. Far from being puritanical or going down a prohibitionist-type route, I thought that we were being a bit more mature and sensible about how we expose young people in our society to alcohol. Everybody knows the difficulties about exposing young people to alcohol. Between 9.00 pm and 11.00 pm, a lot of alcohol can be consumed on a licensed premises, whether that is a club, pub, bar or hotel. My colleagues and I are uneasy and concerned about the impression that such a change would give, the inconsistency with other measures that we are trying to take in the Bill and with other measures that the Minister is exploring elsewhere in trying to clamp down on the misuse and abuse of alcohol.</p>
<p>Although I understand the point that is being put forward, we have to be careful about the message that we send out about young people and alcohol. Here, if we choose to pass one or other of those amendments, we would be saying that young people could be in bars and exposed to the consumption of alcohol well into the night, even, as one amendment suggests, right up to 11.00 pm, which is normal closing time. I do not know about anybody else, but I would not want any of my kids in a bar or club until normal closing time. We need to be careful about the message that we are sending out about the use and, more importantly, the abuse of alcohol and its effect on young people.</p>
<p>I long for the situation that appears to be prevalent in &mdash;</p>

<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>I long for the situation that appears to be prevalent in other parts of Europe, where there is a much more mature attitude to the consumption of alcohol and young people&rsquo;s exposure to it. It is not that other countries are without their problems. However, they certainly have a better attitude towards alcohol. We do not have that here. Everybody knows the problems. The Member who is about to intervene frequently tells us about what goes on in streets in his hometown. I will give way to him now if he wants to tell us about that.</p>

<p>Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. My point is that 73% of alcohol consumed is now consumed in the home. To follow that logic, there should, to some degree, be a restriction on drinking in the house, because children are probably exposed to that drink culture at home far more than they would be in the type of clubs that we are talking about. The people in charge of the clubs or teams have a very serious supervisory role in looking after the children. Only approximately 28% of alcohol sold is consumed on licensed premises, and I think that that is a point worth making.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.5.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90285" speakername="Simon Hamilton" time="13:15" url="">
<p>I thank the Member for his intervention; he is right that there has been a change in culture around the consumption of alcohol. People have exercised freedom of choice over where they consume alcohol, no doubt helped by pricing considerations, which is our other concern, so that is a very valid point.</p>
<p>I would not want the Member to start encouraging colleagues who may want to look at the consumption of alcohol in the home as well. There is a very real difference when it comes to us, as a legislature, controlling behaviour in the home. We can only do that in ways that would not interfere with people&rsquo;s liberties and freedoms. There is a marked difference in what we, as an institution, can do about the consumption of alcohol where we have control over it. I take the Member&rsquo;s points on board, and I agree that we should encourage more sensible consumption of alcohol. However, I do not think that that is assisted by sending out the message, as it may be interpreted, that it is OK to sit in the bar of a registered club until 10.00 pm or 11.00 pm. It is inconsistent with the general movement on this issue, which is not to be draconian or puritanical, but sensible and moderate.</p>
<p>The fact that children can only stay in a licensed premises until 9.00 pm is a recognition that there needs to be a cut-off time. I do not think that there is any compelling evidence to push it beyond that time. It is not that the evidence from the registered club sector is not useful, but I think that it is outweighed by other, social considerations about the consumption of alcohol and the exposure of young people to that. That does not mean that I do not have sympathy for the Member&rsquo;s point or an understanding as to why the Members have tabled their amendments, but I do not agree with them.</p>
<p>I have previously highlighted what I thought were other inconsistencies in the Bill, which have been dealt with by subsequent amendments from the Minister. It would be a backward step to make either amendment. We should be sending out a very clear message, and I think that we all share the view, that we want people to be careful about the consumption of alcohol, the way that it is consumed and the way that people are exposed to it in our society.</p>
<p>I reiterate that we, as a party, do not support either amendment. However, we will be supporting the other amendments, particularly those on the shelf life of penalty points, as two years is a reasonable and sensible compromise.</p>

<p>We support amendment Nos 2, 4 and 6 as put forward by Mrs Bradley and Mr Tom Gallagher. During a presentation from stakeholders, I had some sympathy with them about the fact that the shelf life of penalty points &mdash;three years &mdash; is a long time. That is quite draconian, particularly when huge supermarkets can sell alcohol to hundreds of thousands of people in that three-year period.</p>
<p>It can be easy enough to make a mistake twice or three times in three years. I feel comfortable with the SDLP&rsquo;s compromise of two years. It is a more common sense approach, but I certainly do not agree with shortening the period to 12 months.</p>
<p>Amendment No 10 is about prohibiting young persons from bars. I understand what stakeholders said about sports clubs, particularly in the summer, holding events that might not finish until 8.00 pm or 9.00 pm and young people not being allowed to go into the bar for a soft drink. However, I agree with Mr Hamilton: we have a growing problem with alcohol. If we are taking measures such as banning irresponsible drinks promotions, and if we are trying to tackle the problem of alcohol abuse in our whole population, we should not encourage our young people to stay in bars, where adults are consuming alcohol, for too long. However, I am comfortable with the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment to extend the time from 9.00 pm to 10.00 pm. We support amendment No 10.</p>
<p>As regards restriction on advertisements relating to functions in registered clubs, I am certain that clubs have, in general, very efficient means of informing their members of coming events through club newsletters or their membership list. They can circulate notices in advance to let people know. It is certainly not essential for them to have public advertisements.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.5.29" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90300" speakername="Fra McCann" time="13:15" url="">
<p>I should have done this at the start, but I declare an interest as a member of Cumman na M&eacute;irleach and the Irish National Foresters. One of the things that I raised in the previous debate on this Bill was that some clubs have a membership of 600 or 1,000 people, so it is very difficult for them to keep in constant touch with their membership. Some of their members probably live miles away from the club premises, so the only way in which people can find out whether there are functions in a particular club is through advertising. The Chairperson said that perhaps the Minister could issue advice to clubs about advertising to members only. Having spoken to a number of club members, I know that clubs are dying a slow death. Many clubs close their premises, perhaps on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, because they are not being used. The only way that they can keep themselves alive is through members&rsquo; functions. There has to be a better mechanism for them to contact their members than just writing letters.</p>

<p>I accept what the Member is saying, but we have to be fair to pubs because they are also dying on their feet. We need to be fair to commercial premises as well. I will keep an open mind and wait to hear what the Minister will say about guidance being issued.</p>

<p>I agree with amendment Nos 2, 4 and 6. There is common sense in reducing from three years to two years the period that the points system can be kept on a club&rsquo;s licence record.</p>
<p>Indeed, three years could be open to abuse by individuals with a grudge against a club, and I am the first to recognise that such a scenario could arise. I agree with my colleague that reducing it to 12 months could open up a scenario in which, if you are clever and time your abuses correctly, you might get away with it. Therefore, two years is sensible, and my party supports that proposal.</p>
<p>I find amendment No 11intriguing. However, it is also intriguing to drive past adverts for the Civil Service Sports Social Club, which is a short distance from the House. If I were to walk through the door of that club to avail myself of the meal being advertised, I wonder which three members would sign me in. I have my doubts as to whether anyone would sign me in. As I told the Minister previously, I doubt whether a member of the Civil Service club would sign me in to anywhere, although that might be more to do with my attitude to alcohol. I find all that intriguing. Nevertheless, common sense tells me that it is a bit like the warning on cigarette boxes: if the warning is there, at least we would have fulfilled our part by stating that a club should, by and large, be for members only. For that reason, I will not oppose amendment No 11.</p>
<p>I know that some clubs &mdash; generally the smaller ones &mdash; need to find ways to increase revenue flows. The thing that amuses me about that is that those clubs will not be going out with huge advertising campaigns. I doubt whether even the larger Belfast clubs will run major campaigns. That having been said, it is hard to know what effect amendment No 11 will or will not have, although it would certainly do away with the anomaly of having to drive past advertising that should not be there.</p>
<p>Amendment No 10 refers to young persons. The Committee and the House is fully aware of my concerns about young people and drinking. The irony is that I concur fully with the second group of amendments, which try to effect a mechanism to reduce the level of underage drinking in Northern Ireland. That is aimed at promoting sensible attitudes towards alcohol. However, we have to be open and honest: in Northern Ireland, and probably across the UK and Ireland, we have a huge difficulty with attitudes to alcohol. People in this country do not go out for a quiet half pint or pint. That just does not happen. The culture is that you go out and drink the place dry, after which someone carries you home, or, as my wife could tell you, the Ambulance Service ends up carrying you into hospital with someone else carrying you home the following morning. Our society&rsquo;s unfortunate attitude to alcohol consumption leads to alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>As a parent, I find the proposal to increase the present watershed for children in clubs from 9.00 pm to 10.00 pm or 11.00 pm incompatible with what we are trying to achieve through the Bill. I have had to attend functions in clubs with my family, because, let us be honest, these days, some clubs hold wedding ceremonies and all sorts of other ceremonies. Consequently, if it is a family function, you take your children along. The fact is that, as usual at such events, I sit drinking my Diet Coke, feeling totally out of place and hearing things that I probably should not hear because others are not drinking Diet Coke. Therefore, under no circumstances would I want my child to be there after 9.00 pm.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p>I do not believe for one minute that I will improve my child&rsquo;s education about or attitude towards alcohol by having them there between 9.00 pm and 10.00 pm or 11.00 pm and beyond. Unfortunately, the reality is that, beyond 9.00 pm, the formal ceremonies are over and the dull, boring speeches that we all sit and listen to are finished. What happens after that? The entertainment comes on, and, unfortunately, the drink goes in.</p>

<p>Apologies, a LeasCheann Comhairle. When the Committee was being lobbied by and holding meetings with the Federation of Clubs over a couple of years, members at first argued against any extension of hours or young people being allowed into clubs. During Committee Stage, sports clubs came in &mdash; mainly the GAA and others &mdash; and said that, because most of their sports for young people were played on summer evenings, some did not finish until 9.00 pm or 9.30 pm. Therefore, they wanted to be in a position to take young people back to their club to give them a mineral and a bag of crisps and maybe even to discuss match tactics, which needed hours to be extended.</p>
<p>I talked to somebody recently who was going to collect their child who was playing a match in Belfast, and they told their child to wait for them at the club because it was safe and not to stand about anywhere else that might have left them open to danger. There are reasons why we changed our mind on that matter in Committee, not least that it offered the best possible way forward for clubs and for kids who participate in sports.</p>

<p>I thank the Member for his intervention and for reminding me about those issues, which we looked at. I have been in many clubs, and I have seen how junior clubs work. I do not buy into the argument that anybody training beyond 9.00 pm must be taken to the club where the bar is open, into an atmosphere where drink is being poured. I have seen many a club that has its youth teams in after 9.00 pm, but one thing is certain: they are not taken into the bar. They certainly are not taken into the bar to be addressed on how to improve their sporting performance. I do not think that anybody could stand up in the House and argue that the best place to give young people, or older people for that matter, any direction on their sporting prowess is in a bar, while everybody else there is probably getting less and less coherent as the night goes on. I do not think that that is a sensible or a sane argument. I certainly do not think that it is an argument that you will find most parents in Northern Ireland buying into. That is my fear about all of this. The idea that we can have children in clubs beyond 9.00 pm will not be widely accepted by parents. I do not care whether those parents send their children to the sporting organisations that have been mentioned here. I send my children to sporting organisations, and I would not like to think for one second that they would be asked to go into such an environment after 9.00 pm. In fact, I would not like them to be in such an environment at any time, but that is another matter.</p>
<p>Children might be at family functions in clubs until 9.00 pm. I have no issue with that. I have no issue with the law as it stands. However, there is something completely inconsistent about the idea of having children in that atmosphere any later than 9.00 pm. It will send out the wrong message to our young people if we keep them in clubs until 10.00 pm or 11.00 pm, in an atmosphere in which, like it or not, alcohol flows freely. As I said, all the formalities are over by 9.00 pm, so the entertainment and drink that goes with it are the only reasons for staying. As a parent, I certainly do not want to send the message to my children that that is morally acceptable.</p>
<p>Members opposite have raised the issue of people consuming alcohol at home. I put it on record that I have witnessed parents in public forums handing over alcohol to children who are nine and 10 years of age. Whether that is morally acceptable is a judgement that society has to make. I think that it is totally wrong that that happens in our society. We can bury our heads in the sand, but it happens, and drink is given out freely by some parents to their children in their home even though they are under age. That is a moral judgement to be made by those parents. Does it lead to a better attitude to alcohol in the home? I have strong doubts about that.</p>
<p>I have worked with organisations that have looked after those already addicted to alcohol even before they reach the legal age to drink, and it is unfortunate that that happens in our society. It is regrettable that underage drinking takes place in homes. I am not going on a moral crusade, but I ask parents to think long and hard about their attitudes to alcohol and how they promote a more responsible attitude towards it to their children. There are dangers, and we cannot bury our heads in the sand. If alcohol were not so popular and if we could remove it from society, we could avoid a massive dent in our health budget. As I said, my wife, who is a paramedic, would probably be unemployed. I am told that 85% of the incidents that paramedics respond to are alcohol-related. If those were taken away, our Ambulance Service would be decimated, as it would no longer be required. However, that is not the case; that is not how society works.</p>
<p>It is inconsistent of us to talk about moving to 10.00 pm or 11.00 pm, which would bring children into an atmosphere in which the wrong attitude to alcohol would be introduced to them.</p>

<p>First, I would like to explain the approach I took at Consideration Stage and since on the substantive matters in the amendments in group 1. At Consideration Stage, I said that there were three matters that I wished to consider further: young persons on licensed club premises after 9.00 pm; what might be endorsed and for how long on a certificate of registration of licensed clubs; and advertising in respect of licensed clubs. I stress that all three matters are in respect of licensed clubs only. Whatever view the Assembly may take on those three matters &mdash; the Executive have a view, which I will confirm shortly &mdash; the amendments tabled today by Mr McCann, Mr Brady, Mr Gallagher and Mrs Bradley impact on licensed clubs only. I am sorry, I will correct that: children and young people being on premises will impact on sporting clubs only. Although the wider amendments will impact on licensed clubs, the proposal in respect of underage people is in respect of sporting clubs only.</p>

<p>Although I agree with the previous Member who spoke about the drinking culture and the problems that it causes, particularly the health-related problems, there appears to be an implication that, if you allow your children to be looked after in a sporting club by people who are responsible and are ensuring that there is discipline etc, suddenly after 9.00 pm the scenario changes and the people who were supervising children before 9.00 pm suddenly lose interest and do not continue to do so until the children are picked up by their parents. I argue that that is simply not the case and that people in sporting clubs, such as the coaches who look after the teams, are very responsible. I also presume that they have all been vetted under child protection measures. Such people do not change. An extra hour or whatever it may be will not make a huge difference. Those people will still be responsible for the children they bring into the club, and they will continue to be responsible until the parents of those children pick them up. I just wanted to make that point.</p>

<p>I thank the Member for that intervention. Although I am mindful of my Executive responsibility for the various matters that are under debate, I also think that, in the broad sense, that observation is correct. Parents and other adults in licensed premises, of whatever nature, display high standards of responsibility. Sporting clubs have a slightly different character, and parents and other adults display the particular responsibility that applies in those premises. However, I stress that the amendments that deal with penalty points and the advertising of functions extend to all clubs and only to clubs. I also stress that the proposals that deal with underage people being in licensed premises extend only to sporting clubs. There is a difference in the proposals that has to be acknowledged. That must be acknowledged, because we are legislators and we have to create certainty so that there is no doubt about what we are legislating for.</p>
<p>I felt that further assessment was required on the three matters that I just mentioned, and that has been reflected in the debate. I also felt that, whatever way the vote on those three matters fell at Consideration Stage, the past couple of weeks have demonstrated that it is useful to bear down on various legislative proposals to see whether there is a better way forward. Given that, I acknowledge Mr McCann and Mr Brady for the amendments that they tabled at Consideration Stage and for those that they tabled for today. I also acknowledge Mr Gallagher and Mrs Bradley for the amendments that they tabled for today. At the same time, I acknowledge OFMDFM&rsquo;s view on a paper that I put to it on advertising functions on club premises. It is always useful to keep interrogating clauses to determine whether a better clause could be drafted at a subsequent stage, including Further Consideration Stage. Without prejudice to the way in which the votes will go today, I acknowledge all those who usefully contributed to bearing down on the matters in question so that we could get to a place where Members have come to new levels of understanding about the right course to take, because it is clear that opinion has varied, even in the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Having said that, in the run-up to amendments being tabled and in advance of the Executive meeting last Thursday, I thought that there was an opportunity to get broad agreement on the advertising of functions. However, I was less clear about the two other matters that I mentioned. That is why I did not bring a paper to the Executive about those matters, instead bringing only one on the advertising of functions. However, I thought it useful that the two amendments were tabled and that the Assembly had the opportunity to consider and vote on all the options.</p>
<p>Mr McCann and Mr Brady tabled amendment Nos 1 to 4, which I understand will not be moved. The original intention behind the amendments was that, for offences named in schedule 1, a registration would not be endorsed where a second conviction was given within 12 months of the first. The amendment that Mr Gallagher and Mrs Bradley tabled would mean that a registration would not be endorsed if a second conviction were given within two years of the first. However, I stress that those amendments relate only to schedule 1 offences.</p>
<p>The Executive&rsquo;s position, as outlined in the Bill, is that the timeline should be three years. Without prejudice to the Executive&rsquo;s position, I was going to scope out that issue. However, there seems to be emerging consensus on the Floor that it might be appropriate for the Assembly to consider those matters further.</p>
<p>As with much legislation in the Assembly and other jurisdictions, different thresholds are always being created. The schedule to the Bill, for example, contains various thresholds for penalty points. That is appropriate, and that is why I opposed an amendment tabled by Mr McCann at Consideration Stage to treat all offences the same. His amendment proposed that all offences, whether major or minor, would be subject to the same level of penalty points. That is not a good principle of law. Offences should accumulate differential penalty points to reflect the more serious nature of some.</p>
<p>When it comes to thresholds, however, it is reasonable for the Assembly to consider whether, given the difference in penalty points for minor and major offences, there should also be different time frames within which those penalty points could be endorsed on a certificate of registration. That was a reasonable question, and it is a reasonable debate for the Assembly to have. It is the view of the Executive and, therefore, my view that the Bill is correct: a court could endorse penalty points on a certificate of registration if the same offence was committed twice within three years, and it could take into account any points accumulated over a three-year period. However, I hear what the Assembly is saying, and it is for the Assembly to decide how it wishes to proceed.</p>
<p>Amendment Nos 9 and 10 would allow a young person under 18 to be in the bar area of a sporting club until 11.00 pm, as supported by Mr McCann and Mr Brady, or until 10.00 pm, as supported by Mary Bradley and Tommy Gallagher. The existing 9.00 pm curfew applies to all licensed premises and registered clubs. Sporting clubs provide a valuable service to the community in many different ways. The Executive have their view of the Bill, but it is fair to comment on points raised by Members who contributed to the debate.</p>
<p>I confirm that the amendments tabled by Mr McCann and Mary Bradley would impact only on sporting clubs. That is an important point to understand fully. A further question was raised about the need to be consistent. It is already the case, under clubs legislation in Northern Ireland, that sporting clubs are treated differently from other clubs. Under current licensing legislation in Northern Ireland, owners of licensed premises must apply to the court for what is known as a children&rsquo;s certificate to allow minors to be in certain parts of those premises. However, the children&rsquo;s certificate provision does not apply to sporting clubs because they are already deemed to be different under the law. Therefore, there is a prima facie argument that to be consistent with that current law, which exempts sporting clubs, we should consider whether the licensing hours for sporting clubs should also have a different provision from any other licensed premises. That is a matter for the Assembly to consider. It is not a matter for me to influence one way or the other. As a member of the Executive, I cannot take a position on any of the amendments tabled by Mr McCann or Mrs Bradley. I hold to the Executive position that the appropriate time for children to be on licensed premises in sporting clubs is up to 9.00 pm and not thereafter.</p>
<p>As has been stated by various Members, amendment No 11 is a different matter entirely. The amendment to article 38 of the Registration of Clubs Order will mean that, when advertising a function, clubs must ensure that the advertisement states clearly that the function being advertised is for members only. Failure to do so will constitute an offence. I am pleased to say that, following Executive approval for such an amendment, I am happy to support that amendment.</p>
<p>During the Bill&rsquo;s legislative passage, I met the clubs&rsquo; leading representative body, the Northern Ireland Federation of Clubs, on a number of occasions. It believes that registered club membership, especially in larger sporting clubs, is spread over areas too wide to be easily reached via notices placed in the premises. The federation believes that, to maximise their fund-raising capacity, clubs should be able to notify their members of functions by advertising them in the media. There are, however, safeguards. Article 30 of the Registration of Clubs Order specifies conditions for functions in registered clubs. The policy intention is that all registered clubs should have their specific objects and their members&rsquo; interests at heart and should not operate on a commercial basis. I believe, therefore, that the legislation should not contain any unnecessary barriers to clubs&rsquo; important fund-raising activities, and I urge Members to support that amendment.</p>
<p>I want to reassure Members, in particular Mrs Anna Lo and the Chairperson of the Committee, and confirm that, further to the passage of the Bill, in the event that the new clause is accepted by the Assembly, the Department will issue guidance about the advertising of functions. The advertising of functions shall state &ldquo;for members only&rdquo;. I reassure Members that that will be included in the guidance notes issued to clubs in respect of the exercise of that matter.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s debate and at Consideration Stage, mention was made of the Civil Service club. I checked out that matter with an official from the club, who is, in fact, an official in DSD. The irony there is very rich. That official came back to me on the matter and put to me the argument that, having taken legal advice, the club was of the view that what it was doing was indeed permitted under current law. The club did not take legal advice in the past couple of weeks; it had taken legal advice prior to that.</p>

<p>I find that very interesting. Does the Minister agree that that proves the point that I was trying to make, which is that there is huge confusion in respect of the matter? Although the Civil Service club may have the resources to take legal advice, that is probably not available to many other clubs in Northern Ireland. Does he agree that that highlights the fact that there is huge confusion about what is and is not permissible and that clear guidance and a tidying-up of this law is very much required?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.5.40" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90250" speakername="Alex Attwood" time="13:45" url="">
<p>It demonstrates three things. First, it demonstrates that there may be confusion, or, secondly, it may demonstrate that, if people ask a lawyer to give them the right answer, they will get the right answer. Thirdly, it confirms that there is a need to create certainty and avoid any doubt. The new clause on the advertising of functions in clubs for club members only and the guidance that will be issued on that will create certainty and avoid doubt. It will ensure that the Civil Service club is, without any difficulty, on the right side of the law. I welcome the fact that Members have broadly endorsed that shift in the character of the Bill, and I want to acknowledge the role of Mr McCann and Mr Brady in creating the opportunity for the Executive to go in that direction.</p>
<p>I also acknowledge the comments of Mr Hamilton and his party colleague Mr Craig on the issue of whether it should be one, two or three years when it comes to endorsement of the certificate of registration. I acknowledge Ms Anna Lo&rsquo;s comments in that regard as well. Two years has the potential, in the view of the Assembly, to be more balanced, while I obviously hold to the Executive&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>I commend to the House the amendment on the advertising of functions and reiterate the view of the Executive on the other two matters. I understand why Members have tried to scope the issue of endorsement of the certificate of registration and the issue of minors being on sporting licensed premises after 9.00 pm. I commend my amendment to the House.</p>

<p>I support the amendments that I have before me. Amendment No 10 would amend article 32 of the Registration of Clubs Order 1996 to allow young people to be on sporting clubs&rsquo; licensed premises until 10.00 pm, not 9.00 pm. The young people who play for these clubs deserve the opportunity to be appreciated on club premises the same as everyone else. They are young players who need encouragement, and they will be doing that in the company of their parents and the club stewards, who are very responsible people. The amendment would mean that young people could remain on the premises of a sporting club &mdash; only a sporting club &mdash; until 10.00 pm, not 9.00 pm. I support all the amendments.</p>

<p> As I did at Consideration Stage, when a similar group of amendments was moved dealing with other licensed premises, save clubs, I apologise to the Assembly for the late introduction of amendment Nos 7 and 8. This is unusual practice but, as Members are aware, the issue of irresponsible drinks promotion became more crucial and critical during the latter part of last summer, in particular. Consequently, I was minded to do an urgent consultation on a proposal to ban irresponsible drinks promotions, with the consequence that the amendments at Consideration Stage were tabled without there being full scrutiny. Similarly, the amendments before the House today have been tabled without full scrutiny.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p>However, the amendments aim to ensure that there is the same law across the spread of licensed premises and, subsequently, that the same regulations will apply, if it is the will of the Assembly, across the range of licensed premises. Today&rsquo;s amendments are consistent with the amendments approved by the Assembly at Consideration Stage, except that these amendments apply to licensed clubs.</p>
<p>During Consideration Stage on 1 February, I introduced amendments that provided for new powers in the Licensing (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 to allow my Department to make regulations to prohibit or restrict irresponsible drinks promotions and other specified pricing promotions. The original policy intention was for that provision to be applicable to premises licensed under the 1996 Order and to clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Order 1996. That intention was clearly stated in the consultation document on irresponsible promotions, in briefings provided to the Social Development Committee and during my speech at Consideration Stage.</p>
<p>Due to timing and resource constraints, the provisions to be included in the Registration of Clubs Order 1996 could not be finalised in advance of Consideration Stage. Not wishing to delay the progress of the Bill, I stated during Consideration Stage my intention to introduce measures into the Registration of Clubs Order 1996 by way of this amendment at Further Consideration Stage. In effect, therefore, amendment Nos 7 and 8 mirror the provisions included in the Registration of Clubs Order 1996 when the House discussed the Bill on 1 February. Amendment No 7, therefore, provides a power for DSD to make regulations to prohibit or restrict irresponsible drinks promotions. It defines what is meant by a drinks promotion and specifies activities regarded as irresponsible drinks promotions. Irresponsible promotions &mdash; those that encourage recipients to consume greater amounts of alcohol than they might otherwise choose to under more normal circumstances &mdash; can lead to problems, including health problems, crime and disorder.</p>
<p>I recognise that most registered clubs are well run and their management committees would never permit irresponsible promotions. However, it is important that irresponsible promotions of alcohol are restricted or prohibited on any premises permitted to sell or supply alcohol. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for registered clubs to be permitted to hold promotions that would be illegal if held in pubs. That is the essence and intention of the amendments. I do not intend to outline what might be regarded as an irresponsible drinks promotion. That is included in the Bill as advised by the Office of the Legislative Counsel. It will fall to the Minister for Social Development, whoever he or she may be, to come before the House to table regulations to prohibit or restrict a registered club from varying the price at which intoxicating liquor is supplied on its premises during such period or hours as specified in the regulations. That includes happy hours, as amendment No 8 refers to.</p>
<p>Provision has not been made in the Registration of Clubs Order 1996 to restrict promotions where two or more alcohol products are included in a package. That provision is primarily targeted at off-sales premises, with supermarkets often selling multipacks of canned beer cheaper than water. As registered clubs are not permitted to sell alcohol for consumption off the premises, I believe that provision for that in the Registration of Clubs Order 1996 is not necessary at this time.</p>
<p>I recognise that bulk selling might present an issue for on-trade premises, which may, for example, provide five shots for &pound;5 where the price of one is &pound;3. However, I am satisfied that an activity such as that is covered by other examples of irresponsible promotions as provided for in amendment No 6. Furthermore, when making regulations, my Department will be able to modify them or extend or restrict their application and, therefore, has the facility to, if necessary, amend the list by subordinate legislation in light of experience. In line with provisions in the Licensing (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, it will be a level 5 offence for any premises to hold an irresponsible drinks promotion, and the new penalty points provisions will be amended accordingly.</p>
<p>Amendment Nos 12 and 13 are consequential. Amendment No 12 amends the table of offences with penalty points in schedule 2 to include the penalty points attributable to the offences that relate to the contravention of the regulations governing irresponsible and specified pricing promotions. Amendment No 13 amends schedule 3 to provide that the regulations governing the irresponsible promotions and specified price promotions must be approved in draft by a resolution of the Assembly before being made.</p>
<p>I will make one further comment about a matter that was referred to earlier. It is about any licensed premises that, in a previous regard in respect of advertising, may be on the wrong side of the current law, whatever it might mean. I will <strong>reiterate what I said during Consideration Stage</strong>: this week, I and Minister Ford are due to meet the Chief Constable, Matt Baggott, about licensing matters that cover the range of licensed premises, not just clubs, where allegations have been made and where there appears to be prima facie evidence of breaches of the current law. We will have that meeting if Minister Ford is available, and he may not be because of a family bereavement in England.</p>
<p>I assure Members that my officials and, no doubt, Mr Ford&rsquo;s officials, through the assistance of those in licensed premises who are working on the right side of the law, have provided to us prima facie information and had previously provided that evidence to the PSNI on what they considered to be breaches of the law around advertising &mdash; although that might not be such an issue in the future &mdash; opening hours, closing hours, events that have been run in various licensed premises, and so on. Quite a volume of information and evidence is available in that regard and, as I indicated previously, I shall bring all those matters to the attention of the Chief Constable. I shall urge upon him that, with that level of offence, the PSNI and the other regulatory authorities, including the courts, should take a view and take all necessary and reasonable measures to ensure that the law, in all aspects, is being complied with.</p>

<p> I thank the Member for that intervention. The law enables a future Minister for Social Development to bring regulations before the Assembly. The regulations will define irresponsible drinks promotions. During Consideration Stage, I spoke at some length about what may well be viewed as irresponsible drinks promotions, subject to the approval of the Assembly. I also indicated what might not be viewed as irresponsible drinks promotions, and although it is a matter of judgement and, ultimately, a matter for the Assembly to make a call on, guided by the Minister and subject to the consideration of the Committee, there will be a clear view of what is on the wrong side of being irresponsible and what is on the right side of being responsible.</p>
<p>I do not want to pre-empt the view of a future Minister on the matter that the Member referred to, but if that is a once-a-year or very rare occasion, I would be surprised if a Minister or the Assembly were minded to consider that that was on the wrong side of what is or is not an irresponsible drinks promotion. It is quite clear, however, that there are many other examples of what could be considered irresponsible, and I have no doubt that, in the fullness of time &mdash; sooner, rather than later, and, I hope, in a matter of months &mdash; a Minister will come to the Assembly to seek its endorsement to rule various promotions as being on the wrong side of the legislation, if the Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>
<p>Where there are allegations of a breach of the law, whether in pubs, clubs or other licensed premises, and, moreover, where it has been claimed that the PSNI is not fulfilling its obligations to enforce the law, I shall bring chapter and verse to the attention of the Chief Constable on Wednesday. I hope that where there is clear evidence of breaches, the police will act in a proportionate manner and will ensure that the law is upheld. I ask the House to support the amendments.</p>

<p> As I indicated during Consideration Stage, the Committee gave some consideration to irresponsible drinks promotions and how they affect alcohol-fuelled public disorder and other important social problems. The Committee took the view that the whole of the retail alcohol trade, whether on-sales or off-sales, needs to take the issue very seriously.</p>
<p>The amendments relate to irresponsible promotions in the registered club sector. I remind the House that the Committee noted evidence from the Police Service of Northern Ireland that alcohol-fuelled disorder issues were rarely associated with the registered club sector. The question then follows: why should the amendments be considered or agreed? During the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations, members considered evidence on the competitive tensions between registered clubs on the one hand and pubs and hotels on the other. Some members felt that registered clubs were unfairly and wrongly competing with pubs and hotels, while other members argued that registered clubs made a positive contribution to their communities and were concerned that clubs are struggling to survive.</p>
<p>The Bill, as amended at Consideration Stage, introduced wide-ranging powers to restrict many different kinds of alcohol promotions in licensed premises such as pubs and hotels. The amendments put forward today are designed to ensure that those kinds of promotions will be subject to an equal level of restriction in registered clubs. The Committee generally feels that the amendments are necessary to ensure that registered clubs will not have an unfair advantage over pubs and hotels.</p>
<p>As I said at Consideration Stage, it is regrettable that the regulations of the type proposed by the amendments are felt to be necessary. I call again on those few irresponsible retailers to change their ways. On behalf of the Committee, I encourage the whole licensed trade to bring forward its own code of practice, which will curb all irresponsible promotions, particularly those that may lead to public disorder.</p>
<p>As I indicated at Consideration Stage, the Committee&rsquo;s support for the amendments in question is dependent on its review of the subsequent regulations and their application to truly problematical alcohol promotions with wider social or public order consequences.</p>
<p>Moving away from making comments as Chairperson of the Committee, I welcome the comments made in the latter part of the Minister&rsquo;s introduction about his upcoming meeting with the Chief Constable. That is particularly important in the context of the Bill and the wash-up that is included because it has enlightened me, the Committee, the Minister and the whole House on some of the issues that are prevalent in the licensed sector. Evidence in the Committee&rsquo;s report includes a representative of the club sector freely acknowledging that breaches of the licensing regime happen on a very regular basis. The point is that we either have a licensing regime or we do not. The current conditions exist for very good reasons, not least to ensure that no particular advantage is given to one sector or that it does not encourage bad behaviour. Therefore, I think that that meeting is very important.</p>
<p>I do not think that anybody here is getting particularly het up about infractions that occur because of an oversight or misunderstanding about the law, but we are particularly concerned about repeat offences and breaches of the licensing laws, which are happening regularly by repeat offenders, probably in the full knowledge of what they are doing. There is an important need to stress that we value the current regime, otherwise, legislating as we have elsewhere in the Bill to have the penalty points regime is pointless. If we are going to have a penalty points system to enforce certain aspects of the law, it needs to be backed up by robust action taken by the police and the courts. Otherwise, we are legislating for fun. There is no point in us legislating if the people whose job it is to enforce the law do not take it seriously. Given some of the evidence that the Committee and the House has heard in previous stages of debate, there are questions about how seriously the current regime is being taken. Therefore, I particularly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>The second group of amendments are, effectively, just being consistent with what is happening for pubs, hotels and bars. That is to be welcomed, not least because we do not want to have any sort of distinction. An irresponsible promotion is such whether it is in a registered club or in a pub. I do not think that we can make any exceptions. We have to be very clear that if a promotion is irresponsible, we cannot have the situation in which it is permitted in one establishment but not in another. I reiterate the point about what constitutes an irresponsible promotion. Following an intervention from Mr McCann, the Minister seemed to indicate that the type of promotion that Mr McCann was talking about, where you can drink all you can for free for a day, was not irresponsible. Equally, it could be interpreted that encouraging people to drink all that they can for free because they are club members has very much been caught by the Bill. It highlights the need for the Assembly to be clear.</p>
<p>That is why the Bill is good. It gives examples of what might be considered irresponsible promotions, rather than being definitive. The Member or, indeed, his successor, in bringing forward future regulations, needs to be careful that, in trying to catch what are transparently irresponsible promotions, he does not catch others that would not be regarded by most people to be irresponsible or, certainly, were not intended to be so and were not taken up irresponsibly by individuals.</p>
<p>The big message that should come from the amendments should be the Assembly&rsquo;s encouragement of all sectors, including registered clubs, pubs and hotels, to act responsibly by their own accord. The Assembly is about to take a power to outlaw irresponsible drinks promotions. Sectors need to realise that they must act. As I said at Consideration Stage, in many respects, it would be best if the Assembly did not have to make regulations to outlaw irresponsible drinks promotions and the sectors took it upon themselves not to behave irresponsibly. The Minister or, indeed, his successor is being armed to go to the pub sector, the hotel sector and the registered club sector to tell them that the Department now has the power to outlaw irresponsible drinks promotions and that it is up to them to take it upon themselves to act voluntarily. That would be more welcome than the Assembly having to bring in regulations.</p>
<p>I am very much attracted by some examples of good behaviour, such as ongoing work by the alcohol forum in the north-west and Foyle. That is a good example of local authorities and others engaging on a voluntary basis those who sell alcohol in the community and trying to work out some of the problems that are addressed in the Bill. That approach is preferable in the longer term than simply outlawing things. It is to the Assembly&rsquo;s advantage to take that power. Hopefully, it will not need to use it and sectors will behave responsibly, but, at least, that power will exist.</p>
<p>I seek clarification from the Minister. Although I understand the situation, I believe that it may be worth putting it on record. The clubs sector is concerned about its advantage in being able to sell alcohol at lower prices due to members&rsquo; fees and having lower overheads than pubs. The Bill does not affect its ability to do that. There may be future legislation on minimum pricing that may affect it. However, the Bill does not. It is worth putting on record that the Bill does not impinge on pricing policy &mdash; at this stage, anyway &mdash; but, rather, deals with how clubs promote the sale of alcohol on their premises. With all those issues considered, I very much welcome the second group of amendments.</p>

<p> I thank the contributor to the debate on the second group of amendments. I will make one or two comments. First, I concur with the Committee Chairperson that what the licensed industry does of its own accord to positively encourage its members and licensed premises to act responsibly is important. As I said at Consideration Stage, we saw proof of that last summer, when Pubs of Ulster moved positively to deal with what was viewed to be irresponsible drinks promotions by a licensed outlet in the city of Belfast. At Consideration Stage, Mr Ramsey indicated that he was aware of what he considered to be ongoing irresponsible drinks promotions in the city of Derry, which had occurred the very week prior to the Consideration Stage debate. Therefore, although the licensed trade does intervene positively to encourage responsible practice, it remains the case that there are examples &mdash; hopefully, not many &mdash; of when the positive encouragement of the licensed trade falls on deaf ears when it comes to certain licensed premises. That is why it is very important to put in place a legal regime, as we are doing today, to mitigate the actions of those who, despite positive encouragement from their peers, continue to fall on the wrong side of the law or good practice when it comes to drinks promotions. That is why this week&rsquo;s meeting with the Chief Constable is important. Beyond the positive encouragement of the licensed trade and the legal regime that the Assembly might vote for, we need to have the right enforcement. Without the right enforcement, bad cases will go unpunished and bad practice that will have bad outcomes for the quality and welfare of people&rsquo;s lives will begin to embed itself in what will, hopefully, be a very small sector of the licensed trade.</p>
<p>Simon Hamilton also raised the issue of minimum pricing. The Minister of Health and I are very close to signing off the consultation document on minimum pricing. I hope that that consultation document will go out quickly and will receive a generally positive endorsement. I can confirm to the House that the licensed trade, its representatives and the various trade bodies, as well as some of the major commercial outlets in the North, are watching this issue closely and making firm representations about their views on minimum pricing.</p>
<p>Without anticipating the outcome of the consultation, I believe that the Assembly, a future Minister and the Executive will have to be very strong on this matter, because there is going to be a lot of pressure brought to bear. In being strong, we should try, not only to get minimum pricing over the line and be the first jurisdiction on these islands so to do, but to make sure that the minimum price is effective, not set too low, and set sufficiently high so as to ensure that a new discipline is created, especially around bulk purchases. That will ensure that the worst impact of excess alcohol and any impact of excessive alcohol are mitigated. I endorse the amendments.</p>

<p>1. asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his assessment of the recent joint statement by the First Minister and deputy First Minister, and the First Ministers and Deputy First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, which asserts that the planned cuts in capital budgets for next year will put the recovery of the economy in jeopardy.

<p>Members will be aware that the spending review revealed a major cut of 40% in our capital spending over the next four years. That will have an impact on the local economy, particularly the construction sector, which now relies heavily on contracts placed by the public sector. About 56% of employment in the construction industry now depends on public sector contracts.</p>
<p>We took a number of steps in the draft Budget. We switched &pound;252 million from current to capital spending. We also sought to supplement the resources available to the Executive through the sale of public assets, divesting ourselves of assets that we believe we no longer require. That will give us about another &pound;450 million of assets to put into capital expenditure. Hopefully, by doing that, by the end of 2014-15 we will be spending &pound;1&middot;5 billion in that year on capital projects. That is in keeping with the long-term trend of capital spending for the Executive.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister for that response. Does he agree that there is a need for additional fiscal powers to enable this Administration, and perhaps others, to better promote economic recovery and greater accountability, particularly of the banking sector? I heard representatives of the Scottish and Welsh Administrations make the point that there was a need for additional fiscal powers.</p>

<p>We have to be very careful. As we saw in the debate about corporation tax, the Treasury will be happy in some instances to give more fiscal powers to the Executive. However, that always comes at a price. Those fiscal powers will never be granted without a monetary attachment.</p>
<p>If you are granted a fiscal power, but money is taken from you so that less is available in the block grant, the overall impact could be negative. We have to look within our existing resources to see the best way to release more money. I have also been exploring with people in the construction and insurance industries other ways in which we might draw money into the Executive without impacting on the block grant.</p>

<p>The 10-year capital expenditure programme agreed by the former Prime Minister was not honoured by the coalition Government and is, I understand, going to the dispute resolution process of the Joint Ministerial Committee in London. Is the Minister optimistic about a successful outcome, and when will we know whether the Treasury will reverse the 40% cut to our capital budget?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.7.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="14:30" url="">
<p>It is not a case of reversing the 40% cut but of honouring the pledge to make capital spending available in Northern Ireland over the 10-year period. That pledge was made because we ran down our infrastructure during the Troubles, because money was diverted to spend on the security of Northern Ireland. As a result, we have been left with an infrastructure that is, in many cases, creaking and in need of repair. That is why the investment package was there.</p>
<p>We will simply be aiming for a recommitment that the &pound;18 billion that was promised over the period will be delivered. Under the current spending plans open to us, there is no way that that &pound;18 billion commitment will be met over the budgetary period.</p>
<p>We have to ensure that the Treasury and the Government stand by their commitments. My officials are discussing several issues with them. First, they are asking how they reached their figures. Secondly, they are asking how they expect us to spend &pound;4 billion in the last two years of the investment plan, which is what we would have to do to meet the &pound;18 billion target? Thirdly, they are discussing how we can ensure that the resources are spread more evenly so that we can have a proper planned investment of capital over the remaining Budget period?</p>

<p>How would the Minister respond to sections of the business community that have criticised the Executive for being too timid in transferring money from current expenditure to capital expenditure? Will he seek to avoid making a bad situation worse by blocking those Ministers who want to raid their already poor capital budgets to pay for current expenditure during the next year?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.7.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="14:30" url="">
<p>I have a lot of sympathy for the point that is being made by the business community. One of the reasons why we switched &pound;252 million from current spending to capital spending was because of the arguments that were made by the business community.</p>
<p>I listened to a programme on Sunday as I was driving down the road, and steam started coming out of my ears. Business pundits were talking about the Executive being too timid, not switching enough into capital spend, and everything else. Yet, at the same time, they were saying that we must spend more money on health, training and education. I will probably not make too many friends in the business community by saying this, but they cannot have it all ways. We have a finite budget. If they want to switch money from current spending to capital spending, sacrifices will have to be made. It is very easy for the armchair critics to sit back and say that we have been timid, but all that they suggest is spending more money, not how to relocate the existing amount of money.</p>
<p>I hope, because it was a considered decision by the Executive to switch from current to capital, and it was the right thing to do, that we hold to that decision and that Ministers will not take the easy way out and try to put some of their capital fund back into current spending. I hope that Ministers look at some of the things that they have to do in their Departments to ensure that they cut back on current spending so that we can deliver on the capital programme, which is so important in the long run to delivering a good economic infrastructure in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The Government also made a pledge, as part of the devolution resettlement, to allow access to Treasury reserves for any bid made for policing requests. As the Minister with lead responsibility for negotiations, can he update us on any progress on the &pound;200 million bid that the Chief Constable made to the Treasury?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.7.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="14:30" url="">
<p>I do not think that the &pound;200 million access to the contingency fund was ever in any doubt. Indeed, the Westminster Government made it clear that they would honour it. At one stage, they went a wee bit shaky on it and said that access to the fund would be granted only after we had looked at our own resources. The suggestion was that we would get access to the fund only once we had gone through our monitoring rounds and looked at our reduced requirements to see whether we could, within our existing budgets, meet the demands of the Chief Constable. The Treasury has since firmed up on that and made it quite clear that the &pound;200 million is available.</p>
<p>The second issue was whether or not the Chief Constable could guarantee that money and build it into his planning because of the dissident and security threat that his force was facing. The argument that the Treasury made was that the commitment was always going to be year on year, and that funding would have to be applied for annually, which would not necessarily have guaranteed that the money was spent in the best way. There have been extensive negotiations on that. My officials have been in discussion with the Treasury. We are going in the right direction, and we will be able to have not only access to it, but access in advance so that proper planning for that money and how it is spent can take place.</p>

<p>The ministerial working group, the First Minister, the deputy First Minister, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and I, on behalf of the Executive, have managed to secure from the Government the resources necessary, first, for a &pound;175 million loan and, secondly, for a &pound;25 million contribution to the mutual access fund. Of course, as the Member will know from the Budget discussions that we have had, we have already allocated &pound;25 million from our own Budget in Northern Ireland to that fund. We are also expecting a contribution of at least &pound;1 million &mdash;although I hope that it will be substantially more that that &mdash; from the Presbyterian Church, which has a responsibility in all of this, so that we can ensure that the small savers get a large proportion of their money back in the first instance.</p>
<p>The arrangements and details of the fund are being worked out by DETI. As far as repayment is concerned, a scheme will be put forward for acceptance by the savers. The &pound;175 million will have to be repaid first, because it is a loan that the Executive have taken out. Once the property starts to be sold, the savers will get their money, and the repayment to the mutual access fund will come after that. If there is any surplus, the administrator will decide how it is to be distributed.</p>

<p>From the very start, we have sought to ensure that the Executive would help those who were hurt financially as the result of the collapse of the Presbyterian Mutual Society (PMS). Had we not had devolution and the commitment from the Ministers whom I mentioned earlier, there would have been no rescue package for the Presbyterian Mutual Society savers; their money would have been long gone. Considerable resources are involved. I know the resources that my Department discussed at official and at ministerial levels. I also know about the political capital that the First Minister and the deputy First Minister expended and the tireless efforts of the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in dealing with the problem. That would not have happened had we not had devolution.</p>
<p>There are those who I think wish that we had not been successful in getting this arrangement. I am talking about the kind of whingers that we have in the TUV, who scrutinise every statement to see how they can unsettle the savers in the Presbyterian Mutual Society. I think that they would prefer for those savers to lose out so that could make some cynical political capital from that.</p>
<p>He has been talked about as the Mr Nasty of Northern Ireland politics, but he is also the Mr Grumpy and the Mr Cynical of Northern Ireland politics. Of course, we all know who we are talking about &mdash; the leader of the TUV, who leads a party with very few followers. He is looking for a platform &mdash;</p>

<p>We all hope that a sound rescue plan for the PMS savers can be put in place.

<p>The Minister is required to do the due diligence exercise, which the Department has carried out. Believe you me, given the hoops that we have had to jump through for the Treasury, it has not been an easy exercise. We said all along that this is a 10-year deal, which shows the Executive&rsquo;s commitment. However, it depends on what happens in the property market. It is not without risk, and I do not want to be accused of trying to hide the risks involved. Members will have to vote on it on the basis that there is no guarantee at the end of the period that 100% of the commitments will be realised.</p>
<p>However, that is true of any situation that relies on the sale of property that has been devalued and in which there is a 10-year period over which that value has to be recouped. Neither the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the First Minister and deputy First Minister nor I have ever tried to hide that, which is why we wanted the mutual access fund and the contribution from Westminster, which we have been able to secure.</p>

<p>There are three parts to the Executive&rsquo;s contribution. First, there is the &pound;175 million that we will raise through the RRI: that is a loan that has to be repaid, and interest will be attached to it. Secondly, there is a financial contribution of &pound;25 million from the Executive, which is contained in the Budget: that is a loan that will have to be repaid. The third element is a &pound;25 million contribution from the Treasury: that is a gift to the Northern Ireland Executive, not a loan to the Presbyterian Mutual Society. Should money be available to cover that at the end of the period, it is up to the administrator as to how it is distributed.</p>

<p>3. asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel, given the withdrawal of end-year flexibility, where the funding will come from to allow schools to access carried-over resources. (AQO 1023/11<a name="AQO1023/11" id="AQO1023/11"></a>)</p>

<p>It is important to clarify that there was never an expectation of the Executive having to make an immediate payment from the accumulated reserves saved in the schools sector. Although the Executive may have lost access to all their accumulated end-year flexibility (EYF) stock through the unilateral and punitive actions of the Treasury, that does not undermine the prudent scheme that operated in the education sector. As the Member knows, school boards of governors were encouraged to exercise their function under the local management of schools (LMS), which enabled schools to carry savings from one year to the next. It was good budget practice, and it enabled them to save for two or three years for large items of expenditure that were required and that they could not achieve in one year. Such practice can continue into the forthcoming Budget period, and we assured schools that they can do that. Indeed, we assured schools that we want them to continue to do that. If the issue had been handled differently, the concerns of schools might not have arisen in the first place.</p>

<p>It is technically feasible because, as I stated in an earlier answer, we switched &pound;252 million of our current spending into capital spending.</p>
<p>Normally, the money that the Treasury gives us for capital spending cannot be turned into current spending, but, because we voluntarily made that switch, we can switch it back if we wish. However, Ministers cannot simply do that; they must ask permission because the Budget statement makes it clear that the money has been switched into capital. If it has to be switched back, Executive approval is required.</p>
<p>Is it desirable? In an answer I gave previously to a Member, I indicated that it is not the situation that we would like to see. Only after a lot of consideration did we switch the current money into the capital purse. We did that for very good reasons, which, as far as I am concerned, still pertain. I would like that amount of money to be left intact.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree with me that, to challenge the British Treasury&rsquo;s smash-and-grab tactics, discussions with his Scottish and Welsh counterparts will assist him in ensuring that we can move forward on a joint platform?</p>

<p>I will not rise to the bait that my colleague on my left would like me to in discussing &ldquo;smash-and-grab tactics&rdquo; and everything else. I know that he is being mischievous and that he would like me to be mischievous. Most times, I would not mind indulging him, but I will not today.</p>
<p>The Member has made a very important point. He is right. Ours is not the only area to have suffered. Wales lost &pound;385 million in the raid on in-year flexibility reserves. Scotland lost considerably less than that, but, nevertheless, it lost money. All three Finance Ministers have collectively raised this with the Treasury. Only last week I signed off on a letter from all three of us to the Treasury on the issue.</p>
<p>A new scheme will be introduced in the March Budget, and that fact shows that its withdrawal was a cynical exercise. The Treasury knows that we have to have some way of carrying some money over from one year to the next; otherwise all we will do is blow the money on things that are perhaps not necessary and not good expenditure. Sometimes, towards the end of the year, a capital scheme may slip, and we need to have the flexibility to carry over that money. The Treasury knows that we need such a method. Good, prudent management of resources indicates that we need it, and that is why the Treasury will reintroduce the scheme. I suspect that the only reason that the Treasury stopped it was because it saw that there was probably &pound;800 million in the three devolved Administrations and decided to have some of it.</p>

<p>I declare an interest as a governor of Regent House Grammar School and Donaghadee Primary School. Does the Minister agree that the savings were made through the good financial stewardship of schools that were prepared to make some short-term gain in the long-term best interests of the pupils? It is vital, as has been said, that that money is guaranteed, as schools have been let down by the Conservative Party &mdash; a party that the questioner campaigned for at the last election.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.7.32" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90349" speakername="Sammy Wilson" time="14:45" url="">
<p> As I have made clear, it is important that schools have that flexibility. I have given an assurance, and people have asked how I can do it. My assurance is that not only will schools have access to the money that they have already saved, they will be able to continue to behave as they have in the past, saving up to 5% of their school&rsquo;s budget every year and carrying it over.</p>
<p>That can be done because the scheme is self-financing. Some schools will save money. Others, which have saved money, will spend their savings. By and large, over the period in which this has been operating, the amount of money that flowed in from new schools saving was offset by the schools that decided to spend what they had saved. Therefore, there has never really been a draw. In some years, there might be a small imbalance. Maybe more savings will be withdrawn than will be put in, or more will go in than go out, but that can be dealt with in the in-year monitoring rounds.</p>
<p>There is nothing for schools to fear. Even without end-year flexibility, we can do things internally in Northern Ireland. I want to get that message over to schools, because I do not want them to feel that they have to squander money at the end of the year and not adhere to the sound financial planning to which the Member referred.</p>

We discussed the implementation of the recommendations contained in the British Bankers&rsquo; Association&rsquo;s business finance task force report.

<p>We have great concerns, which I have already raised on a number of occasions with Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Finance. My two concerns are as follows: first, the recent bail out indicates that there has to be a restructuring of the Irish banks. That could mean some branches being sold or the representations of Irish banks in Northern Ireland being reduced. There will be implications for jobs, for the banking network and for competition.</p>
<p>My second concern is that, as a result of the bail out, the banks have been told that their reserves are much too low and that they have to get their balance sheets in a healthier position and get their reserve levels up. That means that any cash that comes in has to be used to build up reserves, with the result that there is less money available for lending. That will have an impact on Northern Ireland businesses.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.

<p>I have had extensive discussions, although I am not always happy with the explanations that I am given. For example, it stretches the imagination as to how one local bank can now charge 11&middot;49% over the Bank of England base rate for overdraft facilities. Out of the blue, some banks have forced people to pay huge fees to renegotiate their terms, even though they have been paying their loans or keeping their overdrafts within limits. I have never had a satisfactory explanation from the banks as to why that is being done. Some businesses are so badly down on their knees that the banks do not go after them, and I am worried that the banks go after businesses that are viable and have prospects, because they can get cash from them. The banks pursue those businesses, and the danger in doing so is they are going to damage good, viable businesses in Northern Ireland and put them in a situation in which they cannot grow or continue to operate.</p>

<p>No studies on drug treatment for motor neuron disease are under way in any of our health and social care trusts. Furthermore, health and social care research and development, which is in the division of the Public Health Agency that allocates research funding provided by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, is not currently funding any such studies.</p>
<p>Research into new treatments, including new drugs, is typically undertaken by the pharmaceutical industry or in specialised institutes and laboratories across the world. If new treatments were to become available in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) would be expected to assess them. NICE rigorously and independently assesses drugs and treatments and provides guidance to my Department on their use. That guidance is then assessed for its applicability to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer. Is his Department being proactive in co-operating and keeping abreast of developments through its counterparts in the South?

If those are approved, will the Department make them available to sufferers in the North?</p>

<p> I was not aware that those trials were ongoing specifically in a hospital in Dublin. Trials are typically ongoing in a number of hospitals and in a number of countries. However, if new treatments become available after research, they will be assessed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. It is on its recommendation that the Health Service is then able to fund particular treatments.</p>
<p>I understand Mr McKay&rsquo;s questions. It is a particularly difficult condition with a poor life expectancy. Work on the condition is ongoing. If we got the appropriate drugs that gave sufferers any anticipation of progress, I would not be slow in coming forward.</p>

<p>At the request of the trusts concerned, the interim management and support team made one-day visits to the A&amp;E departments at Altnagelvin and the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. IMAS reported the findings of each visit in a letter to the respective trusts. IMAS separately provided input to the Northern and Southern Trusts in respect of the implementation of the service reforms.</p>
<p>I understand that IMAS is also working with the Health and Social Care Board and trusts in respect of the development of mental health services. When I established the Health and Social Care Board, I gave it responsibility for all performance management and improvement across health and social care organisations. I also expect all trusts to continuously look to improve how they deliver services to patients.</p>
<p>During 2009-2010, the board worked with trusts to secure improvements in performance against set standards for waiting times in A&amp;E departments. As part of that process, additional external support for trusts was made available in the form of the IMAS team. I do not need to be advised about all that work as it is normal business and should be treated as such. I expect and require to be told of any serious issues or incidents. However, in respect of the IMAS visits, there were no unresolved issues of which I needed to be formally advised.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed answer. It cost almost &pound;10,000 for IMAS to review the Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. Does that mean that the Minister has come to the view that that was not proper? What is the position on asking the RQIA to carry out such a review, given that it has been used quite extensively in the past?</p>

<p>I think that the figure for all of the IMAS work in Northern Ireland is &pound;11,000. If I am incorrect about that, I will write to the Member. My information is that the cost of IMAS going into the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children was more like &pound;3,000, but we will not fall out over a few thousand pounds. As I say, I will write to the Member about that.</p>
<p>The IMAS recommendations are part and parcel of the work done in the Health Service to seek constant improvements and efficiencies and to benchmark against actions that are undertaken in other parts of the UK. The interim management and support service, which is available to all trusts throughout the UK, makes recommendations on a frequent basis. It looks at certain procedures and makes recommendations. It looked at the procedures in Altnagelvin hospital, for example, and decided that those were worth taking to other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I normally expect to see reports of a serious nature and those about serious incidents. That is part and parcel of the routine work done in the Health Service. The performance management and improvement sector in the Health and Social Care Board is very much about delivering efficiencies and better practice. It does not simply measure what is done but looks at ways to do things better. If it discovers a serious incident, I expect it to report that to me.</p>
<p>Routine work such as that &mdash; there are reviews ongoing all the time, such as value-for-money audits the whole way through &mdash; is normal practice. Indeed, the RQIA, which was mentioned, routinely goes into nursing and residential homes and fashions reports. If the RQIA sees something seriously adverse, I would see its report about that. That is part and parcel of what we look at in business. I spent many years in business, so I am familiar with that sort of routine performance management and improvement and with seeking productivity gains.</p>

<p>I have nothing further to add to the answer that I gave to Mr Campbell other than to advise the Member that just because something is in a paper does not mean that it is true. Just because a paper says that something is serious does not mean that it is. For example, a recent headline in a local paper stated that the A&amp;E at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children was unsafe. IMAS never said that, but that was the interpretation used. So, I think that Members need to guard against that type of headline.</p>
<p>Reports go routinely to the board, and the board meets monthly and always in public session. I report routinely to the House, as I am doing today, and to the Committee, so there is constant reporting. If reports are serious, we will, of course, bring those reports forward. I expect to be told about such reports, and, when I am not told about them, I get upset, as does the House. However, please do not assume that because something is in a newspaper it is true.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister for his reply. I am sure that he would agree that the confidence of the public is paramount to trust in the trust.

<p> I say to Lord Morrow that I cannot give him that assurance, because of what I have already said in answer to Mr Callaghan&rsquo;s question. I cannot legislate for or determine what people are liable to read in the newspapers or the comments made in the newspapers. However, I can tell the Member that, for example, we have responded to that business in the Western Trust. There were a number of issues, and I can go through them as required. There was a full review of imaging in Altnagelvin. Let me also assure him that we had a governance review. What we concluded on top of that is that there are no concerns about the quality of the professional performance of the doctors, nurses and health professionals, who all perform well.</p>
<p>As far as some of the issues are concerned, some of the headlines were disgraceful. However, there are a couple of issues.

<p> I have ordered the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority to inquire not simply into reporting at Altnagelvin but reporting throughout all the trusts to ensure that we have a uniform and consistent high standard. That should give confidence to everyone.</p>
<p>Since Ms Anderson made her comments last week, I have enquired into when patients were told. I am assured by the trust that no patient was notified of their diagnosis as late as 3 February. Indeed, all diagnoses were available. I am told that patients were advised of their late diagnosis and that there were concerns about four of those patients on 8 July 2010, in September 2010, on 14 October 2010 and in November 2010. I am very interested to know whether the Member has information to show that the information that I have been given is incorrect. That is what I was assured by the trust. Patients have a right to be told immediately, and it is important to ensure that that happened.</p>
<p>The Member is also aware that Altnagelvin had a requirement for 13 consultant radiologists and got nine. At that stage, equipment needed to be replaced, and that has since been done. There have been improvements, and, clearly, the service is where it should be now.</p>

<p> Mr Gallagher makes an important point: staff are frequently dismayed and demoralised by the frequent criticisms and comments about their performance. If someone comments on trusts or hospitals, it is the people who work in those trusts or hospitals they are talking about, and, if someone complains about a service, the people who deliver that service are being complained about. All too often as I work through complaints, I discover that they are routinely unfounded. Where those complaints stand up, we will deal with them.</p>
<p>I will repeat what has been discovered in the considerations and what I have reported: there are no concerns about the quality of professional performance. We have very good staff throughout our Health Service, and we should be proud of them. They need, deserve and merit our support, instead of what I see as constant, almost guerrilla warfare against the Health Service from some sectors, particularly some parts of the media. I regret that because it has an effect on morale.</p>
<p>Around 70% of costs in the Health Service are wages. Around 80% of the staff are female and are overwhelmingly low-paid. They do a huge job, and they do not do it for the money. They do it to provide a service. I empathise with the sentiments behind Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s remarks.</p>

<p> The south-west hospital is a major investment that I was able to announce in July 2007. It will be an acute hospital in that area that will deliver services for generations to come. There is much more to be done. The capital infrastructure of health in Northern Ireland is extremely poor. Many of our hospitals are 50 years old or older, and many of the mental health institutions that we operate in are 100 years old or older.</p>
<p>The Member will be aware that I prioritised four major capital projects: the Ulster Hospital ward block; the maternity unit at the Royal; and the Omagh local hospital and Altnagelvin radiotherapy unit in the Western Trust area. However, I need support from the House to enable me to provide adequate resources to deliver the four major capital projects that I am looking at.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat. Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire as an fhreagra sin. I thank the Minister for his answer. I am sure he is aware that speculation is doing the rounds that the accident and emergency facility at the Mater Hospital is to be downgraded as a prelude to closure. Can he reassure us on that? Has he given the Belfast Trust a directive that the accident and emergency facility should not be downgraded and should not be closed?</p>

<p>The way Mr Sheehan spoke was almost as if the accusation was that we are downgrading the A&amp;E and that the hospital was closing. That is the sort of speculation that goes around, and I think Mr Sheehan has a strong role to play in ensuring that such speculation does not take hold. I have said many times in the House that the Mater Hospital plays a key and integral role in the delivery of hospital services in Belfast. Although the recommendation in the Developing Better Services strategy is for a local hospital, I have made the point that we see it very much as part of the Belfast delivery through the Royal, City and Mater Hospitals. The Mater Hospital is the regional centre for ophthalmology for the whole of Northern Ireland. It has a theatre block that, frankly, surgery in Belfast could not survive without. The future of the Mater Hospital is absolutely assured, and I have had discussions with the authorities about that.</p>
<p>I have no plans whatsoever at the moment to close A&amp;E at the Mater. It will continue. It has around 40,000 visits a year, which is a number that we could not replicate as things stand. We can take comfort from that. As the service evolves, there will be changes. I cannot say that this, that or the other will be there for ever and a day. I am still the Minister, and I will be for a number of weeks yet, Tom Elliott permitting &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>

<p>I could not say that about any hospital in Northern Ireland, including the Royal, the City and Altnagelvin. The delivery of services is evolving all the time. We will see changes, as I have said repeatedly. If, for example, a patient has cancer, they will not go to the Royal, the main regional hospital, they will go to the City because that is where the specialism is. If, on the other hand, someone, God forbid, were to go through the windscreen of their car on the way home, they will not go to the City. The chances are that they will go to the Royal. It is about specialism as well. We have specialism in delivering services because patients do better that way. That is what achieves the best outcomes.</p>

<p> I warmly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reassurances on the Mater accident and emergency unit and the hospital at large. I remind the House that a previous Minister, Bairbre de Br&uacute;n, had major plans to diminish the Mater Hospital. Thank goodness that that was prevented by me and other Members.</p>
<p>Will the Minister consider the sharing of psychiatric services between the City Hospital and the Mater? A decision has been made to transfer, in part at least, psychiatric services to the City Hospital.</p>

<p>That decision will be very much informed by the Bamford review of mental health. The proposal is for a single acute mental health hospital for the city of Belfast. There is also a strong lobby for such a unit to be on an acute site because of the stigma associated with mental health. It should be seen in the same way as any other type of acute medicine. There is a consultation and, in due course, the report will be made public. I do not want to pre-empt it. However, with or without the acute psychiatric hospital, the Mater Hospital&rsquo;s future, as far as I can see, is assured. It has a very important role to play in the delivery of hospital services in Belfast. I see it very much as an extension of the Royal and the City complexes in Belfast and as a regional centre for ophthalmology and a number of other services and specialities.</p>

<p>Since the children&rsquo;s fund came to an end in March 2008, I have provided resources from my budget to continue to assist projects that were previously supported by the fund. Activities that contribute to the aims and objectives of my Department are being carried out. Those included four locally based Home-Start schemes: Down district; Armagh and Dungannon; Newry and Mourne; and Ards, Comber and peninsula area. I am committed to providing funding for those schemes until the end of the current financial year. As the Member knows, the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget is out for public consultation. Until it is agreed, work on the detail of my Department&rsquo;s budget cannot be finalised. That means that, at this time, I am unable to give guarantees to any groups about the availability of funding beyond March 2011.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister for his answer. The Minister will agree that Home-Start is a good example of preventative spending on an early intervention programme for vulnerable families that keeps children out of care, thereby improving their lifetime opportunities and actually saving the public purse the cost of services &mdash; potentially &pound;300,000 a child &mdash; in later life. What priority has the Minister given to such preventative spending measures in his budget?</p>

<p> Ms Purvis will be aware that I place great store by preventative spending. One of the proofs of that is, of course, the establishment of the Public Health Agency and all the work that it does, including the funding of more than 600 projects along those lines.</p>
<p>I should also say that, when the children&rsquo;s fund was abolished, all Departments had an opportunity to step in and pick up the funds that they saw as essential. As far as I know, my Department was the only one to step in, which we did in the case of Home-Start. We have funded around 25 Home-Start projects throughout Northern Ireland. Most of those are funded by money that comes from the trusts. Four of them were funded through the Department with project money, and they were told to seek alternative sources of funding by the end of March 2011. I understand that three of them &mdash; Down district, Armagh and Dungannon, and Newry and Mourne &mdash; have done that and are getting funding from the trusts. Furthermore, the trusts have assured them that they will continue to buy their services come April 2011. The fourth Home-Start scheme has still to make the step, and I am encouraging and will continue to encourage it to do so. As the only Minster who stepped in to support the type of activity that was previously provided through the children&rsquo;s fund, I feel that my record on the importance of Home-Start is clear.</p>

<p> Since the demise of the Executive programme fund for children, how are cross-cutting issues that affect many Departments being gauged effectively to ensure that benefits are shared? Does the Minister agree that gaps have arisen since the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister decided to axe Executive programme funding?</p>

<p> I agree entirely with Mr Beggs. The children&rsquo;s fund was set up by the previous Executive and carried on through the direct rule interregnum until we came back into office, at which point the abolition of the children&rsquo;s fund was one of the first things to happen. I regret that, because so many of its projects were of real value in the area of prevention. That is why my Department stepped in to support the Home-Start schemes. I regret that a number of schemes that would have provided great support for children in need have gone by the wayside.</p>

<p> Home-Start is by no means the only arm with which we approach the delivery of children&rsquo;s services. In addition, we provide children&rsquo;s services in a number of areas, particularly around family intervention and children&rsquo;s support. That is not to say that I do not value Home-Start; I do, and it has an important role to play.</p>

<p> I am delighted that you have given me the opportunity.</p>
<p>These amendments concentrate on tail docking. There was a wider debate of the issue at Consideration Stage, when the majority view was in favour of a ban, and amendments specifically relating to working dogs were accepted by the House. This is an attempt not to reopen that wider debate, although there is a range of views on tail docking, but to look at specific issues that have been raised by those involved in dog trials. I am sure that a lot of Members have received lobbying from many people involved with show dogs. These amendments try to address those concerns. There is a range of amendments, and I suppose that they are in descending order of preference.</p>
<p>Mention has been made that, in many ways, this legislation brings us into line with what has happened in respect of tail docking in England, Scotland and Wales. There is no doubt that registered breeders have seen a reduction in the numbers of those breeds that would normally have been docked. Figures from the Kennel Club show the difference in the number of registrations between 2006 and 2009-2010. Some of the more popular breeds that would normally have been docked, such as Rottweilers, Dobermanns, boxers and King Charles spaniels, have been fairly dramatically affected. For example, Rottweiler registration has gone down by just over 70%, Dobermann by 53%, King Charles spaniel by 40% and boxer by just over 37%. Indeed, some breeds that were customarily docked are in danger of extinction, with only one pinscher registered in 2009-2010.</p>
<p>There is a danger that this could be a vicious circle to a certain degree. It could drive down dog numbers because those animals are not bred, and that could lead to a situation in which the numbers are massively reduced or breeds are <strong>driven to extinction. It strikes me as being very strange</strong>: if the effect, particularly in the area of show dogs, is to drive down dog numbers because there is no market for them, it is somewhat beyond me how that can fit in with the general concept of the welfare of animals. Ultimately, it leads to a lot fewer dogs of particular breeds.</p>
<p>Concern has also been raised that this legislation will lead to economic loss for Northern Ireland. At the moment, for example, five championship shows are held at the King&rsquo;s Hall. That leads to direct income. In addition, bringing the pets in and getting them ready generates a substantial amount of income. About 37% of the entrants to those shows come from traditionally docked breeds. The secretaries who run those shows have confirmed that, should the number of entrants from docked breeds fall to the same level as on the mainland, it may become financially unviable to continue with the shows. That would lead to a large-scale reduction in income. There is also the potential that a range of native Irish breeds, such as the Glen of Imaal terrier, which is already on the endangered list, will be in danger of extinction. <strong>Consequently, amendment No 1 looks for an extension of the exemption to dogs that are for the purpose of show trials</strong>: for example, dogs that are with registered breeders. Regulations can be brought into place to cover that.</p>
<p>With amendment Nos 2 and 3, amendment No 2 is our preferred position, and if it falls, we will seek to push amendment No 3. The Bill seems to draw a distinction between a dog show at which a fee is paid and one at which it is not. That will have a major impact on dog exhibitors from Northern Ireland, Southern Ireland and Europe. Again, it is about removing tail docking as an offence. Our preferences have been indicated, particularly from an international perspective. A lot of EU countries do not have this prohibition and, consequently, it will disadvantage dog breeders here by comparison with breeders from those countries. Making this a specific criminal offence is not particularly helpful.</p>
<p>Amendment No 2 goes further than amendment No 3. Obviously, if amendment No 2 goes through, it will have a knock-on effect, as the Deputy Speaker said, on amendment Nos 3 and 4. We see a certain amount of merit in Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment. We prefer ours, because it goes further, but, in the event of our amendment being unsuccessful, we have no problem with Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
<p>The other amendments look again, depending on other events in connection with this, at the position. If we are unsuccessful in excluding this as a category, the Department should have the opportunity, as a fallback position, to look at those breeds that traditionally are involved with tail docking and bring forward regulations from a show trial point of view. That is the purpose of that amendment.</p>
<p>In the wider context, people will undoubtedly make the case for a ban on tail docking. As anyone who has gone into this issue in any detail will know, that may be a reasonable position for many dogs but does not cover all dogs. For many dogs, the least cruel thing is actually to ensure that there is docking at an early stage. A number of dogs are greatly inconvenienced and in great pain at a later stage with a fully grown tail, which they then face the amputation of. This is an opportunity for us to provide a nuance to the general position that the Assembly has established.</p>
<p>Amendment Nos 6 and 7 are largely consequential on earlier ones. Finally, amendment No 8 does not directly impact on the issue of show dogs, but it at least creates a bit of breathing space by delaying the commencement Order. Again, that is not our preferred position. Action should be taken in this legislation to look at the specific position of show dogs. However, at least a delay would allow the Department some opportunity to look at the issue again and bring forward regulations. As I understand it, the Department is not in a position to do that immediately anyway, so, effectively, this would slightly lengthen the delay. However, if we obtain what we want and get some of the earlier amendments accepted by the Assembly, amendment No 8 becomes redundant. It is very much our final issue.</p>
<p>There is a lot of emotion tied up in this issue. It is a very complex subject for anyone who looks at it. Our intention is simply to get it right and not to leave those involved in show trials in Northern Ireland at a disadvantage against anywhere <strong>else in Europe, and to ensure that we do not achieve something that we least desire</strong>: if this Bill goes through unamended, it will lead to a massive reduction in numbers for certain breeds of dog. I fail to see how the destruction or non-breeding of a range of dogs is in the broader interest of the welfare of animals. I commend the amendments to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90323" speakername="Stephen Moutray" speakeroffice="The Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development" time="15:30" url="">
<p>I advise the House that the Committee has not had the opportunity to discuss these amendments. My opposition, as Chairperson of the Committee, arises from the fact that they are contrary to the Committee&rsquo;s policies on tail docking, the showing of dogs with docked tails and the showing of dogs where the tail has had to be amputated following injury.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p>Those policies have been agreed by the Committee and, importantly, by the majority of the House following a vote on the amended clause 6 on 1 February.</p>
<p>Amendment Nos 1 and 5 are two different ways of attempting to achieve the same outcome. Amendment No 5 is consequential to amendment No 1. Those amendments seek to offer protection against offences if a dog has had all or part of its tail docked for the purposes of showing a dog and, as a consequence, to reintroduce the cosmetic docking of tails. The amendment will seek to allow the routine or cosmetic docking of a dog&rsquo;s tail for no other reason than for the showing of a dog. It is not so much a back-door attempt to allow cosmetic docking as the opening of the floodgates to the unnecessary practice of cosmetically docking a dog&rsquo;s tail.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.14" speakerid="unknown" error="No match" speakername="Members have decried the use of the term &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; as emotive. However, let us not beat about the bush" time="16:00" url="">
<p>show dogs are bred to be put on show against breed standards, among which is that the tail should be docked. However, that is not a requirement placed in the standards by the Kennel Club but rather an option that is applied by owners. Breed standards are principally about the appearance of a dog, and tail docking is about improving the appearance. The &lsquo;Oxford English Dictionary&rsquo; defines &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; as a treatment intended to improve appearance. It is cosmetic docking, pure and simple.</p>
<p>There are claims that the docking of show dogs&rsquo; tails is prophylactic or preventative in the same way as working dogs&rsquo; tails, as currently specified, can continue to be docked for welfare reasons through veterinary certification. The argument is now being made that show dogs&rsquo; tails are docked for welfare reasons, and the Bristol University report &lsquo;Risk factors for tail injuries in dogs in Great Britain&rsquo; is cited as proof. That report indicated that 36% of tail injuries were in-house and that 14&middot;4% were a result of being caught in a door. On the face of it, those are worrying statistics until one delves deeper. The statistics are based on the number of reported tail-related injuries, which totalled 281; that is 281 out of a population of some 138,000 dogs surveyed &mdash; 0&middot;23%. That equates to 101 dogs out of 138,000-odd that have had in-house injuries. When further information was sought, it was found that 30 cases out of a sample size of 138,212 required amputation.</p>
<p>I in no way wish to trivialise the pain that those dogs suffer, and I have no doubt that reputable owners and breeders value highly their animals&rsquo; welfare. However, let us not create a smokescreen by saying that welfare is the justification for allowing routine docking of a tail. It is not. Many in-house injuries are the result of human interventions, such as closing a door on the tail. That does not justify the docking of a tail as distinct from the docking of working dogs&rsquo; tails, which is permitted on the basis of the natural conditions in which it works. Indeed, in some circumstances, the pest that is being hunted can cause the damage.</p>
<p>The overriding objective for showing a dog is its appearance, and the removal of part or all of the tail to adhere to a breed specification results in the cosmetic docking of tails. It is not appropriate to alter the appearance of a dog to achieve a cosmetic outcome. The Kennel Club and show dog owners state that it should be left to them to take the decision to dock or not. In other words, they support the elective docking of the tail. That is further proof that welfare is not the priority in the decision, unlike in the case of working dogs, but that the appearance of the dog is paramount.</p>

<p>If the net effect of the passing of the current legislation is a massive reduction in the number of dogs, presumably the welfare of a dead dog is not particularly good in that regard. If the dog does not exist in the first place, that would surely actually go to the welfare of it. It is not just a cosmetic issue.</p>

<p>I thank the Member for his intervention; I will cover that as I continue. The Committee is totally opposed to cosmetic docking, and I was delighted that the House indicated at Consideration Stage that it too was opposed to it.</p>
<p>I now turn to the second and third amendments. The former seeks to remove subsections 12 to 18 from clause 6, and the latter seeks to remove subsections 12 to 14. The issue is whether it would be an offence to show a dog with a docked tail. As previously explained to the House at Consideration Stage, the Bill allows for dogs to be shown if the tail is docked before the ban is enacted. It will be an offence to show a dog if its tail is docked after the ban is introduced. The Committee has been very clear when it has said that, if you accept that the cosmetic docking of tails is wrong, it is also wrong to allow the continuation of events that perpetuate that practice. Those two amendments seek to do that, as they seek to allow dogs with docked tails to continue to be shown despite the removal of a docked tail as a requirement by the Kennel Club.</p>
<p>In addition, amendment No 3 would remove the vitally important offence of providing false information to a veterinary surgeon in respect of certification. As I indicated, the Committee&rsquo;s position is that you cannot ban the cosmetic docking of dogs&rsquo; tails yet allow the showing of dogs that have been put through that unnecessary elective practice. The Committee is content that working dogs with legally docked tails can continue to demonstrate their working ability at dog shows, as the primary objective for docking the tail is on welfare grounds.</p>

<p> In the early part of the Member&rsquo;s statement, he suggested that the Committee has not had the opportunity to discuss the amendments, so how can he, as Chairperson of the Committee, now say that the Committee has a view on various aspects? The Committee has not had an opportunity to discuss the amendments, which are a change from the position that was agreed in the House.</p>

<p> The Member will be well aware that there were opportunities to put amendments before this point, and the Bill has to move on.</p>
<p>As indicated, the Committee supported and indeed strengthened subsections 12 and 14 of clause 6 in Committee during Consideration Stage. The proposed amendments seek to undo what has been agreed, and the Committee stands opposed to them.</p>
<p>Amendment No 4, which is in the name of Mr Beggs, seeks to allow the showing of a dog whose tail has been damaged and has, unfortunately, had to be amputated. That was also discussed previously in Committee, and the Committee agreed that it should continue to be an offence. I make it clear that the overwhelming majority of breeders and owners value their dogs, and, as has been pointed out by other Members, they often spend more money on the dogs than on themselves. However, it is unfortunate that there are a few in society who would deliberately set two dogs on each other to make a profit, and I have no doubt that there are those who would deliberately damage a dog&rsquo;s tail so that it would be surgically removed, in order to make a profit.</p>
<p>Let us be clear: the proposed amendment is not limited to mature dogs but incorporates all ages of a dog from a newborn puppy upwards. How much more likely will be instances of damage to a pup&rsquo;s tail with the excuse that it was the bitch that damaged it when the reality is that it was damaged deliberately to secure a higher profit? The amendment will create a loophole that will allow that heinous act to be carried out. The Committee did not wish to see that loophole created. Our priority is to protect the dog from the few who would undertake those actions. Therefore, I hope that the House will agree with the Committee and oppose this amendment.</p>

<p> No, I have already given way twice. Members will all have an opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>Amendment No 6 seeks to remove the showing of a dog with a docked tail as an offence. Hopefully, the House will agree with the Committee position that cosmetic docking is wrong and that the showing of dogs with cosmetically docked tails only perpetuates that practice. The Committee believes strongly that the practice needs to be discouraged and is content that an offence be created. It is accepted in England and Wales that the showing of dogs with docked tails promotes the cosmetic docking of dogs&rsquo; tails.</p>

<p>The position that I have given is the Committee&rsquo;s latest position.</p>
<p>The final two amendments seek to delay the commencement of the tail-docking clause until such times as the Department brings subordinate legislation for a period of two years after Royal Assent. The Committee sought to defer the commencement of clause 45 regarding enforcement of the Bill by local government, and the Department has agreed to that. That has an impact on clause 6, as the penalty offences created in it would be enforced by dog wardens. That action was taken for positive reasons; namely, to allow for further discussions on the Bill&rsquo;s impact on local government. The Committee agreed a period of a year to undertake those discussions, conscious that the issues needed to be addressed as soon as possible to allow for the introduction of all parts of the Bill.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments are negative. They seek to delay the introduction of necessary and timely welfare legislation aimed at protecting dogs. They could lead to further welfare problems, because, if the House agrees to a statutory start date, it will create a demand for dogs with docked tails, with only a few being successful enough to be shown. That will create a surplus of dogs in Northern Ireland that either will have to be rehomed or will end up as strays, impounded and subsequently euthanised. There is no concern for welfare; rather, there is support for the promotion of docked tails at shows. The Committee has an assurance from the Minister to defer and is content with that arrangement.</p>
<p>Accusations have been made that the Committee has not listened to the owners of show dogs, and they feel that they have been unrepresented during Committee Stage. On 2 March 2010, the Committee took evidence from Show Dogs Ireland. Although the organisation came to talk about the principles of the Dogs (Amendment) Bill, it gave an extensive presentation on tail docking and the showing of dogs. The Committee also received written evidence from the Council of Docked Breeds, and that evidence is contained in the report. Members will undoubtedly be aware of the content of that submission. Therefore, the Committee is content that appropriate representation has been made to and received by the Committee.</p>
<p>Docking the tails of farmers&rsquo; dogs, which are used for herding or driving cattle and sheep, began early in Georgian times in England. The practice exempted the owner from a tax levied on working dogs with tails. Many other types of dogs were also docked to avoid the luxury tax. Even when the tax was repealed, the tradition of docking continued, and it does so today. However, community standards change, and legislation must reflect that. The practice of docking dogs&rsquo; tails was acceptable and known as routine, elective or cosmetic, but it is no longer acceptable. After many hours of debate, the Committee accepted that. The House accepted it on 1 February, which is barely two weeks ago. The Committee&rsquo;s position on its policies on the matter has not changed. It hopes that the House maintains its position again and opposes the amendments. I also repeat the Committee&rsquo;s established position as contained in its report.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.26" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90263" speakername="Willie Clarke" time="16:00" url="">
<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. First, I agree with the Committee Chairperson. We discussed many aspects of the Bill on 1 February, including the Committee&rsquo;s amendment coming to the House. Overall, there is support for the amendment, but I did not agree with it from the outset. I would have preferred the more focused amendment that the Minister was proposing, because I saw a greater ability in it to enforce the legislation. The wider the debate becomes, the more groups are sought to be included, and the more reasons and opportunities are sought to allow more dogs&rsquo; tails to be docked, the more it does a disservice to the House to continually look for ways to bring that forward.</p>
<p>One main aspect of the legislation is to protect non-farm animals and to prevent cruelty. That is what we are discussing today. We accept that exemptions have to be made for a number of working breeds, such as pointer retrievers, and that such calls were also made for terriers, spaniels and combined breeds. There is an understanding that there is real concern that worse damage can be done to a dog&rsquo;s tail through its work in undergrowth. That was clear in evidence to the Committee. A lot of lobbying and discussion has taken place on cosmetic docking, which is an emotive phrase. I agree with the Chairperson and his dictionary reference that it is docking that is carried out to improve appearance. It is not carried out on welfare grounds. It is carried out purely for appearance. Therefore, from that point of view, there is no way that I will support any of the amendments.</p>
<p>The Chairperson is correct to say that the Committee looked at ways to close loopholes that would allow dogs with docked tails to be shown, as has happened across the water; for example, when car parking fees were charged as a way to get round the legislation. Some people who argued for that now seek loopholes that would allow that to happen. I speak as a member of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development. We discussed that issue at length over many weeks. It seemed like groundhog day. We went over the issue continually. Not once did I hear anyone in the Committee call for cosmetic tail docking. That never happened. People can look at the records. All Members are on <strong>record as saying that the matter is not about cosmetic tail docking</strong>: it is about benefitting the welfare of working dogs and allowing them to work. I heard that continually.</p>
<p>At the beginning, when I came to the matter, I was opposed to tail docking. After I heard the evidence, I was persuaded that there are some well-founded reasons for it. However, we simply cannot change our position. All parties were engaged at Committee Stage. Not once did I hear them call for exemptions for cosmetic tail docking. I put that on record. Some material was distributed &mdash;</p>

<p>The Member may call it what he wants. At the end of the day, you cannot say that there should be exemptions for working dogs. Nobody has given me a clear rationale for allowing more dogs to have their tails amputated on medical grounds. That is what we are talking about. It causes pain. The matter is about animal welfare. The Member says that there is no reference to it. Throughout Committee Stage, it was referenced continually that exemptions were necessary purely on welfare grounds.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. We are discussing animal welfare, and it has been pointed out that it is not part of this legislation. Hunting is not part of this legislation. The Bill that is before us today should be discussed purely on welfare grounds.</p>
<p>I am conscious of time, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know that you want to get through this as quickly as possible. Members are talking about what is acceptable and about how we can allow docked dogs to be shown. That is basically what the Bill is about. It is about how we can extend the legislation to allow docked dogs to be shown. Under the current proposals, dogs that have had their tails docked before the new legislation comes into statute will be allowed to be shown. Therefore, that number of dogs will be allowed to be shown for their lifetime.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.35" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90264" speakername="Trevor Clarke" time="16:15" url="">
<p>Given that those dogs will be permitted to be shown for their lifetime, will the Member take Mr Weir&rsquo;s point that the numbers of a breed will continue to decline, if, for welfare reasons, people decide not to continue to breed that animal. Once those animals reach a certain age and are no longer shown, there will be no more of those breeds brought to shows, if people stop breeding them. That will bring about a decline in numbers.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.36" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90263" speakername="Willie Clarke" time="16:15" url="">
<p>I do not think that there will be a decline in numbers. The dog-showing fraternity will have a sizeable time in which to prepare and look at their shows in a different manner. Why not have breeds of dogs with tails on show? In any case, all dogs on show would have tails. I do not see the reason for cosmetic tail docking. Nobody has stated that reason.</p>
<p>Members say that what happens should continue to happen. Slavery used to exist until some people decided that it was wrong and that legislation was required to end it. That is what we are supposed to do here. We are here to improve legislation, improve the welfare of animals and prevent cruelty.</p>

<p>I hate to return to the point, but the Member is now making a comparison between tail docking and slavery. However, he will not give the House any reason why he draws a distinction between tail docking and hare coursing. I invite the Member to explain why his views on animal welfare differ when he is talking about the Bill and tail docking from when he is talking about hare coursing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.38" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90263" speakername="Willie Clarke" time="16:15" url="">
<p>I draw the comparison to show that good legislation, when needed, has to be made, even if a number of people think that it is unpopular. I am sure that Francie Molloy will explain the distinction when he makes his contribution, if the Deputy Speaker permits him.</p>

<p>Again, I advise the Member to discuss the amendments before us, which are about the docking of tails. I am not sure whether a hare has a tail; it is questionable. Will you continue, please, Mr Clarke, and we will try to get through this. I do not mind about the Members who were not on the Committee. That is what democracy is about &mdash; they can put down amendments. However, there were people on the Committee who voted on the Committee report and never raised any concerns, but they come to the House now to say that they have major concerns, which were not expressed before.</p>

<p> I assume that the Member is referring to me. Is it not a defence that some people who wanted to give evidence had their meetings cancelled on more than one occasion and were never given the opportunity to come to the Committee to defend their position in relation to having dogs&rsquo; tails docked?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.42" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90263" speakername="Willie Clarke" time="16:15" url="">
<p>The running order of the Committee is not my responsibility. However, everybody had an opportunity through the public adverts to make written submissions on their position. That was clearly done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.43" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90264" speakername="Trevor Clarke" time="16:15" url="">
<p>Will the Member not accept that I am not making any excuse for the general public about making representation to the Committee on the Bill? My point is that there was a group of people who wished to make a presentation on the legislation, but were refused the opportunity. They were offered an opportunity, but the meeting was cancelled on no fewer than two occasions, thus preventing them from coming to give evidence to the Committee to put their case forward so that members could come to their own conclusions about what they had to say.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.44" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90263" speakername="Willie Clarke" time="16:15" url="">
<p>I agree that there were groups of people who wanted to give information and, for one reason or another, the Committee could not fulfil that wish. On two occasions, members did not turn up to the meeting. When the meeting was organised, we could not get a quorum to attend it. That gives some insight into how seriously certain members were taking the issue; they would not go to the meeting. I think that the meeting in Ballymena was to meet the Dogs Trust and to look at microchipping, but that is straying into another piece of legislation. I will stay focused.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there was ample opportunity, except for having a public hearing, to provide the information to the Committee. At Committee Stage, all members knew about showing dogs. They were au fait with that aspect of the legislation and the impact that it would have on that fraternity.</p>

<p>How would the Committee have had the opportunity to be au fait with everything, given &mdash; you have not answered the question &mdash; that they were never given the opportunity to listen to the evidence provided by those groups and to ask questions on it? It also seems strange that those groups came from one side of the argument. We got more than one opportunity to hear evidence from those in favour of docking, but we did not get to hear from the same number of people against tail docking.</p>

<p>I do not agree with that. Again, it is not my position to organise the meetings. If, when that meeting in Ballymena was postponed, members had raised serious concerns at that time and said that they wanted to hear that oral evidence, they should have called for a meeting of the Committee to put proceedings in place.</p>

<p>Does the Member accept that, last week, I asked for the Committee to sit to hear that evidence, even if it was late? I was told that it was set in stone that this debate had to go on today. Nothing is set in stone if we are talking about the democratic rights of people. We should be in a situation where the evidence could have been taken by the Committee, even at a later stage, so that amendments could be made by the Committee for today&rsquo;s debate or for a debate later in the month. There is no reason why it had to be held today. Last week, the Committee would not facilitate the opportunity for the dog show people and others to give evidence that would have influenced amendments that could have come forward.</p>

<p>No. I am going to finish this point first.</p>
<p>We are limited in taking evidence. We had a Committee meeting last Tuesday. Members then wanted people to have an opportunity to present information orally before Thursday morning, when amendments had to be tabled. It was a very limited window of opportunity. We had Tuesday afternoon. We would have had to contact people who live in Spain and get them across to Ireland to give their evidence on the Wednesday, assuming that members would even have the time to get to that meeting to have a quorum. There are limits to what can be done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.53" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90264" speakername="Trevor Clarke" time="16:30" url="">
<p>I accept that we have a very tight time frame as we come near to the end of this mandate. It is right and proper that we try to push as much legislation through before we get to that stage. As the Member&rsquo;s colleague Mr Molloy said, however, there was a possible opportunity to take evidence from that group, although I accept that it would have been at very short notice. However, would it not have been a useful exercise to give that organisation the opportunity, even on Wednesday? That would still have given the Committee ample time to table an amendment by 9.30 on Thursday morning. So, although we might have given that organisation short notice to come here by Wednesday, we would have given it an opportunity to make its case heard.</p>

<p> I will briefly respond to that. Those people were given the opportunity to come on the Wednesday, but that was just not possible to arrange. So, we will put that one to bed.</p>
<p>After lengthy discussions, it was agreed that there would be exemptions. I think that that is what was stated. I know that the whole Committee was opposed to cosmetic tail docking. What is now happening in the Chamber is a smokescreen to cover the opening-up of that to other breeds. I am opposed to that as the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson and from a personal point of view. I will leave it at that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.56" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90350" speakername="Roy Beggs" time="16:30" url="">
<p>Amendment No 4 deals with an issue on which I was lobbied by a dog owner who greatly enjoys showing her prize animal. She expressed concern that, should a show dog have an accident or infection requiring treatment that means shortening its tail, the owner would potentially be prevented from showing their dog, even if the tail was shortened by a short amount. Given the degree to which that owner values her outings with the show fraternity, I feel that the issue is worthy of a second look. I mentioned at Consideration Stage that the issue was starting to arise and that I would consider it at this stage.</p>
<p>Amendment No 4 simply adds another option to clause 6 that would not stop an owner from showing a dog. The first part of the amendment at paragraph (a) is essentially what is in the Bill. The addition is (14)(b), which states that there would be an exemption if:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;the dog&rsquo;s tail was removed in the circumstances described in subsection (3)(a) or (b)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The exemptions in clause 6 (3)(a) and 6 (3)(b) apply if a tail has been shortened:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;(a) by a veterinary surgeon for the purpose of medical treatment; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) in order to prevent or remove an immediate danger to the life of the dog in circumstances where it is not reasonably practicable to have the tail, or, as the case may be, any part of the tail, removed by a veterinary surgeon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, we are talking about very restricted circumstances in which the exemption would apply.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.57" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90264" speakername="Trevor Clarke" time="16:30" url="">
<p>My colleagues have suggested supporting the Member&rsquo;s amendment if our amendments do not make it through, and I will do that. When the Member was being lobbied by the dog owner, did he get any indication of how many dogs might be affected by amputation of their tail?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.58" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90350" speakername="Roy Beggs" time="16:30" url="">
<p>If I had been given more time to put this over, the Member would have heard me say that my information is that the exemption would affect a relatively small number of dogs. The Kennel Club, in its monthly gazette, lists dogs in its shows that may have had such an injury. That list may only number nine animals, of all breeds, in a month throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In evidence given to the Committee on 22 June 2010 with departmental officials, Mr Irwin, one of the Member&rsquo;s colleagues, asked:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Does that mean that dogs that have their tails docked because of injury cannot be entered for a show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The departmental official replied:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;You are talking about an exemption that will apply on very few occasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, clearly the officials believe that it would apply on very few occasions, which is supported by the number of exemptions granted by the Kennel Club at its shows. So, to be clear, the exemption will only be applied in exceptional circumstances where a difficult judgement has to be made.</p>
<p>We need to be careful that we do not place the owner or the vet in an impossible situation. The owner of a dog with a damaged tail might greatly value showing, so there is a potential for this to start affecting decisions about the treatment process. An owner may want their dog to have the best treatment, but they may also not want to risk losing part of the dog&rsquo;s tail and not being able to show the dog. So, an owner may express a preference to try to save the whole tail when the veterinary advice is that the tail should be shortened in the best welfare interests of the dog. I am concerned that there could be a tension between the owner and the vet there.</p>

<p>I will just finish this point.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I did not table the amendment at Committee Stage is that I recognise that there is a danger that unscrupulous dog owners could deliberately damage their dogs&rsquo; tails. However, the experience of the Kennel Club in England and Wales is that the exemption is not being abused.</p>
<p>I also look positively at most dog owners. I do not think that the dog-owning fraternity would deliberately damage their animals&rsquo; tails in order to shorten them. The risk of that happening is very low, and the figures back that up. One has to make a judgement on all of this. To get balance on the subject, I favour the dog owners, because the evidence is that there have not been large numbers of dogs gaining exemptions to show in England and Wales as a result of medical treatment. Therefore, we too should not preclude any dog that has suffered, be that through infection or an injury, and its owner from a show that is greatly valued by both of them.</p>
<p>I hope that Members understand my reasoning.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.61" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90321" speakername="Francie Molloy" time="16:30" url="">
<p>I welcome the Member&rsquo;s late conversion. Unfortunately, in Committee he did not move in this way. When I tried to say that dogs that are exempt should be allowed to be shown, because working dogs can also be shown, he was not supportive. In fact, the Member put forward proposals on parking charges at shows to cover what he called a loophole. He wanted the legislation to be even stronger than the Department wanted it to be. I cannot understand why the Member has tabled an amendment that would bring the Bill back to a different stage. Is he just responding to lobbying, or does he actually believe what he is saying?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.62" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90350" speakername="Roy Beggs" time="16:30" url="">
<p>The Member will recall that the Committee received evidence from the dog-showing fraternity that it uses a loophole in the legislation to show dogs that have had their tail docked. If we knowingly introduce legislation that has loopholes that can be abused, we will create bad legislation. For that reason, the Committee and I sought to close those loopholes. However, as I stated, I subsequently received information that an amendment for dogs that had their tail docked as a result of medical treatment was needed. I also received information that the number of dogs that gain an exemption for that in England and Wales is low.</p>
<p>When the amendment was discussed in Committee, I was concerned that it may have opened up the floodgates and a potential for abuse. Therefore, I did not agree with it. However, having received further information and lobbying on the issue, I found that, on balance, there is a relatively low risk and there may be a higher welfare risk to dogs in not tabling amendment No 4. For that reason, I tabled it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.63" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90264" speakername="Trevor Clarke" time="16:30" url="">
<p>The Member said that there might be a higher welfare risk to dogs if we do not accept his amendment, and, to a certain degree, I can accept that. However, there is an even greater risk if the amendments tabled by the DUP are not accepted. Pups are taken when they are five days old and given prophylactic amputations or whatever people want to call them as a preventative measure. The word &ldquo;prophylactic&rdquo; comes from the Greek for &ldquo;advanced guard&rdquo;, and it means a preventative measure or something that fends off diseases or other unwanted consequences. Does the Member accept that a prophylactic procedure could safeguard those pups even further and prevent them having to go through amputation?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.64" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90350" speakername="Roy Beggs" time="16:30" url="">
<p>The amendments that have been tabled in the name of Peter Weir and his colleagues give a range of options with different effects. However, I have exposed the thinking behind them. Amendment No 1 will amend clause 6. Clause 6(3) states:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;A person does not commit an offence &hellip; if the whole or any part of a dog&rsquo;s tail is removed -</p>
<p class="indent">(a) by a veterinary surgeon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Earlier, I outlined the other exceptional circumstances covered by that clause, so that, if a dog is in danger, its tail can be removed by some other treatment or by someone who is not a veterinary surgeon. Amendment No 1 will amend clause 6 by adding:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;or;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) for the purposes of showing a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Members said that the issue is not about appearance, yet amendment No 1 specifically allows docking so that a dog can be shown. It would allow people who wanted to dock their dog&rsquo;s tail a way to do so, simply by saying that they wanted to show it. If that is not removing a dog&rsquo;s tail for cosmetic purposes, I do not know what is.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.65" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90264" speakername="Trevor Clarke" time="16:30" url="">
<p>I remind the Member what I said earlier: &ldquo;prophylactic&rdquo; means &ldquo;an advanced guard&rdquo;.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.66" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90350" speakername="Roy Beggs" time="16:30" url="">
<p>Amendment No 1 is not about an advanced guard; it is about allowing people to dock a dog&rsquo;s tail if it is being shown. Any Member who votes for that amendment is in favour of allowing a dog&rsquo;s tail to be removed by people who want to show their dog without a tail. That is what the law will say if amendment No 1 is accepted, and I ask Members to consider that carefully. It will negate many of the animal welfare provisions in the Bill. How on earth can medical treatment with a veterinary surgeon or emergency treatment that could affect the life of a dog be compared with the DUP amendment to allow tail docking for dogs that are shown? Whoever thought up that amendment has really shown their hand, because it is about showing dogs to maintain the look of a dog. The legislation would give effect to that if the amendment is accepted, and I am opposed to it.</p>
<p>The other amendments gradually come down the scale, essentially moving a decision further down the pipeline. Some of the other amendments pass the decision to the Minister at a future occasion, so that we will have to come back here and make the decision. The final amendment simply puts it off for two years. Essentially, we either avoid making the decision, or we delay the decision.</p>
<p>I remind Members what happened during Consideration Stage. It was made clear that any dog that had been docked prior to the introduction of the legislation would not be affected and could continue to be shown. We are talking about the showing of dogs after the introduction of the legislation and what would happen should their tail be docked. There will be a run-in period. The legislation forces people to make a decision on when they decide to dock their dogs.</p>
<p>We must bear in mind the fact that we have widened greatly the original legislation and included many breeds of working dog that have a higher risk of damaging their tail because they are working dogs. There are risks in having widened the legislation, as the decision to dock a tail must be taken very early on in the life of a dog. It must be decided early on whether the dog will be a working dog or not. If the amendments, particularly amendment No 1, were to go through, the owner of a young pup would be able to make an easy decision to dock its tail and be able to show the dog as well as work it. On animal welfare grounds, the Committee made a strong argument for including working dogs in those that could be docked. However, there is the danger of opening that up to abuse. Someone could say that they are going to work a dog but, essentially, might just end up showing the dog because they like the look of a docked tail, rather than having it done on animal welfare grounds. For that reason, I propose amendment No 4 and oppose the other amendments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.67" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90264" speakername="Trevor Clarke" time="16:45" url="">
<p>The Member again referred to the look of a dog. If a dog is one of the working breeds that are exempt, as has been discussed, surely, as the legislation stands and regardless of whether the Member&rsquo;s amendment is made, that dog cannot be used for show purposes. Someone who owns a gun dog cannot show that dog.</p>

<p>If someone decides that their dog will be a working dog, they will be able to show it in a working environment. There are criteria in the legislation allowing for that dog to be used for demonstrating purposes. However, if a dog&rsquo;s owner wanted it to be shown for cosmetic purposes, for its visual image, I agree that that would not be allowed. On animal welfare grounds, if someone wishes to breed dogs for showing purposes, they may well decide not to work the dog and keep it for showing purposes. In fact, a member of the dog fraternity told me that on frequent occasions there may be different bloodlines. There is the beautiful dog that is the image of what the breed should look like, and there is the dog that can retrieve the game and do the work. It is very rare that the categories flow together. I ask Members to support amendment No 4.</p>

<p>I declare an interest as an honorary member of the British Veterinary Association Northern Ireland. I am disappointed that anyone should, at this late stage, make an attempt to undo the very complementary work that the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, the Minister and her officials have put into the Welfare of Animals Bill over a long and testing period. It has been going on for quite a while, and a lot of work has been done. Thankfully, there were never any real political divisions during the debates. From time to time, some Committee members expressed personal concerns on specific issues, but most times reluctant acceptances were the order of the day.</p>
<p>We have reached this point in the Bill&rsquo;s progress because of the amicable agreement in the Agriculture Committee, which is made up of representatives of the DUP, SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist Party. The DUP amendments surprised me a little. We were guided through the debates on the Bill by two members who, in my view, did an excellent job: the former Chairman, Ian Paisley Jnr, and, latterly, Stephen Moutray, whom I must congratulate on his earlier presentation, which represents the Committee&rsquo;s view or certainly my understanding of it.</p>
<p>Ian Paisley Jnr and Stephen Moutray could not be faulted in their respective roles, and they helped get the Bill to this stage. Other DUP members &mdash; Jim Shannon, William Irwin and, in recent times, Simpson Gibson &mdash; contributed to the Committee&rsquo;s efforts, and I have no recollection of any of them seeking to implement the suggestions now included in the amendments. I am a little surprised and baffled as to why my Committee colleague Trevor Clarke has lent his name to the amendments. I predict that, unless the DUP Chief Whip imposes a whip on the vote &mdash;</p>

<p>I will not. I will do as the Speaker does. I will look at the Hansard report in the morning and see what Mr Trevor Clarke had to say, and I will get back to him. All the amendments will be defeated heavily unless the DUP Chief Whip uses the whip.</p>
<p>As the SDLP representative on the Committee, I wish to express my opposition to the eight amendments on the Marshalled List, and I will make brief comments on each of them.</p>
<p>Amendment No 1 takes us right back to square one. As we have heard from other Members, if the amendment is successful, there would be nothing to prevent any dog owner taking his or her dog to the vet to have its tail docked on the pretence that he or she plans at some time in the future to enter the animal in dog shows. Therefore, I oppose that amendment.</p>
<p>I oppose amendment No 2, which would leave out six key subsections of clause 6, subsections (12) to (18). It more or less seeks to rubbish a lot of time spent in lengthy discussions and the conclusions reached by the Committee. That valuable work should not be sidelined on a mere whim.</p>
<p>I oppose amendment No 3, through which the Member seems to take a second bite of the cherry. As I stated previously, the SDLP is opposed to the exclusion of subsections (12) to (18) of clause 6. That includes subsections (12), (13) and (14), referred to in amendment No 3.</p>
<p>As to amendment No 4, I accept that Mr Beggs has only recently joined the Committee, and therefore I do not expect him to be fully au fait with all that took place during the Committee debates on the issue. I cannot support amendment No 4, because, if agreed, as he more or less said himself, it would create a loophole that would allow an unscrupulous owner to deliberately damage a dog&rsquo;s tail. I have no doubt that, if this amendment succeeds &mdash;</p>

<p>I will not give way. I heard enough earlier.</p>
<p>If amendment No 4 succeeds, some unscrupulous owners will be the first to take advantage of the loophole. That is a given, so I am opposed to that amendment as well.</p>
<p>Amendment No 5 has to be opposed simply because it reverses practically everything that has gone before, not only in Committee but everything presented to the full Assembly and agreed to by the full Assembly, as we heard from the Chairman in this very Building on 1 February. I will not refer to the other amendments.</p>

<p>I am not a member of the Committee, but I have followed the debate with some interest. At least Mr Beggs has become a member recently.</p>
<p>Because I spoke in the last debate, I have now had the full fury of the dog breeders and dog show fraternity heaped on my shoulders over the past couple of weeks. I listened with great interest to the previous debate and to what has been said today. I have read all the submissions and listened to phone calls from people involved and interested in the subject, and I have not heard one thing that makes me want to change my mind about the way the Alliance Party voted the last time, which was in favour of amendment No 2.</p>
<p>As other Members have said, amendment No 1 is nothing more than an attempt to allow the dog show fraternity to continue to dock their dogs&rsquo; tails. I hear the word &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; used. The word does not matter much. &ldquo;Cosmetic&rdquo; means appearance. Why else would people who want to show dogs dock their dogs&rsquo; tails unless it is a requirement of the dog show and one that is based on appearance? I wonder how far I will get before Mr Clarke intervenes. It is just a question of appearances or beauty.</p>

<p>The Member has read the amendments. Can the Member see where the word &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; is used? I asked Mr Willie Clarke that question earlier. As I said, prophylactic docking is used to prevent unwanted diseases or consequences.</p>

<p>I do not need to find the word &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; to understand what this is about. It is about appearance. I wonder how many dog owners have dogs that are neither show dogs nor working dogs. I would have thought that the vast majority of dogs in this country do not belong in either category. I very much doubt that many of them have their tail docked except for the reason of occasional injury. I do not follow the argument in any way, except to say that it is purely to do with the narrow interests of dog show operators and people who show dogs, who want to keep things they way they are. I appreciate that it is a tradition and that things have been done in a certain way for many years, but that does not make it right. Sometimes we have to change things, and we have an opportunity to do that.</p>

<p>Hold on. I am sorry; was that an attempt at an intervention?</p>
<p>Kieran McCarthy is our spokesperson on these matters, but he has gone AWOL again today. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.</span>] I have not read the Committee minutes, nor do I know what he said in Committee. I do not think that he is trying to avoid the issue, but it has been left to me, and I am telling the House what the opinion of the Alliance Party Assembly group is. It is absolutely clear: we will oppose all the amendments, except for amendment No 4, as we have some sympathy for Mr Beggs&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>I hear the argument that a consequence of the Bill will be a massive reduction in the breeding of certain types of dog. Are all the Dobermanns in this country kept purely for showing? Does none of them have a tail? I do not believe that. I see plenty of Dobermanns, and they are being kept as pets. There is no regard in the amendments for normal practice, for the way in which people treat their dogs when they just keep them as domestic pets. Most of those dogs do not have their tail docked. There is no reason to do it, unless the dog is going to be shown or is a working dog. In the case of working dogs, we do not have a problem. It seems to be perfectly good sense.</p>
<p>I will not go on any longer, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is the way that we feel about the amendments. We will oppose all the amendments, except for amendment No 4.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. This debate is a repeat of the previous one. It is unfortunate that, when members discussed the matter in the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, we did not get the same arguments as those that Mr Beggs is putting forward now. In fact, he wanted to reinforce things and deal with the matter even more severely than the Department.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to support the statement that Mr Beggs and the Chairperson of the Committee made that unscrupulous dog owners would deliberately damage dogs&rsquo; tails. Saying that members of the Kennel Club in particular and people who show dogs would do that shows clearly that the Member does not understand what those involved in the showing of dogs are about. If he did, he would know that they think more of their dogs than they do of themselves. They look after their dogs and show them with pride. The idea that someone would injure a dog&rsquo;s tail in order to have it medically treated does not stand up.</p>

<p>If the Member had listened carefully to what I actually said, he would have recognised that other people have told me that that was a reason for not doing what I have done. However, because I believe that dog owners would not unscrupulously damage their pet&rsquo;s tail, I have tabled my amendment. It is not because of what the Member is saying; it is because I do not believe that dog owners, in general, would do such a thing.</p>
<p>The evidence in England and Wales indicates that the number of dogs that have been able to be shown because of medical intervention is relatively small.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.85" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90264" speakername="Trevor Clarke" time="17:00" url="">
<p>I want to clarify what Mr Beggs said. A look back at the Hansard report will show that he said in Committee that there may be unscrupulous people who would damage dogs&rsquo; tails so that they could go through the procedure. If Mr Beggs wants to check the Hansard report and correct me on that, he may do so. However, I am 99&middot;99% sure that that is what Mr Beggs said. I do not know whether Mr Molloy recalls that.</p>

<p>I do recollect that statement. I also recollect Mr Beggs talking about unscrupulous people who show dogs and organise dog shows using a loophole by charging for car parking, thereby getting around the legislation deliberately. Mr Beggs was going to reinforce the legislation and make it even stronger and more draconian than it is at present. I can understand why Mr Beggs is pulling back from that now. He is under pressure from constituents of his who show dogs and who, on reading the Hansard report, cannot believe some of what he has said over the past number of months.</p>

<p>Does the Member accept that there are unscrupulous puppy farmers who do many things to their animals? In putting forward legislation, one has to try to deal with all sorts of people. I have stated clearly today that, on balance, I do not believe that dog owners or pet owners would do it. That is why I tabled the amendment. Does the Member not accept that it was the dog-showing fraternity that indicated, in its publication, that it used the loophole of the car parking fee? It was not me who said that unscrupulous people would do that. In fact, it was the showing fraternity that indicated, in its news-sheet, that it does that.</p>

<p>We have heard all that before. Unfortunately, there was nothing new.</p>
<p>The reality is that this legislation is unnecessary and unnatural. The idea of trying to govern shows is outside the Department&rsquo;s remit. It should never have stepped into that arena. It is unnecessary to try to force the legislation on people who are involved in shows and those who are involved in the welfare of animals in that way. It would have been better if the Department had stuck to the welfare of animals that are within its control.</p>
<p>We have faced two issues. The first is that we have had very little or no consultation with councillors. They will be the people involved in the enforcement of dog licensing, because enforcement has been offloaded onto councils without consultation on the costs or implications. All councils were opposed to the offloading of legislation onto them in that way. Secondly, it has been exposed that the Committee system of taking information and consulting members of the public is inadequate. The Committee system of scrutinising Bills is inadequate. Members need to listen to what the public are saying on a number of issues, even if they do not agree with all that they hear. All that we have heard about is enforcement &mdash;</p>

<p>The Member is absolutely right. I know that it seems strange that I have agreed with him in Committee so many times. The Member has just said that Committee members should listen. Would it not have been useful for them to have been given the opportunity to listen? Mr Lunn said today that he has read bits and pieces, and heard arguments. I reinforce the point that the Committee never had an opportunity to speak to people who support the continuation of this practice. Although the Member has said that we should listen, it has been very difficult to listen to those people. Mr Beggs has said that one person contacted him. Wow &mdash; one person contacted him. Does that person speak for all the people who have traditionally docked dogs&rsquo; tails?</p>
<p>Like me, I am sure that Mr Molloy feels very disappointed that the Committee did not get the opportunity to listen to the hundreds of people who wanted to put forward their cases.</p>

<p>I accept that ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
<p>One of the issues is the process, which I know the Member spoke about earlier. If that process is flawed, the legislation will not be good, and that is one of my problems at present. The legislation that is being forced through is not good because it does not deal with the issues that the public are concerned about. At Committee, we did not get the opportunity to hear from the various different councils, organisations and people who are concerned about shows and tail docking and who have something to say about the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I am addressing the amendments, which deal with the docking of dogs&rsquo; tails and are a variation of the amendments that were tabled before. Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment deals with the legislation itself, and the legislation deals with the docking of dogs&rsquo; tails. We did not get the information that we needed from all those concerned about tail docking and about how the legislation will affect that. I want legislation that is beneficial to those who look after the welfare of dogs.</p>
<p>The way in which Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment has come about is unfortunate. It is a reversal of his original position on shows and takes the legislation a step further than it needs to go. There is no justification whatsoever for that in the present set-up. Those who have issues with the showing of dogs have not been given the opportunity to make their presentations. At last week&rsquo;s Committee meeting, I said that we needed an opportunity to hear those people&rsquo;s voices, but that did not happen. Instead, it was indicated that those people had cancelled plans for them to attend last week&rsquo;s meeting. However, on their behalf, I want to make it clear that they did not do so. They wanted to give evidence, and the Committee should have been flexible enough to deal with that. That information has now, unfortunately, been lost, because it was not heard by the Committee and did not become part of the Committee report. That is a sad situation.</p>
<p>On a number of occasions at Committee, Mr Clarke exposed the issues dealt with by the other amendments tabled today. However, it is unfortunate that Mr Weir was not there as Whip to instruct all the other members to follow suit, because better legislation would then have come through the Committee.</p>

<p>I thank the Member for being complimentary about the DUP. However, I have to say that it is a pity that the Member was whipped to vote against the removal of clause 6 the last time that Members went through the Lobbies.

<p>As I said last week in the debate about coursing, there is no whip too long. I was not in any way criticising the DUP for its whipping process. I was simply saying that had we got support from across the Committee, we would have better legislation.</p>
<p>If I were the Minister or anyone else here today, I would not be taking great comfort from P J Bradley&rsquo;s commentary or support, because it will be short-lived. It will be only a matter of weeks before he is criticising the Department in some other way. The fact that he is a member of the Veterinary Association was never raised at Committee at any time whatsoever, so it is useful that that came out during this debate.</p>
<p>The issue that we have dealt with the past number of times is very important.</p>

<p>I have to come to the Member&rsquo;s defence. Although Mr P J Bradley was quite happy to slap me down today, I recollect that he did make reference to being an honorary member of the British Veterinary Association. I have to put that on record in his defence. However, while I am on my feet, I have to say that, given that he is an honorary member of the British Veterinary Association, and given some of the comments that Mr Molloy and myself made about vets, he will know that it is better for them that the Bill goes through, because they will make more money.</p>

<p>Let me be very clear, Mr Speaker, that when the debate happened in Committee, Mr Bradley did not clarify that issue around the Veterinary Association.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that today&rsquo;s amendments were not put through at Consideration Stage. They are in front of us now, late in the day, and, unfortunately, the legislation is going through in that way.</p>

<p>I am extremely pleased to be speaking on the Welfare of Animal&rsquo;s Bill. At the risk of being holier than thou, I start by saying that some people are amazed by how much time we spend on smaller issues such as this rather than on life&rsquo;s more important matters. However, I am concerned that today we are trying to put too many rules on dog owners. Therefore, I will address all the amendments. I am amazed to see all the amendments that are going through, given the many other excellent clauses and actions in the Bill.</p>
<p>I got interested in the Bill only when it started on the matter of omitting working dogs from the tail docking ban. However, if Members think about it, they will realise that the issue of tail docking affects many other dogs. We have heard today that many of those dogs&rsquo; owners were not consulted or given the chance to put their case. We have probably overstepped the mark in all this. We heard from one person that the Kennel Club was the right body to make a decision on tail docking, and it probably remains the right body to do that, rather than the Assembly trying to put it in legislation. The Kennel Club knows, from all breeders of all types of breeds, what should be happening with dogs. It is because of that that I decided to stand up and speak on the matter.</p>
<p>We all know that it is best to dock a tail when an animal is very young, just as many things that we humans do to ourselves are better done when young. Given some of the things that older people, particularly in the film star world, do to their bodies, perhaps we are spending too much time on the wrong thing. We are here for the welfare of animals.</p>
<p>I will read from one letter that I received. A Member has already said that one letter does not necessarily count as a lobby. However, it is our job to listen to everybody. I am sure that one or two other Members received this letter. It says:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;Whilst attending a well known and respected veterinary practice in County Down 12 months ago, I heard an agonised screaming in the recovery <strong>room. I </strong>asked the vet what was creating such a terrible noise and he informed me that it was an adult Boxer in recovery from a partial tail amputation. To make matters worse this was the 2nd partial amputation the Boxer had undergone in 6 months for self inflicted tail damage. The vet proceeded to voice his disgust that this traditionally docked dog had been left with a tail and had so endured 2 surgical amputations, 2 anaesthetics and 2 very slow, extremely painful recoveries, due to a law passed by politicians who plainly had no knowledge of the subject they were legislating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I go back to my point that, if tail docking is to happen at all, it should happen at a very early age.</p>
<p>All of us who have dogs know that dogs wag their tails and will constantly amaze us by happily welcoming us home when, perhaps, we are not in the best of moods. They are still pleased to see us. They will wag their tails, and, in this modern world, they will damage them. When Members are knocking on doors canvassing and see dogs shut up in small back yards, think of the stone, wood and other things against which they will bang their tails. Dogs were not designed for the modern world that we have put them into. The Bill does not seem to look at how cruel it is to shut dogs in courtyards, to muzzle them and to damn them always to be on a lead. However, we are not talking about that today.</p>
<p>I am trying to get Members to think that we should leave this as a simple mechanism. We should allow dogs&rsquo; tails to be docked, if the owner wishes, when they are small dogs, whether for cosmetic or prophylactic reasons. It is best to dock a dog&rsquo;s tail when it is very young.</p>
<p>I was an owner of miniature and giant schnauzers, which were neither show nor working dogs. When I was small, they arrived with their tails docked. Later, we got one from Scotland that had a tail. I had so much trouble with that dog. It was not a show dog or a working dog, but when I took it for a walk, its tail would fill with burrs and other things. Members should try brushing those out of a dog&rsquo;s tail. That dog bit me every time I tried to do so, and yet it was my best friend.</p>
<p>We are concentrating on the wrong matters. We should leave this issue nice and simple so that it can be decided by a vet or by the Kennel Club. I know that this is an emotive subject, but we are going completely down the wrong track. I support the stronger amendments and, as Members can see, the Ulster Unionist Party is having a free vote.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.9.104" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90284" speakername="Michelle Gildernew" speakeroffice="The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development" time="17:15" url="">
<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I will start by reflecting on what happened in the Chamber two weeks ago when we debated the amendments that were proposed at Consideration Stage. Eighty Members voted on the question that the amended clause 6 on tail docking stand part of the Bill; an overwhelming majority of 61 voted in favour. That sent out a clear message that the barbaric procedure of the cosmetic docking of dogs&rsquo; tails is totally unacceptable in the North of Ireland.</p>
<p>For Members&rsquo; clarification, prophylactic docking is non-therapeutic. It is the docking of a dog&rsquo;s tail as a precautionary measure, based on the premise that the tail may suffer damage in later life when the dog is working. Cosmetic docking is non-therapeutic and is performed so that a dog conforms to the breed standard and/or what the breeder may consider normal for that breed.</p>
<p>I am amazed that Peter Weir, Michelle McIlveen and Trevor Clarke have proposed amendments, which, if accepted, will allow cosmetic docking to continue, not just by the back door but straight in through the front door. I welcome the comments of many Members, particularly those of the Chairperson of the Agriculture Committee, which I found to be consistent with the Committee&rsquo;s report, and other Committee members, such as Willie Clarke and P J Bradley, concurred.</p>
<p>A key aim of the Bill is to prevent animals suffering unnecessary pain and distress, and docking a dog&rsquo;s tail for cosmetic reasons causes unnecessary suffering. It is not done for a dog&rsquo;s welfare. It is done purely for the sake of appearance. The Bill, as introduced, made it an offence to show a dog at an event to which members of the public are admitted on payment of a fee if the dog&rsquo;s tail had been docked on or after these powers come into force. The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development proposed an amendment to strengthen that offence and close any loopholes to prevent show organisers trying to circumvent the legislation by not charging an entry fee. I was grateful to the Committee, and that amendment has been made to the Bill.</p>
<p>How time &mdash; just two weeks &mdash; can change things. Trevor Clarke, a member of the Committee, has put his name to these ridiculous amendments to clause 6. Amendment Nos 1 and 2 are designed purely to allow cosmetic docking for show dogs; they are totally unworkable and would be impossible to police or enforce. Francie Molloy talked about councils enforcing that. However, they would have a far bigger headache if the amendments are passed today, as they would allow cosmetic docking to be done on any dog. Trevor Clarke&rsquo;s aim is to make clause 6 useless and to achieve what he failed to achieve at Consideration Stage when he tried to have the entire clause voted out of the Bill.</p>
<p>If amendment Nos 1 and 2 are made, the effect will be to negate clause 6, which would leave us in a worse position than before we introduced the Bill. When the clause is commenced, the current power in the Welfare of Animals Act 1972 will fall. If amendment Nos 1 and 2 are voted through, we will no longer have any powers to require pups to be docked before their eyes open. It will also be totally impossible to enforce the require&shy;ment that only a veterinary surgeon may undertake the procedure for show dogs. Amendment No 2 also makes it impossible to certify any exemption for working dogs. The North of Ireland will become the docking capital of these islands, which would send out the message that the welfare of dogs here is of no importance. I cautioned Members that that would be the result when Trevor Clarke tried to vote down the clause at Consideration Stage, but, of course, he has ignored that advice. He obviously does not care whether pups or dogs suffer.</p>
<p>One may well ask why show dogs are docked. Let us be very clear: there is no evidence or justification to support a case for docking dogs&rsquo; tails for the purposes of showing. Show dogs are not docked to enhance the health or welfare of the dog, but to meet out-of-date breed standards that the Kennel Club has now changed. Allowing the showing of a dog with a docked tail is supporting and promoting cosmetic docking. It will do nothing to change the mindset of breeders, puppy farmers &mdash; as other Members have highlighted &mdash; or show organisers. It will do nothing to change the fact that that should be the standard of that dog. The purpose of the Bill making it an offence to show a dog with a docked tail is to send out a clear message to breeders and the showing fraternity that tail docking causes unnecessary pain, suffering and distress to pups and must be stopped. It is also to send out the message that it is perfectly natural for a show dog to have a tail and that it is, frankly, barbaric to cut off a dog&rsquo;s tail just for presentation purposes.</p>
<p>From the debate, it is clear that the majority of right-thinking Members are opposed to cosmetic docking. In banning the showing of dogs with docked tails, the House is saying that the unacceptable practice of cosmetic docking must stop.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>I also caution against Members taking what they may think is an easy way out and voting in favour of amendment No 3, which is designed to remove the provision that makes it an offence to show a dog with a docked tail. I understand why someone who currently owns a docked dog would want to be allowed to continue to show that dog. That is already catered for in the Bill. Any dog that has been docked before these powers are commenced can be shown for the rest of its life; there is not a problem with that.</p>
<p>If amendment Nos 1 and 2 are rejected today, we will have banned cosmetic docking in the North of Ireland. However, if amendment No 3 is voted through, we must ask where the docked dogs to be shown will come from. It would have to be from Europe and beyond because cosmetic docking is already banned in Britain, and we have heard that the South is heading in a similar direction. Anyone who votes for amendment No 3 needs to be aware that they will be encouraging the transportation of very young pups with docked tails on long journeys from Europe and beyond. Although most people will bring those docked pups into the North legally, others will not. If we encourage that trade, we will risk the introduction of rabies and other diseases to these islands and consign young pups to further pain and suffering as a result of not only the tail docking procedure but the long journeys that they will have to endure.</p>
<p>Members have expressed concern that our economy would suffer if dog shows were relocated to other places because dogs with docked tails cannot be shown at dog shows in the North. However, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the South, as part of its proposed new animal health and welfare legislation, has already consulted on a proposal to ban mutilations of animals, including the docking of dogs&rsquo; tails. As part of the all-island animal health and welfare strategy, we are committed to ensuring that our respective animal health and welfare legislation is as compatible as possible. The South of Ireland is already moving in the same direction as us, so it is very unlikely that shows will be relocated. In addition, the Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development advised the House two weeks ago that the EU is looking at banning the showing of dogs with docked tails, so it is obvious that the EU is also concerned about the practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that a ban on showing dogs with docked tails was introduced in England and Wales nearly four years ago, and it has not impacted on the running of dog shows in Britain. As I listened to Roy Beggs, I felt that he was a bit confused about that, because he said that his proposed amendment was not being abused in England and Wales. However, there is no such exemption in England and Wales, where people have been banned from showing dogs with docked tails for the past four years.</p>
<p>The Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development advised the House at Consideration Stage &mdash;</p>

<p>No. After what I have listened to, I am in no humour to give way.</p>
<p>The Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development advised the House at Consideration Stage that the Kennel Club had expressed its view to the Committee that, for the purpose of clarity, we should introduce an immediate ban on the showing of dogs with docked tails.</p>
<p>Amendment No 5 would give the Department the power to make regulations specifying the breeds of dogs for the purposes of showing. Am I missing something here? Surely all breeds of dogs can be shown. Why would we waste taxpayers&rsquo; money on making meaningless legislation?</p>
<p>Amendment Nos 7 and 8 &mdash; again tabled by the aforementioned DUP Members &mdash; are designed to delay the introduction of a ban on cosmetic docking for two years. No plausible explanation for delaying the implementation of those powers has been given to us, in spite of numerous interruptions to other Members&rsquo; comments by the Members who tabled those amendments or, for that matter, anybody else. I listened very carefully to everything that was said today. Why should we allow the barbaric practice of cosmetic docking to continue for one minute longer than necessary, never mind two years?</p>
<p>I turn now to amendment No 4, which was tabled by Roy Beggs and would allow dogs that have had their tails amputated because of injury to be shown. Although I appreciate why the amendment was tabled, it has not been fully thought through. I understand that it was Mr Beggs who suggested an earlier Committee amendment at Consideration Stage to close loopholes around the showing of dogs with docked tails, so I am sure that he does not want to introduce inadvertently a different and more serious loophole</p>
<p>Some Members commented on the fact that amendment No 4 would create a loophole for unscrupulous breeders and owners to find a way around the ban on showing a dog with a docked tail. I have no doubt that the majority of people who <strong>show dogs genuinely care about their animals and would not dream of injuring them. However, let us be clear</strong>: there are other unscrupulous people who would do anything and might even be prepared to injure a dog&rsquo;s tail deliberately to ensure that it has to be amputated, thus making the dog eligible for showing. That is a genuine concern that I have with Roy Beggs&rsquo;s amendment, so I ask Members &mdash; the Alliance Party said that it is thinking about voting for it &mdash; to think very carefully. Amendment No 4 would create a loophole for unscrupulous people to deliberately injure dogs&rsquo; tails, and the thought &mdash;</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that, in its shows in England and Wales, the Kennel Club grants an exemption to members where fees are not paid and, therefore, not legislated for? In other words, the Kennel Club grants the dog-showing fraternity an exemption, although the number of exemptions granted is very low.</p>

<p>I do not understand the rationale behind that. There is no exemption in England and Wales. A person&rsquo;s ability not to pay into a show because he or she is showing docked dogs is irrelevant in this case.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe that, if amendment No 4 is brought forward, it will create a loophole for unscrupulous people. The thought might be shocking, but it will become a reality if the amendment is voted through. In addition, I can guarantee here and now that we would have a dramatic increase in so-called tail injuries to dogs such as Dobermanns, Rottweilers and boxers, to name but a few. I am sure that we can all picture a situation in which a person claims that his or her young pup has had its tail injured by children or in which the breeder claims that the bitch lay on the pup&rsquo;s tail and broke it, requiring it to be amputated, when, in reality, the pup was always destined for the show ring and the exhibiter&rsquo;s preference was to show it without a tail.</p>
<p>If Members agree to amendment No 4, we will put the veterinary profession in an untenable position, because vets will be called on to amputate an injured dog&rsquo;s tail when they suspect that the tail has been damaged deliberately just to facilitate showing the dog with a docked tail. At the same time, there will be insufficient evidence to do anything about it. Worse still, we will see a dramatic increase &mdash; believe me, this does go on &mdash; in laypeople removing a dog&rsquo;s tail to prevent or to remove a so-called immediate danger to the life of the dog.</p>
<p>We have to be realistic. We should not make legislation to accommodate what is likely to be a very small number of show dogs that genuinely injure their tails during their showing life. To do so would create a major loophole in the legislation that would leave the way open for unscrupulous people to injure dogs to ensure that they end up docked. If we stand firm on this, it will become socially unacceptable to show a dog with a docked tail, irrespective of why it has been docked. Ultimately, that is what we want to do.</p>
<p>I also cannot imagine why anybody would want to show a dog that has had its tail amputated because of injury. Whether a tail, a leg, an ear or whatever, surely showing is about demonstrating the best qualities of a breed, and how can a dog with no tail demonstrate the best qualities of a breed that is meant to have a full tail? Make no mistake, the amendments tabled by some DUP Members are a blatant attempt to legitimise cosmetic docking and to deliberately overturn the decision that the Assembly made on 1 February 2011 to ban cosmetic docking. Peter Weir mentioned dog trials. Dog trials are for working dogs to show off their skills, not for show dogs, so, again, there is a wee bit of confusion creeping in.</p>
<p>As I said, although amendment No 4, which was tabled by Roy Beggs, is well-intentioned, it basically introduces a loophole in the legislation through which a horse and cart could be driven. It will encourage unscrupulous individuals to deliberately injure the tails of pups and adult dogs to ensure that they are amputated, thus facilitating selfish and callous owners who do not care about the dog&rsquo;s welfare but want to show a dog with a docked tail at any cost.</p>
<p>I remind the Assembly that this is the last opportunity that we have to amend the Bill. Any late, ill-considered changes that are voted through today will be on the statute book for a long time. Some of the amendments are certainly ill-considered. They remove offences from the Bill but leave in the penalties for the offence.</p>
<p>Members, we have before us a good piece of animal welfare legislation. Let us not destroy it today and make us a laughing stock in Europe. I am sure that we want other countries to see us as legislators who make good, evidence-based policy and legislation.</p>

<p>We should not let ourselves be pushed into making knee-jerk amendments to good legislation in response to sustained lobbying from one or two individuals.

<p>By this stage, everyone probably knows my position, so I do not think that I have to go into it in detail again. However, I would like to summarise what some of those who spoke in the debate said.</p>
<p>Peter Weir, who moved most of the amendments, was right when he said that not all of the evidence was taken. That is why I am fearful. Although the Minister outlined that this is our last opportunity to amend the Bill, whether she likes the amendments or not, everyone should be given an opportunity to put forward their opinion or case. I want to put on record that I am disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to take representations from people who own docked breeds.</p>
<p>I also agree with what Mr Weir said about registered breeders. The statistics are there. There has been a range of decline from 37% to 70% in the numbers in England since the ban came in there, and the same is likely to happen in Northern Ireland. Therefore, the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the matter will not cause any economic problems in Northern Ireland is totally misleading. The statistics are there in England. Although she can use figures from the Republic, where they are looking at something currently, the fact is that England has been through the process and the decline has been anywhere between 37% and 70% in some of the given breeds. Therefore, the provisions will drive numbers down and will, in turn, cause some loss to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>I turn now to the Chairman of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, who is a member of my party. Although he referenced in his remarks his chairmanship of the Committee, most of his speech focused on a consensus on something that the Committee had agreed on. I have to disagree with that, because the amendments were tabled only last Thursday. The last opportunity that the Committee had to meet was last Tuesday, so it never had the opportunity to discuss the amendments put by Mr Weir or Mr Beggs today. For the Committee Chairperson to suggest that the Committee has come to a position on the matter is wrong.</p>
<p>Then we came to Willie Clarke, who one could believe was likened to the Minister&rsquo;s poodle, because he has toed the line ever since this Bill has come to the &mdash;</p>

<p>Most of his time was spent talking about animal welfare, Mr Speaker, and I know that you were not in the House during that time. Although he was very passionate about animal welfare, and I think that it is right that any Member should express concern about animal welfare, he was asked on one, two, or possible three occasions and could not give reasons why, when it came to hare coursing, he was not concerned about the welfare of that particular animal.</p>

<p>Will the Member express concern that the Minister made the same argument when she said in her address at the end of the debate that this is a good piece of animal welfare legislation and that, if we do not pass it, we will be a laughing stock in Europe? Is Sinn F&eacute;in not a laughing stock, given that it has today opposed the amendments proposed by this party on the grounds of animal welfare yet only last week it brought forward its own amendments to allow the continuation of hare coursing? Is that not the biggest hypocritical position that Sinn F&eacute;in has taken in recent times?</p>

<p>Yes. One could suggest that it is the biggest U-turn that they ever had. But, there we have it. We do not get consistency where Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned. Even in Committee, as we can see here today, there was a difference of opinion within Sinn F&eacute;in, and it is interesting to note that one of its Members, who is probably more likely to be in favour of our amendments, has left the Chamber. During the whole debate in Committee, Mr Molloy and I were allied in trying to continue the practice of tail docking while wanting some protection placed on the welfare of animals by making sure that it is done by a veterinary surgeon. The Member was consistent.</p>

<p>No. The Minister would not give way when she had her opportunity, and she had more than ample time to speak. I must say that it was difficult to listen to.</p>
<p>It is interesting that, on the previous occasion when Mr Molloy had the opportunity to vote this clause out, he was whipped into place by the Minister to do as he was told. We have seen that practice time and again by Sinn F&eacute;in. In the past, it has probably been known to do more than whipping.</p>
<p>I move to P J Bradley&rsquo;s comments, and I must clarify that he did, whether Mr Molloy agrees or not, declare an interest in Committee that he was an honorary member of the Veterinary Association. However, I think that that was a problem in a sense, because, as I said in Committee, I think that the fact that we are removing the opportunity for tail docking and are moving towards the possibility of more amputations is playing into the hands of the Veterinary Association in Northern Ireland, which could create more work for itself.</p>
<p>Mr Kinahan considered that his contribution was not valuable: I think it was. His colleague suggested that only nine dogs a month in the UK are affected by the amputation of tails, yet Mr Kinahan read out a letter from a dog owner in County Down whose dog has had two amputations. I think he made a very valuable contribution. The letter sets out very clearly the problems of a dog that has not had its tail docked. He said that it has to be done at an early age. The legislation suggests that it should be done within the first five or six days, which is something that we can all support.</p>

<p>I beg to move</p>
<p class="italic">That the Transport Bill [NIA 29/09] do now pass.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to address the specific provisions of the Bill today. Instead, I will concentrate on the main purpose of the Bill, which is to provide new arrangements for the delivery of public passenger transport services in the North and to ensure our compliance with European law.</p>
<p>The current legislation governing the provision of public passenger transport services was established in 1967 in a very different set of circumstances. It needs to be revised to allow for the delivery of modern services that meet passenger need and to provide for innovation in the market, including the introduction of rapid transit services in Belfast. It will also allow the Department to work closely with stakeholders and local councils in the development of local public transport plans, which will inform the specification of contracts and deliver services that meet individual passenger needs, regardless of where they live. The passing of the Bill will allow for the creation of structures that will drive that change.</p>
<p>The legislation is designed to encourage passenger growth and to make public transport people&rsquo;s first choice, not the last resort. Members can also be assured that the reorganisation of structures and functions in my Department will provide the mechanisms to ensure more efficient provision of services through better allocation of resources according to public priorities.</p>
<p>The Bill is underpinned by reform proposals, which have been developed over the past four years in consultation with key stakeholders in the transport, community and business sectors, and informed further by a major public consultation exercise. I thank those stakeholders for their invaluable contribution to the development of this important legislation. I also thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development and the Committee members for their detailed consideration and scrutiny of the Bill during its Committee Stage, and for their recommendations, which have now been incorporated into the Bill.</p>
<p>The Bill will assist in creating an efficient, effective and sustainable public transport system that contributes to the Executive&rsquo;s transportation, environmental, social inclusion and equality objectives while supporting the development of the wider economy. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<p>I express the Committee&rsquo;s thanks to the witnesses who provided evidence, to the Minister and the departmental Bill team for their co-operation and assistance during the passage of the Bill, particularly during Committee Stage, and also to the Assembly&rsquo;s Bill Office team and the Committee staff for their work in producing the report on the Transport Bill. I personally want to thank Committee members for the efforts and commitments that they brought to the pre-legislative stage and Committee Stage of the Bill.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p>The issue before us is whether the Assembly is content to endorse the Transport Bill. As Members are aware from previous debates, the purpose of the Bill is to create an effective, efficient and sustainable public transport system that contributes to the Executive&rsquo;s transportation, environmental, social inclusion and equality objectives.</p>
<p>The Committee welcomed the opportunity to take forward the Committee Stage of the Bill. It considered the evidence received during its clause-by-clause scrutiny and agreed to all the clauses. The Committee&rsquo;s report made recom&shy;mendations to improve the Bill. I am pleased to say that 12 amendments were made at Consideration Stage. All of those were agreed by the Committee and the Minister, signed jointly by myself and the Minister and passed by the Assembly. The Committee made other recommendations not involving amendments to the legislation. For the sake of brevity, I, like the Minister, do not propose to rehearse those today.</p>
<p>I thank the Members who contributed to the debates on the Bill. I am happy to advise that the Committee for Regional Development commends the Transport Bill to the House and recommends that it do now pass.</p>

<p>I echo the thanks of the Minister and the Chairperson of the Committee to those from inside and outside the House who participated in the debate about and finalisation of the Bill. I also thank the Bill team and the Committee team, who did most of the work, as is always the case, to ensure that the legislation was in a fit state to be before us today.</p>
<p>I welcome the Bill, as amended. The amendments were important and substantial. They strengthened the Bill and put it in an appropriate context that considers not just the economic and social needs of our region but the need to ensure that public transport services are accessible to the people of this part of Ireland and that we design our public transport infrastructure and services in a way that meets the sustainability requirements of our region.</p>
<p>As the Bill becomes law, we must ensure that the resources are available to the House and the Minister, whoever he or she may be, at the Department for Regional Development, so that it can fulfil its potential. Tragically, that has not been so over the past few years. The financial commitment to sustainable transport has not met the statutory desire to see growth in sustainable transport.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s willingness to engage in a constructive debate with the Committee. I acknowledge his policy commitment to promote a more sustainable transport environment in our region, and I encourage him to continue to advocate that that be matched by the necessary investment to ensure that what we make law can become a reality for all our citizens.</p>

<p>As the Minister said, the Bill is aimed at encouraging people to use public transport as their first choice. It is disappointing, though, that the Budget for the next four years does nothing to encourage people to use public transport when 86% of the Department for Regional Development capital spend will be on roads, which will encourage more cars, congestion and pollution.</p>
<p>The reduction in subsidy to Translink and community transport will also add to the negative impact on people using public transport and increase isolation, particularly for older people, young people, women and people with a disability. I am very disappointed about that. We may have the Bill, but we need the resources and budget to follow it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.10.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90324" speakername="Conor Murphy" time="18:30" url="">
<p>I thank Members for their contribution to the debate and their support for the Bill. I have no desire to elongate proceedings any further. The last two Members spoke about resources. Of course, we want to ensure that we have resources to go forward with the Bill and to encourage the development and promotion of public transport. An amendment has been tabled to the motion for the next debate that would take some money away from DRD. That is not consistent with arguing that we need more resources.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for raising that point. I want to put it on the record, as it will be when the amendment is moved, that the amendment will not take any money away from sustainable transport; it will be focused entirely on reducing consultancy costs and senior executive costs in the Department. I am keen to assure Members that the amendment will not, in any way, undermine the Minister&rsquo;s ability to deliver public transport services.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.10.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90324" speakername="Conor Murphy" time="18:30" url="">
<p>That remains to be seen, and whether that amendment is passed is a question for the next debate. Previous propositions from a number of years back talked about taking money from the Departments and putting it into social housing. It is useful that the debate that follows this will address the issue of resources.</p>
<p>Certainly, the last Member who spoke is aware, from being a member of the Committee for Regional Development, of the very substantial hit on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget proposed in the draft Budget. Given that my Department is probably the biggest capital spender in the Executive, he will be aware of the difficulties that that reduction has presented for us and the implications of it. He will know that we had to look at some major capital projects to transfer and free up some money to put into the public transport side, which we did. Those are unpopular decisions with the people who would have liked to see those major capital projects go ahead. Nonetheless, that is the proposition that we put forward, and obviously the budget will be debated and finalised at the end of the consultation process. We want to ensure that we have sufficient resources. We all recognise that we have a very difficult task in balancing the books.</p>
<p>The Member should also recognise that, given that the vast bulk of our public transport uses roads, it is not simply a case of investment in roads versus investment in public transport. Investment in roads supports and encourages the use of public transport as well as other types of investment.</p>
<p>I thank Members for their contributions to the debate. I particularly thank the Chairperson of the Committee and Committee members for their support of the Bill. I look forward to continued engagement with the Committee as the implementation of the public transport reforms progresses.</p>

<p>Before we proceed with the debate &mdash; I hope that he is not going to flee the Chamber &mdash; perhaps the Member for North Belfast, Mr Cobain, who is also a member of the Business Committee, ought to issue an apology on behalf of that Committee to the wives, girlfriends, lovers and partners of Members, staff and pressmen who must stay here tonight, instead of going out for romantic evenings and candlelit dinners. It has been described as the cruellest cut of all; I do not know whether that is true. However, I hope that the Member for North Belfast bears that in mind, and, if he speaks in the debate, perhaps he will say something about it.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, during the take note debate on the draft Budget, the emphasis was on planning for the future and for the next four years in particular. However, today&rsquo;s debate is about the final spending plans for the current financial year, the last year of the Executive&rsquo;s first Budget, 2008-2011. The first Supply resolution seeks the Assembly&rsquo;s approval of the Executive&rsquo;s final spending plans for 2010-11, as detailed in the spring Supplementary Estimates (SSEs) that were laid before the Assembly on 7 February. The second resolution requests interim resources and funding for the first few months of 2011-12 in the form of a Vote on Account. I request the levels of Supply set out in the resolutions under section 63 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which provides for the Minister of Finance and Personnel to make recommendations to the Assembly leading to cash appropriations from the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund.</p>
<p>The amounts that I ask the House to vote in supply are considerable: over &pound;15 billion of cash, over &pound;16 billion of resources and over &pound;2 billion of accruing resources for spend and use by Departments and other public bodies in Northern Ireland. The first Supply motion sums up the spring Supplementary Estimates that are before the House for approval. I remind Members that those SSEs reflect all the in-year changes that were made since the Main Estimates were approved by the Assembly last June. They reflect the departmental expenditure limit (DEL) changes that were agreed in the monitoring rounds in June, September and December, as well as the annually managed expenditure (AME) funding that was agreed by the Treasury since the approval of the 2010-11 Main Estimates last June.</p>
<p>This is the debate, as the financial year 2010-11 draws to a close, in which I want to pause and look back over the past financial year. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I want to take a few moments to reminisce. The expenditure plans for 2010-11 were first set in the Budget in 2007. This time last year, those plans were reviewed and revised by the Executive, and they were agreed by the Assembly last April. Members will remember clearly that the Chancellor&rsquo;s announcement on 24 May of &pound;6 billion of savings in public expenditure in 2010-11 resulted in a &pound;127&middot;8 million reduction in the Northern Ireland allocation. That caused much consternation in the House, but the Executive discussed the options and were able to address that pressure through the monitoring rounds process. In addition to addressing the &pound;128&middot;7 million pressure, the monitoring rounds also facilitated Departments to declare reduced requirements and the Executive to reallocate that funding to high-priority areas.</p>
<p>As to the current expenditure position in 2010-11, the amount of current reduced requirements in the first three monitoring rounds was again much reduced, with some &pound;45 million in comparison to &pound;90 million, &pound;135 million and &pound;176 million in the three preceding financial years respectively. On that note, I voiced my disappointment today that that good performance did not continue into the February monitoring round.</p>
<p>I will not repeat the details, but suffice it to stress that Departments must practise good financial forecasting and management and not leave the surrender of reduced requirements until the February monitoring round. That puts the Executive in a difficult position, as it is often too late, at that stage, for other Departments to use the resources that have been unspent. Therefore, they are lost to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>On the capital front, the big issue exercising Members at this stage last year was the &pound;200 million shortfall in DARD&rsquo;s budget arising from the Crossnacreevy site. Members predicted all sorts of doom. Although I assured them that we could handle the &pound;200 million shortfall in monitoring rounds, many did not believe it. However, the outcome was that the Executive were able, in the June monitoring round, to address the shortfall from slippage and other projects such as the strategic waste infrastructure and the Royal Exchange project. The purpose of monitoring rounds is to reallocate reduced requirements from one area to another area of need.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the slippage in the two large projects just mentioned, the remaining capital reduced requirements in the first three monitoring rounds amounted to only &pound;62 million, which is a sign that, by and large, the delivery of capital projects is being progressed on the ground as planned. Of those capital reduced requirements, the Executive decided in December, through the Treasury end-year flexibility arrangements, to carry forward &pound;23 million into 2011-12 in light of the very difficult capital position next year.</p>
<p>Despite the restrained financial position in current and capital during the three in-year monitoring rounds, some significant allocations were made to Departments, hence the revised Estimates before the Chamber today for approval in the first motion. Members will recall that, in June, &pound;20 million was allocated to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety under the first call on available resources, and that was established in the 2008-2011 Budget settlement. That was to provide the Health Department with certainty, at an early stage in the financial year, of the full &pound;20 million allocation and to facilitate effective planning in its use of resources.</p>
<p>In December, &pound;3&middot;6 million of capital was also allocated to equipment and capital works; &pound;1&middot;9 was allocated to meet the increased cost for some Departments of new functions or the expansion of functions arising from the devolution of policing and justice; and &pound;2 million was allocated to DARD for animal disease compensation, which was a statutory and therefore inescapable cost for that Department. DARD also received &pound;4&middot;6 million in respect of modulation match funding for the Northern Ireland rural development programme, the woodland grant scheme and environmentally sensitive areas, and &pound;2&middot;6 million towards the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute pensions.</p>
<p>To address the flooding difficulties encountered in Fermanagh last year, OFMDFM was allocated &pound;1&middot;4 million after a cross-departmental bid. The Department of Education was allocated &pound;16 million towards capital works in light of concern over the level of investment in the schools infrastructure, ever mindful of the additional benefit that that support would give to the construction sector during the recession.</p>
<p>The Department for Employment and Learning received &pound;16&middot;5 million to address the statutory student finance pressures arising from a greater uptake as a result of the economic downturn, and &pound;1 million for health and safety works in the further education sector. The important Bombardier CSeries project was allocated &pound;28 million, with the resultant impact on jobs and investment for Northern Ireland, and my Department received &pound;2 million towards the cost of the 2011 census and &pound;6&middot;1 million for the accommodation costs of Northern Ireland Departments.</p>
<p>The Executive were also able to give &pound;2 million to DOE to contribute to the significant pressures caused by the shortfall in planning receipts and &pound;1&middot;6 million for the e-PIC planning system. In addition, a capital investment allocation of &pound;2 million was given to DOE in assistance to local government for the cost of new recycling and composting infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Department for Regional Development was allocated &pound;5&middot;1 million for provisions, &pound;7&middot;5 million of capital for roads structural maintenance and the A2 Broadbridge Maydown to City of Derry Airport project. DETI pressures amounting to &pound;3&middot;7 million for remedial work on abandoned mines and inescapable Harland and Wolff employee liability claims were also met. With the economic benefits associated with contractually committed urban regeneration projects in mind, the Executive allocated &pound;10 million in the June monitoring round to DSD, and, of course, the cash cost across Departments of addressing the equal pay liability of &pound;120 million was met in-year.</p>
<p>Those are just some of the departmental expenditure limit allocations in the monitoring rounds, but Members must not forget that, in addition, provision was made in the AME exercises and the SSEs in 2010-11 for, among other things, &pound;2&middot;8 billion of non-contributory and income-related social security benefits to the most vulnerable in our society. That funding provides mainly for expenditure on disability benefits, income support, pension credit, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and housing benefits, which are all very necessary support for families and people in need in Northern Ireland in these difficult economic times.</p>
<p>Before leaving the detail of the SSEs, I want to inform the House that some additional headroom has been built into them over and above the December monitoring position. At the preparation of the SSEs in January, it was thought prudent &mdash; as the SSEs in the Budget Bill are the final statutory ceiling on spending plans &mdash; to include headroom amounting to around &pound;20 million to provide the Executive with the flexibility in the February monitoring round to make allocations if resources became available. That forward thinking was particularly important this year in the light of the closure of the end-year flexibility scheme, which means that any resources not used in 2010-11 cannot be carried forward and will be lost to the Executive. The SSEs also include a few technical adjustments that were processed in the February monitoring round. Such adjustments do not give additional spending power to the Executive. I emphasise to the House that such headroom has been included on the condition that the resources, if allocated in February monitoring, must be used only for the agreed purpose. Virement approval will not be given later to cover excess spending in any other areas. I am sure that Members will appreciate the wisdom of that course of action, and the February monitoring outcome has borne that out.</p>
<p>Let us turn to the second part, which is the Vote on Account; that is, turning from the current year and looking ahead to 2011-12. The second motion before the Assembly seeks approval to the issue of cash and resource Vote on Account to ensure the seamless continuation of services into the next financial year. I stress to the House that the amounts of cash and resources proposed are totally unrelated to the current Budget 2011-15 process; rather, they are an advance of around 45% of the final 2010-11 provision. That is to enable services to continue into 2010-11until the Main Estimates reflecting the first year of the Budget 2011-15 are prepared and presented to the Assembly for approval.</p>
<p>I commend to Members the 2010-11 spring Supplementary Estimates, the 2011-12 Vote on Account and the Supply motions tabled. At the end of today&rsquo;s debate, I will endeavour to deal with any issues that have been raised on the spring Supplementary Estimates and the Vote on Account.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.10.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90336" speakername="Margaret Ritchie" time="18:45" url="">
<p>I take this opportunity to summarise the position of the SDLP on the Supplementary Estimates and the Vote on Account, associated with the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget.</p>
<p>The spring Supplementary Estimates are, in effect, a tidying-up of the finances for this year, the year that we are in. Although it is a little confusing, particularly for our friends in the media, it is little to do with the Budget for the next four years. Again, the Vote on Account is a resolution to supply resources to allow initial spending into the first year of the Executive Budget. We think that it is the first stage of a flawed Budget and a flawed process, but, whatever we think of it, we will not vote to leave public services unfunded at the start of the next financial year.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we are advised that the procedure is such that, if any party or Member in the House wishes to amend the draft Budget, they must first amend the Vote on Account. Given that the Vote on Account relates only to a very small part of our draft Budget, the SDLP&rsquo;s technical amendment is representative of the type of change that we want to see in the overall Budget for the next four years. We, of course, welcome the fact that we have a draft Budget, as it means that people now have some idea of what the future holds. However, there are fundamental deficiencies in the draft Budget, and, although we can and must put them right, let me tell the House what is wrong and what needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>First, the draft Budget is largely the application of what was handed down by the coalition Government. The settlement envisaged cuts of some &pound;4 billion, and, when we net out receipts and a rates increase, the draft Budget envisages cuts of &pound;3&middot;2 billion. Bizarrely, one party that negotiated the draft Budget, including the &pound;3&middot;2 billion in cuts, is still inviting us to fight the Tory cuts. It agreed to those cuts, but wants us to fight the cuts. Is that stupid or dishonest, or is it both?</p>
<p>We can mitigate the cuts. The SDLP has produced a Budget document entitled &lsquo;Partnership and Economic Recovery&rsquo;, in which there are detailed proposals for additional new revenue streams and receipts and for cash-releasing efficiency savings. Again, one party pretended that the draft Budget already contains billions in new revenue. That is not true. When we strip away normal receipts, there is little new money. In fact, it amounts to less than 1% of the total draft Budget.</p>
<p>The Budget is crucial for the economy over the next four years, as currency, interest rates and taxation matters are decided elsewhere. The Executive&rsquo;s only real economic lever is public expenditure. That means that the draft Budget must be about much more than which Ministers are winners and which are losers, although it is easy to see the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in carve-up even at that level. However, it must deliver on an economic strategy. That is our second criticism: the draft Budget is not related to any economic strategy.</p>
<p>All economic commentators recognise the need to rebalance the Northern Ireland economy. That means reducing the public sector and making it more efficient; focusing on job creation; and investing scarce capital in the right areas. In fact, we look forward to the coalition Government&rsquo;s proposals for doing that for Northern Ireland. However, where are the proposals in this draft Budget to move assets and activities from the public sector to the private sector? Where is the plan to generate jobs in the short term and get the economy moving? Again, the SDLP&rsquo;s &lsquo;Partnership and Economic Recovery&rsquo; document provides many answers.</p>
<p class="italic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
<p>Let us sell the DRD car parks. They would do better in the private sector, generating a major receipt to fund other priorities. We should dispose of other assets that have a revenue stream. We also suggest looking at the Port of Belfast, among other areas. Indeed, consider Northern Ireland Water. The solution to the problem of making Northern Ireland Water perform better does not simply lie in bringing it back into DRD, as the Minister for Regional Development proposes. Is it really going to do better as a branch of the Civil Service? We should mutualise Northern Ireland Water so that it performs to commercial standards but does so in the public interest rather than for shareholder gain.</p>
<p>Where is job creation? There needs to be more investment in the tourism and construction sectors, which are indigenous and job rich.</p>
<p>Our third criticism is that the draft Budget is simply not joined up. Each Department has been given a haircut, but there has been little thinking outside departmental silos. The result is a Budget that has been generated by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in a private negotiation. I do not condemn that. We would have been in a much worse place if the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in had failed to reach meaningful agreement, because they have failed to reach agreement on parading, education, minority languages and North/South co-operation, to name a few. We are all paying the price for that. I welcome the fact that they have reached agreement, albeit on a seriously flawed Budget.</p>
<p>However, we now have a Health Minister who says that he has been allocated a capital budget to build a radiotherapy centre in Derry, but not the budget to run it. Only today, we were told that there are major delays in ambulances&rsquo; delivery of patients to A&amp;E centres, which is also because of the budget deficit. I understand that the Health Minister was treated disgracefully by the First Minister and deputy First Minister at the last Executive meeting.</p>
<p>In education, we have inadequate provision for the schools modernisation programme, which is of huge importance if we are to tackle the real failures and inequalities in our education system. We face the unacceptable prospect of hiking student fees, which is entirely avoidable and will only start to make third-level education the preserve of the rich once again. Our amendment will ensure the capping of student fees and no hike.</p>
<p>Another issue is, of course, housing. With the 40% overall reduction in capital, the housing budget has been cut by &mdash; would you believe it? &mdash; 40%. That means that, instead of building perhaps 2,000 houses in each of the next four years, we will now build only 50% of that &mdash; 1,000 houses. We have not reprioritised our capital programme, but just spread the pain around. Incidentally, if anyone can indentify an area of investment that does more to stimulate jobs, reduce human misery and meet important social policy objectives than investment in newbuild social housing, let us find more money for it.</p>
<p>Despite such shortfalls in housing, education and student finance, there is &pound;80 million for a new Sinn F&eacute;in-inspired community fund. The so-called social investment fund is to be directed to the party&rsquo;s chosen groups. I can only call it a slush fund. It is a disgrace, and the House should not tolerate it.</p>
<p>How do we sort all this out? We should forget about personalities and do what is genuinely best for the North. We should abandon the silo approach. The SDLP will not be territorial about the Budget. Our objections to the Budget reach far beyond the confines of DSD. We have listed some of the areas in which more resources are needed. As a party, we have shown how that can be achieved. I do not believe that anyone in the House truly believes that the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in draft Budget cannot be significantly improved on.</p>
<p>I hope that the Executive will heed what we are saying and work to arrive at a final Budget that my party can support. In the meantime, as a start, we today call for a reduction in expenditure on corporate overheads, consultancy, travel and overtime, and a reallocation of resources to front line health, student financial support, job creation in the tourism and construction sectors and anti-poverty measures. We call on the Executive and the Minister of Finance &mdash; he is not listening at the moment &mdash; to make a greater effort to find additional sources of revenue and capital.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his opening remarks and his explanation of the spring Supplementary Estimates and Vote on Account.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 2 February, the Committee for Finance and Personnel took evidence from DFP officials on the spring Supplementary Estimates for 2011 and the Vote on Account for 2011-12. Though routine, those are, by necessity, complex matters, and I thank the departmental officials for assisting the Committee. The spring Supplementary Estimates, the Vote on Account and the associated Budget Bill give Departments the authority to spend and to set control limits on which they can be held to account by the Assembly. The Committee has approved accelerated passage for the Budget Bill, which will be introduced by the Minister later today. I have written to the Speaker to provide confirmation of that.</p>
<p>The opening Budget position for 2010-11 was agreed by the Assembly on 20 April 2010, following the review of the Executive&rsquo;s spending proposals that were set out in the 2008-2011 Budget. The spring Supplementary Estimates reflect the changes that have been made to that opening Budget position as a result of the monitoring rounds in June, September and December. Additionally, some headroom has been built in to facilitate any allocations made by the Executive in the February monitoring round, the outcome of which was announced earlier today.</p>
<p>The Committee previously considered the inclusion of headroom in the spring Supplementary Estimates and understands that although Estimates need to be taut and realistic, that is a necessary measure, because the outcome of the February monitoring round is not normally announced until early March. Given that the Budget Bill, incorporating the spring Supplementary Estimates and the Vote on Account, must be passed by the end of March, it is not possible to wait until that time to finalise the Estimates. However, in their evidence to the Committee, DFP officials explained that, in view of the removal of end-year flexibility, it was particularly important to ensure that sufficient headroom was built in this year to ensure that any reduced resources declared as part of the February monitoring round could be reallocated and used in this financial year, rather than being surrendered back to the Treasury and lost to the Executive.</p>
<p>Members also understand that headroom is not indicative of the amount of reduced resources that may be declared in February. For those Departments that indicated an intention to bid for resources in February, and where those bids have initially been assessed as reasonable, the upper limit to which they can spend is increased by building in headroom. The Department in question will then have the Assembly&rsquo;s approval to spend up to that limit if, and only if, any additional funding is allocated to it. The departmental officials stressed that DFP&rsquo;s Supply division will monitor the allocations to ensure that they are used only for the agreed purposes.</p>
<p>The Committee for Finance and Personnel has again undertaken an active role in scrutinising the quarterly monitoring rounds throughout the 2010-11 financial year. The Committee has received timely briefings on the Department&rsquo;s position prior to each monitoring round, followed up with written responses to queries raised. In addition, following the Minister&rsquo;s statements in plenary sittings on the outcome of each monitoring round, the Committee was briefed by DFP officials on strategic and cross-departmental issues relating to public expenditure and on the implications for DFP as a Department. The Committee recognises the value of monitoring rounds in allowing funds to be reallocated in-year. However, the ability of that process to cope with a significant amount of new or emerging spending pressures is limited, particularly in view of the declining amount of reduced requirements being surrendered in the monitoring rounds. That issue will need to be examined, going forward.</p>
<p>I turn now very briefly to the motion on the Vote on Account for 2011-12. That practical measure, which provides interim resources at approximately 45% of the 2010-11 provision, enables Departments to ensure that public services continue during the early part of the financial year until the Main Estimates 2011-12 and associated Budget are debated before the summer.</p>
<p>A LeasCheann Comhairle, I would like to speak briefly from a personal and party perspective, particularly about the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment. I listened to Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s opening statement, and I think that the SDLP needs to answer quite a few questions, particularly about the detail of its amendment. I listened to Ms Ritchie&rsquo;s robust defence of the Health Minister, Michael McGimpsey, which in itself is indicative of the SDLP/UUP/Tory alliance that seems to be emerging. Furthermore, her attack on the fund for the worst-off communities in our society was nothing short of disgraceful. It is nothing short of disgraceful that that fund, which would go towards the worst-off communities in each and every one of our constituencies, is being attacked by the SDLP. That is yet another aspect of the Tory agenda.</p>

<p>Does the Member agree that, if the Executive were genuinely serious about a fund to work on behalf of the most marginalised and poorest in our community, they would allow the Department with lead responsibility, the best expertise and understanding of the needs of the most marginalised and needy in our community to lead on that fund? That has not been the case, and it is for that reason that the fund has little credibility.</p>

<p>Conall McDevitt has let the cat out of the bag. He said that the SDLP is attacking OFMDFM because DSD did not get the money. That is the SDLP&rsquo;s political agenda. The party says that it is attacking the fund because it is a slush fund, but really it is because DSD did not get more money. That is the reality of the situation, which is, quite simply, disgraceful.</p>
<p>The SDLP needs to bring detailed proposals to the House. If the SDLP is serious about passing its amendment today, where are the details? What is going to happen to the Justice Department and the &pound;7 million &mdash;</p>

<p>I throw a challenge back to the Member. Where is the Sinn F&eacute;in fight against the Tory cuts in this Budget?</p>

<p>The way in which we challenge the cuts, as the Member should know, is by trying to mitigate them. This Budget has been handed down by the British Government. We need to face up to that challenge and mitigate cuts by using revenue-generating proposals, which the Executive have discussed &mdash;</p>

<p>I am not going to give way again, because I have only three minutes left.</p>
<p>The SDLP, which is so serious about coming to the House with its revenue-generating proposals to save us from this deficit and cut, did not come to the House until December. When the SDLP came forward with its proposals, they included ideas that Ministers had been discussing at the Budget review group. Therefore, it is misleading &mdash;</p>

<p>No, I will not give way.</p>
<p>The amendment is indicative of the kind of politics that the SDLP has adopted with regard to the Budget, the Assembly and the Executive. It is mischievous, and it is simply wrong. It is absolutely mischievous to come to the House today to propose that we take &pound;7 million out of the Justice Department, &pound;3&middot;8 million out of the Department for Regional Development and nearly &pound;10 million out of OFMDFM. How many jobs would that cost? What impact would that have? If the SDLP wants us to back those proposals, it has to outline the details. The SDLP cannot come here, throw figures in front of the House and expect to get any support. The SDLP needs to go back upstairs to its offices &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>

<p>Members of the SDLP need to catch themselves on. There is a better way to mitigate Tory cuts. The Budget review group is taking forward proposals for additional revenue, which should be allocated to front line services. That work must continue, and that is how we will mitigate cuts. We will not mitigate cuts by coming into the House and throwing down figures that are not thought out and have no detail whatsoever. Members of the SDLP need to catch themselves on. I look forward to the rest of the debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.10.28" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90285" speakername="Simon Hamilton" time="19:00" url="">
<p>Some of us on this side of the Chamber would quite happily sit back and let this domestic carry on all evening. To use the old saying: we do not get involved in domestics. However, this issue is much too serious for us to do that, as entertaining as the very adult debate that was going on for the past five minutes was.</p>
<p>As others, including the Minister, said, what is usually a technical, tidying-up exercise has today, unfortunately, been made into a bit of a mess. We are well used to attempts at political point scoring and grandstanding on occasions such as this. There was a previous attempt by another party to take a penny off the Estimates to try to make a broader point. Other parties at times said that they would oppose the Estimates going through on the Vote on Account, even though the ramifications of that opposition would be that money would run out in Departments very early into the next financial year.</p>
<p>I was thinking as I listened to the SDLP leader introduce her party&rsquo;s amendment that, if a creature from Mars came into this Chamber and listened to what she was saying, they might conclude that there is no intelligent life on this planet. They may also believe that the SDLP has had absolutely no role whatsoever in any matter to do with Budgets, finances and public spending in Northern Ireland. In fact, they may even conclude that the SDLP has no Members in the Executive. Perhaps that party&rsquo;s opposition to the Budget will lead to it leaving the Executive.</p>
<p>The SDLP has the right to oppose the Budget and should just go ahead and do that, if that is what it wants to do. Margaret Ritchie also indicated that she was not going speak about the draft Budget. She said that the discussion today was about the Estimates and the Vote on Account. When she proceeded, I waited &mdash; two minutes passed, three minutes passed, five minutes passed &mdash; and I thought, surely now, she will turn to the amendment. Seven minutes passed, eight minutes passed, nine of her 10 minutes&rsquo; speaking time passed, and there was still no reference to the amendment, which, whatever one may think about it, involves serious ramifications.</p>
<p>Having said that she was not going to spend any time talking about the draft Budget and then ignoring that by talking about it for about nine minutes and 50 seconds, I thought that the Member would at least have shown the House the courtesy of addressing the amendment before us to give Members some detail behind what is an absolutely detail-less amendment.</p>
<p>This may be very technical, very dry and, dare I say it, quite boring stuff, but when the Finance Minister comes before this House, he brings considerable detail. It is not as if he moves the motion, we debate it and everything carries on. There are details behind it. I know that I am not allowed to use visual aids, but while the Deputy Speaker is distracted, I am going to wave this document around nonetheless. It is not a best-seller; I accept that. I do not know whether it is downloadable in Kindle format. I am sure that if one could download or purchase it, it would not be very popular, but there it is. I accept that it is not a well-read document, but the detail is there. I dare say that once it is printed, probably nobody goes through it and tots up the totals again, but that is the detail. That is what the Finance Minister produces and gives to us. What we have in contrast is a few lines of an amendment with no detail.</p>

<p>I understand the point the that Member is trying to make, but the fact is that, as unpalatable as it is to bring an amendment to the Supply resolution and Vote on Account, if you do not do that, you are not in a position to exercise your democratic right to seek to influence the outcome of the Budget. It is painful and no one particularly wants to do it, but if you do not do it, you have no rights procedurally in this House. I am sure that if the Deputy Speaker wants to confirm that, he can do so.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Business Office issued specific guidelines as to how people should address the debate and how they should address speaking to the amendment. Further guidelines were issued to state that the debate should not be just on the amendment; even the proposer of the amendment must address the full debate. I agree that it is a difficult and technical way to go about this, but it is the only way to go about it, and the Member must at least acknowledge our right to do so.</p>

<p>I thank the Member for his intervention; he did at least try to give some explanation. Perhaps now he should stop writing leader&rsquo;s speeches for the SDLP and start giving them. It was certainly more useful than the contribution that was made. The fact is that, whatever the technicalities, the Member cannot expect the House to take the amendment seriously, no matter how serious his intent may be.</p>

<p>Hold on a second. Let me continue.</p>
<p>To be fair, what is before us is a little better than some of the other things that we get. It is a slightly more sophisticated approach than that which the Health Minister, for example, takes. He wants more money for health but does not give any explanation of from where that might come. At least the SDLP is saying which Departments the money should come from, but that is not without consequence. It says that it will take money from this Department, that Department and the other Department and that it will give it to certain Departments for certain types of expenditure, and that is fine. The easy part is saying where the money goes to, but saying where it comes from is a bit more difficult. That has not been answered. I will give way very briefly.</p>

<p>I will be very brief. If you feel it appropriate, Mr Deputy Speaker, you may wish to advise the House as to the fact that very specific guidelines were given as to how the amendment must be prepared and the fact that it must identify very specifically the way in which one must go about proposing an amendment on the Supply resolution and the Vote on Account. I wish that the system were different, but the fact is that if a party wants to exercise its right to try to promote a positive debate, it must go about it in this way.</p>

<p>I could not care less about the process.

The SDLP proposes to take &pound;7 million from the Department of Justice, &pound;3&middot;8 million from the Department for Regional Development and &pound;9 million from the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.

<p>With respect to the Member, it is not in any way the detail that is required to take a decision. The SDLP comes forward with proposals that would militate against any increase in student fees. They are proposing to take &pound;20 million from various Departments to fill a &pound;40 million gap.</p>

<p>That does not add up in anybody&rsquo;s language. Even the SDLP can work out that sum: &pound;20 million does not fill a &pound;40 million gap. The fact is that no detail is coming before us. We are being asked to vote on a pig in a poke, and they should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.10.59" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90265" speakername="Fred Cobain" speakeroffice="The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development" time="19:15" url="">
<p>I am sure that the Minister is glad that another two Members of the Business Committee have arrived: Mr Pat Ramsey and Lord Morrow, who he was attacking a short while ago. I stood up for you, Lord Morrow.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.] </span>I proposed 45 minutes for this debate to the Business Committee, but I was outvoted by the SDLP, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, all of which wanted four and a half hours. I just wanted to put that on record. [Laughter.]</p>
<p>As the Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development, I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the spring Supplementary Estimates and the Vote on Account for 2011-12. Last week, the Minister for Regional Development wrote to the Committee, setting out the main changes arising from the 2010 monitoring rounds, as reflected in the 2011 spring Supplementary Estimates. In the Department&rsquo;s spring Supplementary Estimates, provision has been included for an allocation in the February monitoring round of up to &pound;8&middot;6 million for the City of Derry Airport. The bid was made on ministerial direction, and the Committee is seeking additional information on the proposed allocation. This morning, the Minister alluded to the fact that there is no business case for that amount of money. That disturbs the Committee.</p>
<p>The Committee for Regional Development scrutinised the quarterly monitoring rounds in 2010-11 and responded to the Department on specific bids and easements in each monitoring round return. Based on its monitoring round scrutiny work, the Committee has two issues to raise: the need for flexibility in managing funding to deliver large-scale roads and waste-water infrastructure projects and the need for adequately resourced roads structural maintenance. Those issues are of strategic concern, not just for the Committee for Regional Development but because they cut across and underpin the economic and social well-being of the whole economy and all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>I turn first to funding for structural maintenance. The Committee has continually raised the need to provide funding for structural maintenance that is adequate and timely. It has done that in comments on the DRD monitoring round returns and on the Floor of the House during previous debates on the Budget and the Programme for Government. The quality of our roads infrastructure obviously and directly influences journey times and reliability; enhances or detracts from the tourist experience; enables or hinders access to rural education and training opportunities and to cultural, sporting and leisure services; enhances or hinders the competitiveness of Northern Ireland businesses; and, through its multiplier effect directly and indirectly on the economy, supports employment in Northern Ireland. Structural maintenance spending also has road safety implications, on which the Committee&rsquo;s views are well rehearsed.</p>
<p>Funding for structural maintenance must approach the levels set out in the Snaith Review. Professor Snaith recommended funding of approximately &pound;112 million per annum for structural maintenance and additional yearly allocations to address the backlog in structural maintenance of over &pound;700 million. Each year, we underspend in that area and, therefore, contribute to the backlog. After this year&rsquo;s prolonged period of winter weather, the need for roads structural maintenance is more pressing than ever.</p>
<p>I recognise that the Department is responding to the Committee&rsquo;s concerns on the issue by bidding for more structural maintenance funding at earlier stages in the monitoring round. However, allocations are not approaching the levels recommended by Professor Snaith, and the problem looks set to worsen in the next Budget period, when we will move from a record level of &pound;92 million allocated in 2011-12 to two years of allocations of less than half the recommended level: &pound;52 million and &pound;56 million, respectively.</p>
<p>That is simply not acceptable, and that level of underfunding simply cannot continue. The Committee will, of course, continue to pursue this matter during the draft Budget process and in the Budget debates.</p>
<p>The second point of concern that I wish to raise relates to the need for flexibility on in-year and end-year funding allocations for large-scale infrastructural projects, such as water or road schemes. The Committee noted that, in the February monitoring round, Northern Ireland Water surrendered &pound;13 million. Severe weather delayed work by two weeks in December and two weeks in January. Looking forward, 70% of the allocations for road schemes in the draft Budget are ring-fenced, and year two and year three allocations to Northern Ireland Water are only two thirds of the level agreed by the Utility Regulator&rsquo;s price control final determination. Unless some flexibility is introduced into the system of managing in-year funding, there is a danger that even more funding will be lost to those vital investment areas. I think that we can all agree that every effort should be made to support and facilitate investment in our water and sewerage infrastructure.</p>
<p>I want to make two or three points on the Budget as a member of the Ulster Unionist Party. To say that people who are socially and economically marginalised will not be influenced by this Budget is nonsense. We all know that, as far as the housing commitment is concerned, we need 2,500 new social homes every year. To keep pace, we will build 4,000 over the next four years, and that, obviously, has an impact on homelessness figures. People will be driven out of the social sector into the private-rented sector.</p>
<p>Mr McKay, who is just leaving, made the point that there will be increased rents, increased rates, increased bus and rail fares, an increase in child poverty and pensioner poverty, an increase in the level of social exclusion, and on and on. Therefore, to say that socially and economically marginalised people will not be affected by this Budget and that people are working to soften the impacts is nonsense. However, those are issues that we can discuss in more detail.</p>

<p>Does the Member also accept that there are serious pressures on the health budget that have prompted the Chief Medical Officer to say that there may be serious redundancies in the Health Service? Furthermore, the head of the health board has indicated that the Health Service will be minus &pound;1 million a day, which will lead to very severe consequences for the Health Service in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>I thank the Member for that intervention. I think that everyone knows that people who rely on and are affected by public services most are those who are most vulnerable, so any resource implication for the Health Service would have a major effect on such people. However, as I said, we can discuss those issues in more detail when we come to the Consideration Stage of the Budget Bill.</p>

<p>Oh, steady on, let me move on a bit; in a minute. There will be plenty to interrupt in a minute.</p>
<p>It is important that we recognise that we have five parties in the Executive. Parties have to decide whether they are part of that Executive or not. You cannot be inside and outside the Executive at the same time. People are crying out for leadership, not for Members to play games with the most important decision that the Assembly and Executive will have to take over the forthcoming weeks &mdash; the most important decision of the four-year mandate.</p>
<p>When proposing its amendment, the SDLP referred to the Executive as though they were some distant body with which it had no relationship and no contact. The Executive are the SDLP as much as they are the Alliance Party, the Ulster Unionists, Sinn F&eacute;in or the DUP. The Executive comprise every one of the parties in here.</p>

<p>Will the Member clarify the Alliance Party&rsquo;s change in position? When it came into the House at the beginning of the mandate, the party trumpeted itself as the official opposition. Will the Member state clearly that his party is no longer the official opposition and is part of the Executive?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2011-02-14.10.70" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90279" speakername="Stephen Farry" time="19:30" url="">
<p>When the Alliance Party entered the House it was not part of the Executive. For Mr Bradley&rsquo;s benefit, he may recall that, last April, David Ford was elected by the House to be the Minister of Justice and to join the Executive. That is the evidence; I do not need to clarify it for the Member.</p>
<p>We are clear that we are members of the Executive; we are not playing games with this matter. We have considerable concerns about the detail of the Budget, but the way to address those concerns is around the Executive table. If a party cannot live with what is finally negotiated and approved by the Executive and brought to the House, it has to consider its position in the Executive. You cannot be inside and outside the Executive at the same time, especially on the most important issues that go to the coherence of any Government: the striking of the Budget and the Programme for Government. You are either in or out, particularly on the Budget, and the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists have a big decision to take over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The amendment is in order; I have no difficulty in accepting that it is sound, procedurally. What confuses me is that the SDLP seeks to address the matter on the Floor of the Assembly rather than by briefing its Minister to fight his corner at the Executive table. If the SDLP is unhappy with what is agreed, it should withdraw from the Executive and fight the Budget on the Floor of the House. That is the only honest and coherent approach to take; otherwise it is simply gesture politics. Indeed, the fact that there was no explanation of the amendment gives further cause for concern, because, quite frankly, bringing something of this magnitude to the House today merits a proper explanation, particularly when one thinks of the consequences for the Departments concerned.</p>
<p>Perhaps SDLP Members will put meat on the bones of the amendment as the debate goes on. However, it is bizarre that the person who moved the amendment did not address that point. They are doing things the wrong way round. I have to draw attention to the cuts proposed for justice at a time when the Executive, and the Justice Minister in particular, are fighting for additional money from the Treasury to address the security threat in Northern Ireland. Indeed, the SDLP wants to give more powers to the police in Northern Ireland, because it wants to transfer intelligence gathering from MI5 to the PSNI. The party is entitled to make that argument, but in doing so, and if it is successful, that will mean putting more resources into the PSNI.</p>

<p>The Member may or may not be aware that the Department of Justice has a bit of a problem with its spending on consultants and, in particular, its spending on lawyers. In fact, the sum mentioned in the amendment is but a drop in the ocean of what the Department of Justice, by the Member&rsquo;s own Minister&rsquo;s admission, could save on extraordinary expenses for outside bodies that are not core to the delivery of justice services in this region.</p>

<p>Yes; and the Alliance Justice Minister is incredibly serious about addressing the problems of the cost of justice and legal aid. However, the way to do so is through a departmental spending plan, which the Justice Minister was one of the first to provide before Christmas, rather than arbitrarily mucking around with the figures. One cannot address those problems overnight.</p>

<p>Does the Member recognise that the main danger in the proposal is that once we start to tamper with the Department of Justice&rsquo;s budget, which is ring-fenced specifically to ensure that the Treasury does not count it as part of the general Northern Ireland Budget and gives it special treatment, we will open the door for the Treasury to renege on promises that it made on EYF, contingency fund applications, etc?</p>
</speech>

<p>The Minister is quite right. Of the 12 Departments, the Department of Justice is unique in having that special arrangement. The judgement call was made that ring-fencing its budget would be in the Department&rsquo;s best interests over the coming years. It is important to stress that ring-fencing does not mean protection of the budget; the two are distinct concepts. Ring-fencing means that expenditure in the Department of Justice will follow the flows of that of the Home Office in London on justice matters. On balance, it works out that it is in the Department&rsquo;s best interests to pursue that avenue. Ring-fencing is something that people should tamper with only with great discretion, so, given that, I think that the amendment is particularly reckless.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that tomorrow we will have a chance to discuss the Budget in further detail. However, I stress that my party has concerns about the approach that has been taken to the expenditure profile in Northern Ireland in recent years and to what we are seeking to do over the coming years. There is a way that my party will want to make its views known. I fully expect that changes will be made to the draft Budget, which was published in December, when it finally emerges from the Executive in the coming weeks. We are going down the route of having a consultation process. We have to take that process seriously, and a lot of constructive feedback will come through that will need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>I would like to make one comment in response to some of the remarks that Mr Cobain and some SDLP Members made about the Budget being socially unjust. That may be the case, and the level and pace of the cuts coming from the UK Government are certainly having a disproportionate effect on the poorer regions of the UK, including our own. I must say that the four other parties in the Chamber are actually making that situation worse through the populist role that they are playing on the issue of revenue raising. In particular, I identify with people who talk about the Health Service and its need for more money. I identify with them not in a reckless manner that says that more money should be poured into the Health Service, but in a manner that says that pouring money into it can be done sensibly while demanding greater efficiency levels. If people are not prepared to bite the bullet on revenue raising, however, in keeping with what happens in the rest of the UK, they cannot turn around and demand that investment in the Health Service should also follow the same levels as those in the rest of the UK. The two have to be done synchronistically.</p>
<p>I have one other comment to make about revenue raising, and I will make it to see whether the SDLP rises to the bait. Can I welcome the support that the SDLP has given tonight to water charges? That is a very brave step for it to take, given that it is a change of position. Whenever that party talks about the mutualisation of Northern Ireland Water &mdash;</p>

<p>I have no time, unfortunately. The Member can come back to that point.</p>
<p>I happen to agree with the mutualisation of Northern Ireland Water, but the consequences would be that Northern Ireland Water would be self-financing, which means that there would be water charges. Therefore, I welcome that party to reality, given its conversion.</p>
<p>Indeed, the same logic applies to the Ulster Unionist Party, with the exception of its deputy leader. He is the brave man in the party who can talk sense, once in a blue moon. With that, I had better stop.</p>

The Committee has expressed its disappointment at the Department&rsquo;s failure to secure a hardship package for potato and vegetable farmers following the adverse weather conditions that were experienced around this time last year. Indeed, in the lead-up to Christmas, such weather conditions hit the same sector and small sheep farmers in severely disadvantaged areas. The Committee believes that, given the easements that have been made at departmental and Executive level, an intervention could have been made that would have provided a much-needed boost to the sector.</p>
<p>The Vote on Account will obviously introduce the Department into a budgetary period in which it is proposed to relocate the main policy branches from Dundonald House to some, as yet unknown, location outside greater Belfast. I reiterate that the Committee is in favour of the relocation of jobs to outside greater Belfast. However, this is not the time for &ldquo;testing viability&rdquo; or enacting a &ldquo;personal commitment&rdquo;, as the Minister previously indicated. Rather, it is a time for being prudent, as is being asked of the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>The Committee is also concerned about the impact that the transfer of responsibilities from veterinary surgeons to lay testers and the continuation of a failed TB policy will have on animal health in Northern Ireland. It is imperative that the high standards of animal health currently employed in Northern Ireland are maintained, because they go directly to the competitiveness of the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>The Committee is scrutinising and will continue to scrutinise the Department&rsquo;s budget to ensure that money is used in the most efficient and effective manner.</p>

<p>That was brief. Well done.</p>
<p>We must acknowledge that many issues in what we call a Budget debate have still to be addressed and reformed. In many instances, our process is more about dividing resources, particularly when the block grant is interfered with during the Budget period or Programme for Government term. When we are faced with predictable and progressive reductions in the block grant, it becomes all the more difficult to describe this as a Budget process.</p>
<p>However, what emerged during the too-short time frame that we gave ourselves to agree a Budget was that we started to develop procedures that will stand the test of time. The Budget review group, which involves Ministers from each party on the Executive, will address three essential tasks. First, the group will scope out suggestions based on the draft Budget. In doing so, it will examine the proposals from different parties and stakeholders, and advise the Executive accordingly. The group will then move on to examine the revenue-raising proposals, some of which will require legislation and others that can be deployed and developed properly only over a four-year period. The group&rsquo;s third key task is that of examining arm&rsquo;s-length bodies, quangos, etc, and helping to drive out further efficiencies. In circumstances in which we do not have fiscal control, those are, necessarily, the tools that we have to deploy.</p>
<p>Every party had the opportunity to make its input, which is interesting, given the tabling of tonight&rsquo;s completely gratuitous and self-serving amendment. The SDLP was a beneficiary of that process and produced its own economic proposals a week before the publication of the draft document. Obviously, the SDLP had been listening carefully and put its hand up to say: &ldquo;This is nothing to do with us, governor.&rdquo; The SDLP produced its document on the basis of strategic development, which I support and hope will continue to develop. The senior group of Ministers from key Ministries can do a service, and not just for the remaining term of this Assembly. It can lay the groundwork for the successful completion of another term.</p>

<p>I have been watching the SDLP Members, and they are having a ball. If they do not mind, maybe I will not give way. I always enjoy listening, but this business of the SDLP popping up and down is not helping the debate. I would be interested in hearing the SDLP explain the rationale behind its amendment, and it might need as much time as it can get for that.</p>
<p>Let me make just one point, because the SDLP might want to pick up on it. I thought all along, until tonight, that the SDLP was in favour of consultation. SDLP Members may complain about whether enough time was left for the public consultation. I accept that it could have been better. However, the SDLP want to scrub all of that. It tabled an amendment that, if adopted by the Assembly, would rubbish the consultation process. That is a strange position for the SDLP to adopt. I look forward to the SDLP explaining how it will tell people that it does not really want to hear what they have to say and would prefer to dictate, be prescriptive and put it to the Assembly &mdash;</p>

<p>No, sorry. The Member will have his chance to answer when he is called to speak.</p>
<p>Why did the SDLP abandon the idea? Even if it was a truncated consultation period, we still have two more days to go to make the best use of it, but the SDLP does not seem to be interested in seeing that process run its full course. That point should be addressed by the SDLP when it has the opportunity.</p>
<p>Stephen Farry made a very interesting point. I do think that the SDLP has either made a terrible mistake or it has, in fact, signalled a change in direction. The initiative that it is suggesting leads inevitably towards the introduction of water charges. Let me say for my party &mdash;</p>

<p>No, sorry, I have already explained why I am not giving any more ground to the SDLP. Members from that party have had and will have ample opportunity to explain themselves.</p>
<p>Our position is that we will go before the electorate on 5 May, and we will defend our political position and our political decision. We took a decision. We listened to all the naysayers and the wise pundits who tell us to introduce water charges. Everyone knows that, even if the Assembly acceded to that, it would not go anywhere near to addressing the deficit caused by the decision that was taken at Westminster to take &pound;4 billion out of the Executive&rsquo;s funding.</p>
<p>So we have to address the question of it driving out further efficiencies. We have an inescapable duty to address the question of devising revenue-raising funding so that we can help to bridge the gap. Four billion pounds is a very significant challenge, one that requires all parties to pull their weight. There must be no semi-detached parties &mdash; the SDLP used to be very critical of the DUP in that regard &mdash; in the Executive. Parties are either in the Executive or they are not.</p>

<p>As the Vote on Account 2011-12 foreshadows and includes elements of year 1 of the Department of Education&rsquo;s expenditure in the context of Budget 2010, it is only right that a number of issues are laid before the House. We are in a situation in which we will face difficulties in the delivery of service because of the current structure of the financial settlement.</p>
<p>I note the Department of Education elements of the Vote on Account on page 2 of the paper before the House. On 31 January 2011, during a debate on the take-note motion on the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget, I reported to the House that the Committee for Education was awaiting the draft spending proposals from the Minister and that some Committee members had serious concerns that the Department&rsquo;s draft Budget document contained little information on how the proposed savings would be achieved and on the actual impact of savings, particularly in relation to front line services. There can be no service in education that is more front line than the classroom. That is where we will see the impact of what is really going to happen as regards education. We can talk about restructuring and various arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. We can have ideas about how we can do things more efficiently. However, it behoves us all, irrespective of the political ideology that we aspire to and regardless of the differences that we had in relation to how we got here, to give serious consideration to what the impact will be.</p>
<p>Let me put it in context: I do not think that any Member will be able to escape dealing with the consequences in their local area. It will not be enough just to say that it was one party or another that was responsible; it will ultimately be the judgement of the people of Northern Ireland that we were collectively responsible for delivering the reductions that challenge our education system.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Committee still awaits spending proposals and the essential information on those proposals. We will meet again tomorrow to discuss the issues further in relation to the draft Budget. It is very difficult, if not nigh impossible, for any scrutiny Committee of the House to provide substantive views to any Minister when there is a lack of clarity &mdash; not on what is proposed to be saved but on what is actually proposed to be spent.</p>
<p>However, on the basis of the information that is available, the Committee did provide an interim response on the Budget to the Finance and Personnel Committee, as requested, on 28 January. It is available for Members to view on the Committee&rsquo;s web page. I want to highlight an important element of that response as regards a savings proposal that is of concern to the Committee: the aggregate schools budget. That is the money that goes directly to fund our schools and classrooms. The saving in year 1 &mdash; 2011-12 &mdash; is almost &pound;27 million. It builds up to a colossal &pound;184 million in year 4 of the Budget period. That is almost one fifth of the cuts to the school budget. We might all ask how that sits with the Minister&rsquo;s admirable desire to ensure that front line services are protected. If we are to have such an attack on the aggregate budget, which pays for the teachers, the heat and the lighting &mdash; as core as front line funding can get &mdash; then that gives us some sense of how this Budget will challenge us all.</p>

<p>Does the Member accept that early years education is vital if young people across Northern Ireland are to achieve the attainment levels that we are all aiming for &mdash; particularly in Protestant schools, as well? Significantly less money is provided here. It is &pound;2,000 per child in Britain and &pound;630 per child in Northern Ireland. The Minister of Education tells us that early years funding will be protected within her budget, but there is no information on where it is going to be spent. Does the Member agree that there is worry and concern in the voluntary sector and among schools about where this early years provision is going to come from?</p>

<p>The Member makes a valid point. This is where we all have to realise that the rhetoric must meet and match the reality. The difficulty with the Budget as it currently sits is that the rhetoric is not meeting the reality of the finances, either in the current draft or in what will ultimately be published as the final piece of work. The Member makes a valid point in relation to early years. I am concerned &mdash; speaking as a Member, not as Chairperson &mdash; that we are seeing what has been referred to by other members of the Committee as a situation where early years as an overarching representative group is being divided. The Member will be aware that we have statutory provision and voluntary and community provision.</p>
<p class="italic">The report of the remainder of this day&rsquo;s sitting will be published on 15 February 2011.</p>
