<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-06-13.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90097" speakername="Mr Eamonn ONeill" speakeroffice="The Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000613.htm#1">
<p class="small">That this Assembly calls upon the appropriate broadcast licensing authorities to facilitate United Christian Broadcasters in their use of unused AM frequencies.</p>
<p>The Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee received representations from United Christian Broadcasters UCB. Having deliberated on the matter at some length, we felt that it would be significant and important to bring this motion before the House by way of support. As you are aware, Mr&nbsp;Speaker, this is not a devolved matter. However, the Committee takes it so seriously, on the basis that it involves a simple, fundamental human right, that we felt it necessary to bring it to the attention of the House and inveigle Members into giving their support so as to strengthen the case for relieving what we consider to be an injustice.</p>
<p>Who are UCB? They are an international and interdenominational charity &mdash; and I would stress the interdenominational aspect of their work, since in our country this can be an interesting subject. They cross all community groups and have representation from all organised Christian religions. They have offices in Belfast, Dublin and various other parts of the world. Their European studios are located in Stoke-on-Trent, and they have large support in Britain and Ireland. They can count on 270,000 people who would petition to support them. Some 30,000 are from Northern Ireland, and 10,000 are from the Republic.</p>
<p>Yesterday I received a petition signed by 27,000 people in support of UCB&rsquo;s request for fair treatment. I have examined the box of petitions, and I understand they were examined by the Minister responsible in the Dáil, who instructed her officials to spend three days going through them &mdash; much to their satisfaction. I do not have that time or those resources. However, from what I can see, they are clearly a very representative set of petition seekers.</p>
<p>The UCB radio station began in the 1980s when the present managing director, Mr&nbsp;Gareth&nbsp;Littler, campaigned in Parliament to bring about freedom for Christian radio.</p>
<p>He petitioned Parliament with 273,000 signatures &mdash; and succeeded in obtaining a satellite licence. Unfortunately, however, a clause was added to the Broadcasting Act to exclude any religious body from broadcasting nationally. The Minister responsible for the Act was Mr&nbsp;David&nbsp;Mellor, whom, I am sure, many in the House remember well. His action was never debated on the Floor of the House of Commons. In other words, the insertion of that clause, which has prevented Christian music radio stations from obtaining a licence to broadcast on ordinary radio ever since, was a unilateral act of the Minister.</p>
<p>Of course, this has a particular impact in Northern Ireland, where, as we know, there is a very keen interest in Christian music. UCB began broadcasting in May&nbsp;1993, on satellite, and it continues to do so. However, in 1997 it was refused even an application for a licence. It is not even allowed to apply for a licence because of the 1990 and the more recent 1996 Broadcasting Acts. This law is exclusive, discriminatory and needs to be changed.</p>
<p>Christians are being excluded from broadcasting, and as a result UCB took legal action and advice from Baker&nbsp;and&nbsp;MacKenzie, a top law firm in London. David&nbsp;Pannick&nbsp;QC, one of the most highly respected barristers in Britain, gave the opinion that the refusal to give the UCB an application form for a radio licence was a breach of the rights given to all under the Human Rights Convention, and a denial of freedom of expression, freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination. In the Good Friday Agreement, in the section entitled &quot;Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity&quot;, the parties affirmed</p>
<p class="small">&quot;the right to freedom and expression of religion;<br /> the right to pursue democratically, national and political aspirations;<br /> the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of ... creed&quot;.</p>
<p>This action by UCB is continuing through the European Court of Human Rights, and the outcome is awaited.</p>
<p>It is also important to point out that the BBC seeks to retain its monopoly on religious broadcasting nationally, while it clearly has no plans to provide a 24-hour specialist Christian radio music station. The lack of such a station presents some difficulties. I will try to outline some of them. Over the years both the BBC and ITV have drastically cut the time allocated to religious broadcasting. ITV companies give an average of only 2% of the available broadcasting hours per week. Last year, BBC1 did not have a Christmas Day service and there is no indication that there will be any improvement in this respect.</p>
<p>There are also concerns about quality. While some religious programmes have clearly been excellent, many have not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-06-13.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90099" speakername="Mr Ian Paisley Jnr" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000613.htm#1">
<p>Does the Member accept that, while the BBC does from time to time neglect its public duty, it provides many good religious programmes &mdash; for instance, Steve&nbsp;Stockman&rsquo;s radio programme on a Sunday evening, &lsquo;Songs of Praise&rsquo; on BBC television and &lsquo;Sunday Sequence&rsquo;, which provides a wide range of thought-provoking religious ideas? We can be hard on the BBC from time to time, but it still provides that service.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-06-13.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90097" speakername="Mr Eamonn ONeill" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000613.htm#1">
<p>I accept what Mr&nbsp;Paisley says. When he intervened I was saying that, while some religious programmes have been excellent &mdash; and, as he has done, we can name them &mdash; others have not been particularly helpful to the Christian faith. There has been a tendency to trivialise it, and some have even blended Christianity with such things as witchcraft. There is therefore a question about the standard as well as the frequency of religious programming.</p>
<p>The 1996 agreement between the Government and the BBC, and the Broadcasting Act 1996 simply expanded the 1990 national religious disqualification to include local digital licences. This ensured that there would be no future competition for the state broadcaster&rsquo;s national religious monopoly. It could be argued that this breaks competition law.</p>
<p>That Northern Ireland has been affected already is demonstrated by the way in which the UCB&rsquo;s requests for an application for the recently advertised local digital radio licence was treated. In April the radio authority refused the UCB access to a Northern Ireland licence and, as I said earlier, would not even provide an application form. There is no Christian music radio station in Northern&nbsp;Ireland today. Such a service is banned by the combined forces of the BBC and the UK Government. It is not that there is a shortage of frequencies or an inability to provide programming. Atheists are not being told that there is a shortage of frequencies for them. This is straightforward, unfortunate discrimination against Christians, and the total ban on religious groups still applies. Up to 200 digital licences are being made available around the United Kingdom, but none of them can be for a Christian music station.</p>
<p>When one looks at it in that particular light, one can see, as I said at the outset, that there is a basic point of principle at stake here about freedom. There is also a question of standards in Christian broadcasting stations, and one fear often expressed about Christian radio stations perhaps arises from some of the abuses that may have occurred in the United States with the exploitative, televangelist approach.</p>
<p>I should like to assure the House that there are safeguards in that very same Broadcasting Act 1990 which would control the quality of any Christian radio station. There are three in particular to which I draw Members&rsquo; attention. Ownership by fit and proper persons is dealt with in Part III, section 86(4)(a). Responsible programming which does not exploit is dealt with in Part III, section 90(1) and 90(2). In addition, under Part I, 4(1)(a) of the 1996 Act, authorities may impose additional licensing conditions as they deem necessary. These three sections would provide direct control over such radio stations and should assure those who may have concerns about the exploitative nature of certain broadcasting companies they may have come across in America.</p>
<p>Following the UCB submission to Members on 9 March 1999, 85% of the Members from our ranks have signed in support, and I expect that support may have grown somewhat since. This is a reflection of the very point I made at the beginning, that people recognise this as a denial of a basic and fundamental human right. It is also interesting to note that 88·88% of MPs in Northern Ireland &mdash; and I do not know how that figure was arrived at &mdash; have also signed up in support of it.</p>
<p>In the Republic of Ireland, as I said earlier, the Minister for Broadcasting, Síle de Valera, in a speech in the Dáil, acknowledged the need for a licensing regime for the United Christian Broadcasters&rsquo; radio station. There is, therefore, a strong case to be answered here, and the Committee is asking that the House approve this motion. A case can then be put to those people who allocate licenses to illustrate that we have major concerns about this denial of what we describe as a basic human right, and we can ask them to reconsider their views with regard to Christian broadcasting in general.</p>

<p>The Business Committee decided that this debate could run for two hours. Given the substantial number of Members who wish to speak, I can allow only five minutes for each and then 15 minutes for the proposer&rsquo;s winding-up speech.</p>

<p>I thank Mr ONeill and his Committee for bringing forward this important motion. I also thank him for the very detailed statement he has made this morning. I will not be repeating any of it.</p>
<p>I fully support today&rsquo;s motion that the appropriate broadcasting licensing authority be asked to facilitate the United Christian Broadcasters and allow them to broadcast on unused AM frequencies. What have we to lose by supporting this motion? There is an opportunity to provide twenty-four hour Christian broadcasting for those who want it and all the existing stations and programmes for those who do not. In a broadly Christian country it seems ridiculous that independent ethnic radio stations have air space, while a Christian radio station cannot find the space to provide a valuable service to the people. The irony is that the Russian federation has given the United Christian Broadcasters access to four AM frequencies previously used for propaganda, yet the United Kingdom Government will not remove the legal obstacles. Throughout the world, Ireland is referred to as the Land of saints and scholars. I am sure we all claim to have high Christian and moral values. It is therefore imperative that the United Christian Broadcasters be granted the necessary licence and facilities so that they can reinforce Christian values among the general public. I ask all in the Chamber to fully support this important motion.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-06-13.1.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90110" speakername="Mr Jim Shannon" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000613.htm#1">
<p>I endorse the comments that have been put forward. This issue concerns many of us, and all members of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee endorsed the proposal. Constituents have contacted us about it, and therefore it is important that we discuss it today. The UCB put their case to Assembly Members some 18 months ago, and a concerted campaign has been operating ever since. The matter was brought before the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee by those with a particular interest in it, and as a result of the representations that were made to us 85% of MLAs signed the motion. It is interesting that a majority of MPs have done likewise. This shows that among the political parties in this Chamber there is a united front. There is a desire to make sure that this issue be brought to the fore and that the Government respond positively to it.</p>
<p>The ban on the UCB is totally discriminating. It affects all sections of the community, and all feel aggrieved. The ban on religious ownership of the national radio stations in the United Kingdom is contained in the Broadcasting Act 1990. As a direct result of that &mdash; and I know that my Colleague has mentioned some of the BBC&rsquo;s efforts &mdash; the BBC has a monopoly on religious broadcasting nationally. This is before the European Court of Human Rights, where the matter will be decided. There is an issue to be addressed: the BBC should not have the monopoly of all national religious broadcasting.</p>
<p>We were urged at the time to write to Janet&nbsp;Anderson, the Minister responsible. We have not received a response, which is disappointing, for that is what the people want. Only independent specialist Christian radio stations can meet the unfilled request, and the UCB could do just that. The number of people who have written on this issue to Assembly Members, to our Members of Parliament and to the councils is enormous. Indeed, in the Dáil there are moves afoot to make sure that there will be changes there.</p>
<p>Changes in legislation are important and something we wish to see. We do not have power in the Assembly to make those changes; that power lies in London.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom law is out of step with almost all of Europe and even with north and south America. We have all received a chart that shows all the countries where UCB stations and private stations can tell their different stories in music and in word. But there is a gap. Cuba, a country with a very strict regime, has a radio licence facility, as do the Eastern bloc countries, Switzerland, the United States and Argentina. Some of these countries we have not got on well with in the past. The United Kingdom is the one country that is out of step, out of tune and, some would say, out of frequency with the rest of Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The people who benefit from UCB are numerous, especially in rural areas. For many who live in rural parts of Northern Ireland, the only contact with the outside world is through radio. It is important that that thirst for Christian radio and music can be quenched. The UCB, as it has shown in other parts of the world, can present a programme of Christian radio &mdash; music, verse and word &mdash; to those who listen to and use Christian religious programmes.</p>
<p>At present people can get these programmes through satellite and cable television. They cater for some 300,000 people, but not for everyone. Not everyone has a satellite dish or can receive cable television.</p>
<p>Broadcasting can, and indeed does, show many immoral practices. The balance that is needed is not there. The UCB has adopted the very same guidelines that the BBC once had for religious broadcasting as a basis for all its work. The UCB is not operating and giving a service in Northern Ireland purely and simply because of the BBC and the United Kingdom Government.</p>
<p>There must be controls so that cults and other religions can be responsible. The UCB has met the demands that have been made, and it is important that that is said as well. Recent newspaper reports have highlighted chronic depression as the reason for the fact that many young people commit suicide. That shows the need for the UCB radio station&rsquo;s uplifting and life-changing message of reconciliation. The Minister in London needs to change the law and remove this discrimination urgently. The alternative is to devolve responsibility for broadcasting licences to the Assembly.</p>

<p>A LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom, ag labhairt ar son Sinn Féin, tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. On behalf of Sinn Féin, I want to support the motion in principle. We all appreciate the strength of the UCB&rsquo;s lobby.</p>
<p>UCB&rsquo;s lobby is very highly motivated and obviously well resourced. That group has spoken to many Assembly Members individually and has written to everyone. TDs in other parts of the country have also been lobbied.</p>
<p>My party&rsquo;s support for the motion should come as no surprise, given our direct experience of censorship &mdash; of having our voice suppressed, access to the airwaves denied and actors&rsquo; voices substituted for ours in the past which no doubt, provided work for Equity. We all know that censorship does not work. Section 31 did not work with RTÉ in the Twenty-Six Counties, nor did its application in the North. Exclusion from the broadcast media was a very undemocratic experience for our party. It was wrong, unjust and unfair, and we would not seek to impose such censorship on United Christian Broadcasters. Essentially, we see this as a human rights issue, which is relevant to the equality agenda, as legislated for in the new era of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
<p>As a party, Sinn Féin has consistently championed the right of all people to freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of speech and freedom from discrimination. Not surprisingly, neither I nor any other member of Sinn Féin holds any brief for UCB as an organisation. However, it is appropriate to invoke article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which cites the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Obviously, it is correct and legitimate to outline some of the responsibilities that automatically accompany rights in this matter. We all have our own concerns about programme content and the need to avoid the denigration of other religions. I assume that UCB has no intention of going down that road, but I want to make the point that we all have our individual preferences with regard to a more ecumenical inclusive approach that reflects the diversity of religions. We can seek assurances about accepted guidelines and standards, but when someone supports something in principle, it is more about the principle than about the content.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we support the motion in principle. Early this morning I listened to the tape &mdash; &quot;A Gift from God&quot; &mdash; which was presented to us by UCB. It begins</p>
<p class="small">&quot;It is 6.25 am; what a beautiful morning to wake up to God.&quot;</p>
<p>I asked a friend of mine yesterday for his views, and he quoted a very popular song:</p>
<p class="small">&quot;All God&rsquo;s creatures have a place in the choir.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a nice sentiment. From Sinn Féin&rsquo;s point of view, that includes the Rev William McCrea.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-06-13.1.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90015" speakername="Dr Esmond Birnie" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000613.htm#1">
<p>It will be hard to follow that last point.</p>
<p>In this House we often face difficult issues of competing principles, one of which is the allocation of public money. It is very hard to identify the principle that could be held to oppose this motion. Moreover, there is no commitment for spending public money on it. It requires support because it is an issue of freedom, human rights and religious tolerance. As such, UCB&rsquo;s campaign has received widespread public support, and, as the Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee said, it has received widespread cross-party support in the Assembly. It seems that UCB has fallen victim to the Broadcasting Act 1990, schedule 2, in particular, and we wonder why that schedule was included. The Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee suggested that that schedule owed much to the exaggerated fears of the then Minister, David&nbsp;Mellor, about the potential invasion of the United Kingdom media by the grosser aspects of United States-style televangelism.</p>
<p>Those fears were almost certainly misplaced to begin with, and did not justify what was a gross limitation on freedom and religious tolerance. It will be objected that if permission is given to an exclusively Christian broadcaster, Islamic stations, for example, will inevitably follow. There are two responses to that. First, if one takes a strong view on religious liberty, one will not wish to stop Islamic broadcasting. In any case, it will happen under provisions for racial equality and so forth. There is no technical limitation on broadcasting by UCB. As I understand it, the AM frequencies are available.</p>
<p>In his opening speech, the Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee rightly said that there is a high level of public support for this type of motion. As Mr Shannon said, it is an upsetting situation when many other countries such as Slovakia and Argentina, which have not hitherto been regarded as paragons of liberalism, now have better freedom of religious broadcasting legislation than the United Kingdom. There seems to be progress on changing UCB&rsquo;s position in the Republic of Ireland, which I welcome, and also in Europe under the European Convention on Human Rights. I appeal to the United Kingdom authorities not to be found wanting. I urge the House to support the motion.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-06-13.1.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90068" speakername="Mr Alban Maginness" time="11:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000613.htm#1">
<p>This is a matter of freedom of speech &mdash; indeed, of freedom of religion. When one examines the statutory basis of the ban on religious ownership of national radio stations in the UK and religious broadcasting, one wonders why such a restriction was imposed in the first place. It is difficult to say. There was no real debate at Westminster on this particular aspect of the Broadcasting Act 1990. Perhaps it was not intended to have this effect. If that were so, UCB would have an easier path, but I suspect that that was not the position. The real suspicion is that the BBC wishes to hold on to its monopoly of religious broadcasting. That is the stumbling block. We should send a strong message to the BBC and to Westminster that we disagree profoundly with this ban &mdash; that we see it as a very serious infringement of religious freedom and freedom of speech; that we do not believe that a large, powerful organisation funded exclusively by the public should enjoy such a monopoly over an area of great sensitivity that deeply affects many people.</p>
<p>If the 1990 Act was bad, the Broadcasting Act 1996 was even worse. The 1996 Act extends the ban to include local digital licences. That is clearly unacceptable. There should not have been an extension of this ban. As Mr&nbsp;ONeill, the Chairman of the Committee, said, the UCB requested a form of application for a recently advertised local digital radio licence but was refused. That is a matter for great regret.</p>
<p>I welcome this debate, which is of great service to the House and to the community in general. It raises the questions about the sort of devolution that we want. One is beginning to realise, having experienced the supply debate yesterday, that there are restrictions in relation to devolution in terms of monetary issues and in the raising of public funds for all our public bodies. We now realise that we are restricted even in terms of broadcasting. It would be useful if the Government were to consider extending the ability of the Administration here to grant broadcasting licences. Surely, granting licences would come under our capable purview, and is something that we should be seeking from the Westminster Government.</p>
<p>There is a much more sympathetic attitude in the Republic. The Minister responsible for broadcasting matters, Síle de Valera, has said that she will amend the legislation in the Republic of Ireland in order to permit UCB to broadcast. That is progressive and should be welcomed. The decision contrasts sharply with the current policy of the Westminster Administration.</p>
<p>UCB is currently confined to the more heavenly sphere of satellite broadcasting. However, I am reliably informed that it would be happy to add to its heavenly operation a more earthly role as a terrestrial broadcaster.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-06-13.1.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90021" speakername="Mr Mervyn Carrick" time="11:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000613.htm#1">
<p>I speak in support of the motion. United Christian Broadcasters has experienced frustration in its attempts to overcome apparent discrimination to establish freedom of expression. I believe that it is my duty in the Assembly to ensure that this organisation receives equality of treatment and the right to freedom of expression. We need to overcome the national monopoly held by the BBC.</p>
<p>On the subject of equality of treatment, there can be no justification for the continuing stance taken by the broadcasting authorities to hinder the issue of a licence to United Christian Broadcasters. I come from a Christian background &mdash; Christian in the biblical sense: one who is justified by faith alone, reached by redeeming love and saved by Christ&rsquo;s matchless grace. Biblically, I take the name &quot;Christian&quot; based upon the absolute supremacy of the word of Christ, the sufficiency of the work of Christ and the superiority of the way of Christ.</p>
<p>Section 75 of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Act 1998 demands equality of opportunity and Christians should not be discriminated against, or hindered in the proclamation of the Christian message or the word of God. There are many differences of emphasis in worship. Indeed, there is an ecumenical interpretation that I do not agree with, but, whatever one&rsquo;s beliefs, the principle of equality of opportunity is still valid.</p>
<p>The continual rejection by the broadcasting authorities to deny UCB an application to broadcast gospel music is unacceptable. The creation of a level playing field, to include the right of Christians to promote the Christian gospel in word and music, is imperative.</p>
<p>This brings me to the second principle &mdash; the right to freedom of expression. We live in an age where we have witnessed the decline of moral standards and values. The expression of this downgrade is no more evident than in the broadcasting industry, whether it be on television or radio. All sorts of deviant behaviour and perverted values are represented regularly in the media.</p>
<p>Without a blush, without a pang of conscience, and without a thought for the consequences, all sorts of vulgarities, obscenities and lewd activities are portrayed and conveyed through the media. How much more vital is it then for a Christian message to be available to the populace, when they eventually realise that the wantonness of this pleasure-seeking, depraved world is failing them? It is essential for the moral good of our people that the right of Christians to bring a message of hope, love, compassion, life and, indeed, eternal life be upheld in a world that is lying in the lap of iniquity. To restrict the freedom of expression for Christians is to deny to a needy world the one sure solution to all its problems. Christ is the answer.</p>
<p>We may differ culturally and religiously. Socially we may move in different circles and hold different political perspectives. However, the Christian gospel message is one that concerns all cultural, social and political views, for in it Christ states</p>
<p class="small">&quot;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore it is important that the United Christian Broadcasters, and others like-minded, be afforded the right to use the airwaves to convey this message of all messages &mdash; that Christ loves the world of sinners lost and ruined by the fall, and salvation he offers free to all.</p>
<p>Finally, as an Assembly, Members should seek to expose and oppose the anti-competitive process of the national monopoly relating to religious broadcasting. The contemporary gospel music broadcast by UCB reflects and proclaims the faith of the Church, as found in the Bible and the living traditions and preaching of the visible Christian Church.</p>

<p>A LeasCheann Comhairle. I rise to support the motion although having listened to what Mervyn&nbsp;Carrick said, which had a touch of the zealot about it, I have some feeling of reservation because to be too zealous in religious terms can be dangerous. However, I support the motion because as far as the BBC is concerned, there has been too much of a broadcasting monopoly over the years. We have been tied too much by the monopoly under the Broadcasting Act on all aspects, but particularly in relation to religion.</p>
<p>I enjoy, as much as anyone, listening to religious programmes. Indeed, just last night I turned on RTÉ, and Hans Küng was on. Hans Küng has been silenced by the Catholic Church for giving expression to what it terms radical views in relation to Christianity. So it was good to be able to listen to someone like Hans Küng. Had it not been for RTÉ, and its use of the airwaves, we might not have heard a different view of Catholicism from a man who is an ordained priest, a Catholic and a theologian. It therefore has advantages. Rights carry with them responsibility. There is no right without responsibility. We have to be conscious of our responsibilities in relation to these matters, and the airwaves should not be used to insult, by any word or act, another religion, whether Muslim, Hindu, Catholic, Protestant or Presbyterian. I am sure that the United Christian Broadcasters are conscious of this.</p>
<p>We have to be conscious of our responsibilities in relation to broadcasting, and particularly our Christian broadcasting.</p>
<p>My Colleague Mr McElduff mentioned article 9, but article 10 refers to the rights to freedom of expression, freedom to hold opinions and freedom to receive and impart information. Those are all important, particularly in terms of our religious input into society. How is it approached? How do we deal with it, given all the sensitivities involved?</p>
<p>I agree with Mr&nbsp;Carrick, that day and daily, our lives and homes are invaded by the most materialistic of considerations. Yet no one cries out, calls for a ban or seeks to suppress advertising that in many ways causes hardship to families, particularly advertising that is aimed at young people and children and, given the enticements involved, puts parents under a great deal of stress. Perhaps because there is too much money involved no one wants to ban or restrict advertising. Yet when we come to a Christian message, we find this embargo. Maybe that speaks volumes about attitudes in the new millennium to Christianity in general.</p>
<p>In principle, I support the motion.</p>
<p>I will finish by echoing Mr&nbsp;McElduff. What about a cross-community choir with an opportunity to sing from the same hymn sheet? There are two Testaments, the Old Testament and the New Testament. I like to think that we will be concentrating, by and large, on the New Testament.</p>

<p>It is a delight to hear such a united voice in the Chamber this morning. Long may that continue. As the Alliance Party&rsquo;s representative on the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee, I fully support the efforts of the UCB to get a licence from the licensing authority and the United Kingdom Government to broadcast Christian music throughout these islands.</p>
<p>It is to the eternal shame of the broadcasting authority that it has continually refused a licence to enable the UCB to provide a service to a very wide and appreciative audience. What is it afraid of? It is often said that we live in a Christian society. If that is the case, surely it must follow that every effort be made to promote the Christian way of life. And what better way to do that than to offer a variety of Christian broadcasts in the form of music, praise and worship? There must be space for everyone.</p>
<p>The Alliance Party has always supported freedom of choice. Here we are being denied that freedom, for whatever reason. It is to be hoped that after today&rsquo;s debate the attitude of the authority will change. The Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee has welcomed the fact that the Dublin authorities have recently acknowledged the need for a licence to be given to the UCB so that local Christian music can be available to all who wish to hear it. There is also an economic benefit to be gained by local Irish artists who will have the airwaves to advance their musical talents.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the Christian music of the UCB has brought, and will continue to bring, great comfort, peace and reconciliation to many people. It must be our prayer and hope today that the Government will grant the necessary licence without delay. I fully support the motion.</p>

<p>I have no intention of following the first Sinn Féin contributor to the debate, who used the motion as a political platform and whose comments were absolutely reprehensible. The ban on Sinn Féin/IRA that existed in both the United Kingdom and the Republic was not a denial of human rights; it was there to prevent an organisation that literally murdered Protestants in their place of worship and murdered a young Catholic girl coming from her place of worship from using the broadcasting media as a means of legitimising its foul, murderous activity.</p>
<p>UCB is a highly professional broadcasting organisation, licensed since 1993 to broadcast &mdash;</p>

<p>I will not give way.</p>
<p>It has been licensed since 1993 to broadcast via the Astra satellite. UCB is a registered charity run by 50 full-time staff and hundreds of volunteers. It operates two round-the-clock music radio stations. UCB Europe presents praise, worship and easy-listening music, Bible readings and factual programmes for adults. UCB Cross Rhythms presents contemporary gospel music for young people.</p>
<p>The breakdown of UCB output is 70% Christian music and 30% speech-based material, made up of Christian testimonies, interviews, Bible readings, phone-ins and competitions. Contemporary Christian music is the fastest growing genre of music in the world, and UCB gospel music broadcasts reflect and proclaim the faith of the church as it is found in the Bible and in the living traditions and teachings of the visible Christian churches. This type of gospel music is virtually unrepresented in the programming of the BBC and independent local radio stations. This means that there is a very large demand for the type of Christian music provided by UCB &mdash; a demand that is not being met by the BBC.</p>
<p>UCB&rsquo;s problem is that under the 1990 Broadcasting Act it is not permitted access to a national radio frequency, and this ban was extended to local digital radio under the 1996 Broadcasting Act. That legislation effectively represents lobbying by the BBC for a monopoly of national religious broadcasting. This monopoly is entirely unacceptable at the very time that the technical advance into digital is opening up the opportunity for a great diversity of broadcasting. Responsible Christian broadcasting represented by an organisation such as UCB must be permitted to be part of that diversity. This is not intended as an adverse comment on the BBC&rsquo;s religious broadcasting. It is simply to make the case that religious broadcasting should not be effectively monopolised by one broadcasting organisation.</p>
<p>There is no Christian music radio in Northern Ireland today because it is banned as a result of the 1990 and 1996 legislation. The people of Northern Ireland are being disadvantaged by the UK&rsquo;s secular regulators. This is absolutely unacceptable. The unacceptability of the situation has been recently highlighted by William Hague. He said to an audience of about 8,000 people at this year&rsquo;s spring harvest Bible camp in April</p>
<p class="small">&quot;It is unacceptable that a glass ceiling has been placed over the vision of Christian broadcasters like Premier in London and United Christian Broadcasters. With so much material on television that no parent would want their children to see, we must give a full opportunity for Christians to put forward exciting and wholesome alternatives. The next Conservative Government will ensure that Christians have the same right to national and digital licences as anyone else.&quot;</p>
<p>The point about the unsuitable material on television was well made by Mr Carrick.</p>
<p>The vote today will set the precedent for change. The NIUP supports absolutely the right of UCB to have the access that it requires to make use of unused AM frequencies. We support the motion.</p>

<p>The history of Christian music in Ireland in general, and in Ulster in particular, is both interesting and of profound importance in the development of both European and world civilisations. I am particularly glad that Éamonn ONeill has brought this motion before us, he being an O&rsquo;Neill and Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee.</p>
<p>In the early monasteries of Ireland hymnology was central to worship. Two of the most important monasteries were Movilla and Bangor. In the sixth century many of the great scholars and saints of Ireland were educated in one or other of them. Columba, who was of the house of the O&rsquo;Neill, studied under St Finnian at Movilla, and Comgall of Bangor helped him in his work among the Picts of Alba &mdash; what we now know as Scotland.</p>
<p>In 563 Columba founded the great religious centre of Iona, which was to become the cultural apotheosis of Scotland. The followers of Columba were composed of all the peoples of Ireland, united in religion. From the Bangor monastery were also to come Columbanus, who founded Luxeuil in France and Bobbio in Italy, and St Gall, who founded a monastery and canton of that name in Switzerland. These were to be the chief centres of scholarship and religion that brought Europe, at last, out of the Dark Ages. The glory of these monks was the celebration of a perfected and refined <i>Laus Perennis</i>, which is Latin for perennial praise, and in singing this hymnology and psalmody continuously, day and night, they entered into a covenant of mutual love and service in the Church of Jesus Christ. Their singing has not been equalled.</p>
<p>Later in Ireland we had the development of the people who became known as the Ulster-Scots. In America they were known as the Scotch-Irish. Following their emigrations to America they merged quickly into the American nation, although the Ulster speech itself was to stay alive in the hill country of Appalachia and beyond, where Scotch-Irish traditional music may still be heard. Among the earliest songs were ballads of King William of Orange, so that those who sang them became known as the Billy-boys of the hill country, or hill-billies.</p>
<p>Rooted deep in the traditions of the British Isles peasantry, traditional music themes came to reinforce the ancient cultural divide between north and west Britain and Ireland, and south and east Britain. Transposed to America, therefore, Christian music reached the peak of its development in the southern states. Musicologist W H Williams has written</p>
<p class="small">&quot;Ireland&rsquo;s initial impact upon American music came predominantly from Ulster&hellip; Whatever their influence in terms of cabin and barn styles&hellip;town planning, and so on, it seems likely that the greatest and most lasting contribution of the Scotch-Irish [or Ulster-Scots] was music. And however one may define their particular religious and ethnic identity, musically they should be considered Ulstermen, for they brought with them [that particular] mixture of Scottish and Irish tunes which is still characteristic of large parts of Northern Ireland. When the great English folklorist Cecil Sharp went into the Appalachians to rediscover &lsquo;English&rsquo; folk song, he was in fact dealing with people of Ulster descent.&quot;</p>
<p>The centre of Christian music in the United States of America is now Nashville, Tennessee. Of course, this is the epicentre of Scotch-Irish emigration and development. Therefore, in supporting this motion, I look to the cultural aspects of it, and I feel that the United Christian Broadcasters have done us a great service in promoting Christian music again throughout the world and in Ireland and Ulster in particular.</p>

<p>My lecture in history does not go back quite as far as Ian Adamson&rsquo;s. I want to talk about the pirate radio station Radio Caroline. Older Members of the Assembly &mdash; and I must exclude Paul&nbsp;Berry &mdash; will recall that Radio Caroline, the pirate radio station, was broadcast from a ship anchored on the high seas, because the Government wanted to keep control of radio and did not relish the idea of people outside their influence making decisions about what was broadcast.</p>
<p>In those days it was not Christian music that was the problem but pop music. Today the debate continues, but much progress has been made since the day that the arresting party boarded the ship and closed poor Caroline down, robbing us of one of the most popular radio stations ever to occupy the airwaves.</p>
<p>I believe that we have come a long way since then, and I have no doubt that Radio Caroline influenced much of what is happening today. Today we have talk radio, rock radio and classical radio. Apart from the BBC and other national stations, we have some of the best local radio providers, and all of them are meeting the needs of their listeners.</p>
<p>Radio has truly experienced a revival and all thanks to a challenge from that pirate radio station all those years ago. In a way it seems strange that the broadcasting of Christian music remains the one specialist area that has yet to be reformed. People will want to listen to music inspired by the Christian message. They cannot have their station, and that must surely be wrong. I understand the concerns of Government. They have a responsibility to ensure that such a facility is not hijacked by people who have abused the word of God in the past for their own ends, often adding to people&rsquo;s agony rather than inspiring the true Christian message. That may be the fear of Government, but surely it is possible to put standards and controls in place which ensure that the privilege of broadcasting Christian music, and messages, is not hijacked by the ungodly.</p>
<p>I am convinced that this sensitive issue can be handled in a way which will enable those who get comfort from listening to music, inspired by messages of Christian love, to enjoy such a service. Therefore it seems bizarre that in a world driven by an unprecedented craze for communication and information there is still a ban on setting up a Christian music station. Notwithstanding the fear that it would be used and abused, surely it is possible to present a united front on this issue and call for the Government to issue a licence. I believe we should do that, while making it clear that such a service would have to reflect a broad Christian message inspired by a genuine desire to bring solace and comfort to the many people who have placed their spiritual welfare in the message of Christianity.</p>
<p>Pardon the pun, but I believe we have enough faith in each other to accept that the days when the Russians used radio for propaganda purposes are gone. Indeed, it is ironic that UCB have got permission from the new Russian Government to utilise AM channels formerly used by the previous Communist regime.</p>
<p>In asking for choice, there is no suggestion that the BBC and other providers of Christian radio programmes will not continue to make a vital contribution in this important field. Indeed, I wish to put on record my appreciation and that of the SDLP for the programmes which have been broadcast on a daily and weekly basis by the BBC and other established broadcasters. Their role in this field will continue, please God. The monopoly on Christian broadcasting is a serious infringement of human rights, and I understand that a case is currently being considered by the International Court of Human Rights. Why should we wait until a decision is made? Let the Government be certain that they can using existing legislation to ensure that only fit persons, as defined in the Broadcasting Act, can qualify for licences. Using the Broadcasting Act, the Government can ensure that the rights to broadcast are not exploited, and there is provision to impose additional licence conditions as the Government deems necessary.</p>
<p>Let us support this call and demonstrate that we have a vision for the future just as those disc jockeys all those years ago braved the high seas so that Radio&nbsp;Caroline could bring pleasure to people. I support the motion, and could I finish by saying on a lighter note that, unlike this Assembly, Christian radio can be switched off if you do not want to listen to it.</p>

<p>When Dr&nbsp;Adamson mentioned the Appalachian mountains I could not help thinking about a television programme on Sunday night, after I was at church, which was from that area. It centred on a little church where the people were actually handling poisoned snakes. I wondered if that tradition might have come from Northern Ireland also, because we have got quite a few poisoned snakes here.</p>
<p>It was my pleasure and privilege to host a meeting for UCB in March 1999, when the managing director, Mr&nbsp;Gareth Littler, some of his colleagues and many of the MLAs came along to listen to what the people had to say. I am delighted that many MLAs were impressed with what they heard, and on subsequent days they have lent their support to UCB. I am delighted that this motion has been brought forward in the House, and I am delighted to be able to support it.</p>
<p>I am not saying that I agree with everything that is broadcast by the UCB. I come from a Calvinistical background, and there is much in contemporary Christian music that I find difficult to understand and identify with. However, I do understand that many people do find help and solace in this type of music. I realise that there are diversities within Northern Ireland and on our island, but the UCB speaks to all of those diversities. It transcends all barriers, and the message that is sent out from this radio station has helped many people and has been a blessing and uplifting to those who have listened to it.</p>
<p>Like some of my Colleagues, I find it very difficult to understand all the vileness of depravity, language and actions on radio and television. Yet here is a Christian broadcasting company seeking to deliver a message that brings release, peace and satisfaction, and it cannot get the Government to give it the necessary licence. I suppose that is indicative of a Government that seeks to control people. I realise that the problems that the UCB has had stem from the last Conservative Government, but the Labour Government have continued to deny this very worthy company a licence.</p>
<p>I ask the Government to reconsider this and give a licence to this company so that it can continue to transmit the gospel message, a message that can change lives, a message that can help, a message that can revolutionise people and a message that can make people new creatures in Christ.</p>
<p>I am delighted to be able to support the motion and trust that we will not have to wait much longer for a licence to be granted.</p>

<p>United Christian Broadcasters would never be called United Religious Broadcasters, for that would be a contradiction in terms almost. Those whom we seek to influence by this debate will be very taken by our virtual unanimity. They will be shocked, they will be rocked to their foundations, that the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; some of whom on both sides believe that those on the other side are unchristian &mdash; are advocating that religious people have access to their airwaves.</p>
<p>I do not know the <i>bona fides</i> of the UCB, and I do not need to know them. All I have to know is that there is a demand to hear the word of God. I do not know whether these people are Christian or simply religious &mdash; and I think that that is a justifiable differentiation for someone like me to make. We are bedevilled by religion, yet we have not got the numbers of Christians or the sort of Christianity that we need. The evidence of the 800&nbsp;years &mdash; or the 70&nbsp;years or the 30&nbsp;years, depending upon whose history you read &mdash; of trauma and difficulty in this society is adequate proof of that.</p>
<p>We advocate that the licence be granted to the UCB, but we point out to it that, as the people who will be judging whether it is wise to give a licence or not will realise, when you start broadcasting, you will be polluted by the religious ones.</p>
<p>They will be demanding, much as they do in politics, a better say than someone else has had. If testimonies are given, will they be those of born-again Christians or just Christians? Whether we like it or not, and whether I define right or wrong, that is a serious problem in this society. Adherence to the Word is often adherence to the interpretation of those who determine for you what the way of God is. I am minded to encourage the United Christian Broadcasters, when they get their licence, to take on the arguments that will be put to them by the religionists, because only by the outworking of the arguments going on among the religionists will we come to accept each other&rsquo;s existence. Like it or not, they are going to exist.</p>
<p>I should also like to point, with some dismay, to those issues already raised in the media, namely the debauchery and difficulties that we all, especially as parents, have to cope with. However, that is merely what we can see. We cannot see people&rsquo;s propensity to look for escapism, be it in alcohol or in drugs, and there has been a massive increase in the last five years in the degree to which our young people especially are running and hiding from the real world.</p>
<p>Nowhere, I am afraid, is the problem greater that in those areas we consider to be our Bible Belt. Belfast may indeed have large-scale problems, but many of the towns in the hinterland of rural Ulster are polluted and in severe danger. If the UCB could save just one person &mdash; and I wish it could save more &mdash; by giving young people some outlet or direction away from the debauchery in society, the granting of a licence would be very worthwhile. I wish it all the best and support the motion. I shall wait for the religious complaints.</p>

<p>I was thinking of a line from a well-known folk song during the debate today. We are talking about &quot;freedom, religion and laws&quot;, and I support the motion. The Assembly should be able to control the licensing of local stations in Northern Ireland. The present Westminster legislation &mdash; the Broadcasting Act 1990 &mdash; needs to be amended owing to the restructuring of legislation for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The BBC, admirable though its programmes may be, does not give a reasonable outlet for Christian broadcasts and gospel music throughout the week, and even the volume and the type of output on Sundays leave something to be desired.</p>
<p>Where a provider can introduce an additional radio channel which would have to compete with the current BBC service for an audience, this should be welcomed. It would be up to this new radio service to fulfil a need or go out of business. From what we have heard today, the UCB would serve a purpose, and in view of the call for it, it could not possibly go out of business. I am not in favour of monopolies, but it appears that, through this 1990 legislation, the BBC has prevented any new radio stations from providing a Christian music service. I should like to see a level playing field for all those who believe that they could contribute to filling this niche.</p>
<p>The 1990 legislation has flown in the face of freedom of expression and freedom of religion. With this new dispensation, it should now be in the hands of the Assembly to create the appropriate amendments. I hope that, once the motion is passed, something can be done to help to fill this gap in radio programming. The broadcast licensing authorities should take note of this debate and the positive support given by the Assembly &mdash; and all-party support is an indicator of the strength of feeling that the present situation cannot and should not continue.</p>
<p>I have pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>

<p>Today we have a choice to make. Is Northern&nbsp;Ireland still a Christian country or not? I believe that, for all its faults, it is. The choice we have to make is whether United Christian Broadcasters should be granted a licence to broadcast. The licence to broadcast does not mean that anybody is obliged to listen. People have the freedom to change channels. However, it should be available for those who want to hear it.</p>
<p>Many Members have talked about morality this morning. In this country morality is on the downward slope, and the media has a lot to do with it. It started on television with murders, drugs, violence, foul language and pornography. The Internet is used by people for all sorts of heinous crimes. The lyrics of some of the songs played on the radio could be described as questionable, at best.</p>
<p>Ian Adamson told us how monks from Northern Ireland went out and evangelised Europe. Perhaps in some small way we can start to do that again. I take David&nbsp;Ervine&rsquo;s point about being bedevilled by religion. However, my religion teaches me that God is a God of love. It also teaches me to love my enemies: I should forgive my brother not just seven times but 70 times seven. If we were to look at God as a God of love, it would make things much easier for us in this Assembly.</p>
<p>What we do here today will have an impact on society. It is time for society to get back to basic Christian values. Those values make us what we are, inform how we think about housing or social justice. It is about the basic Christianity that is probably in all of us. It shapes how we think about everything in which we believe. The people of this country have the right to listen to a radio station that promotes the basic Christianity that all of us feel.</p>
<p>I fully support the motion. I do not see how anybody could do other, and I thank the Chairman of the Committee for bringing it forward. I speak not as a politician but as a Christian who is concerned about the state of play in this country today. Anything that can be done to reverse the trend and turn the downward slide must be worthwhile. I commend the motion to all.</p>

<p>I wish to voice my full support for the motion this morning and for the initiative displayed in taking this case to the courts. I have expressed my concern that such violations of basic human rights by the Government are taking place in this country.</p>
<p>We are all aware of the 10-year struggle by United Christian Broadcasters to make available its music broadcast of Christian content, and how it has been thwarted at every turn. I wish to see the UCB supplying an efficient Christian music service to people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I will, like other Members in the Chamber, aid the organisation in its efforts to overturn the obvious intolerance of the United&nbsp;Kingdom&rsquo;s secular regulators.</p>
<p>I have listened to Members this morning and have been impressed. As Mr O&rsquo;Connor said, this country needs to return to Christian values. There still remains an unfulfilled passion for Christian radio and inspirational music, both in Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the rest of the United&nbsp;Kingdom. There is the demand, but the supply is prohibited here.</p>
<p>All of us are here this morning because we have been lobbied time and time again by our constituents. There is no doubt that in Northern&nbsp;Ireland there are thousands of people who support United Christian Broadcasters. I commend the work it has carried out over the years. This radio station has brought much pleasure to people of both communities in Northern&nbsp;Ireland since it started broadcasting from the Isle&nbsp;of&nbsp;Man in 1987.</p>
<p>While the Government have licensed the pop, rock, talk and classical radios, UCB, which is classed as a religious body, is prohibited from even applying for a national radio licence. Shame on the Government. Society is sick of television programmes portraying sinful acts. We need a return to Christian broadcasting on radio and television.</p>
<p>A few months ago I visited Washington DC. One thing I was impressed by was the gospel stations &mdash; the television ones included. They have an important role in the present day, when people are straying from their religious beliefs, from God and from the principles of Christianity. In America, Christian programmes are broadcast not only on radio but also on television. UCB has helped many people in this country, and further afield. I commend the work they do.</p>
<p>A newspaper recently highlighted the subject of chronic depression and the fact that more young people die through suicide than in road accidents in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. This society is corrupted with drink, drugs and other sinful acts. The Assembly could make a good start by backing this motion &mdash; as no doubt it will. We need to see Christian values brought back to this country. We are all aware of the corruption in our society. Take the issue of drugs. Young people are being destroyed by drugs. We pray that the Lord will deliver this land from all its sin and destruction.</p>
<p>I am here today to support the United Christian Broadcasters, and I hope that it will get a licence to broadcast its programmes on the radio. It is important that all Assembly Members support this important motion.</p>

<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the motion. I pay tribute to UCB for the very responsible manner in which it has lobbied Assembly Members in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Assembly Members from all constituencies in Northern&nbsp;Ireland have given their support, as the ticks on this sheet show. That augurs well for the future. We can all work together for the betterment of the Province and the people we represent.</p>
<p>It is very important that we enlist the help of everyone we can to have this ban lifted. Mr&nbsp;ONeill spoke of the support coming from Síle de Valera in the Dáil. It is also very important that we have the support of the MPs at Westminster&mdash;and, on this, we are not without friends there. On 12&nbsp;July last year&mdash;a very significant date&mdash;Edward&nbsp;Leigh, MP for Gainsborough, said</p>
<p class="small">&quot;It is easier to broadcast pornography than it is to broadcast religion in this country.&quot;</p>
<p>I am sure that we all agree. At the same time as the BBC is cutting back its religious broadcasts, the law is preventing churches from offering an alternative. Our broadcasting laws are discriminating against all religious bodies. Digital licences are available throughout the country, but religious bodies cannot apply for them. They are uniquely disadvantaged.</p>
<p>If we believe in human rights and in the European Convention for Human Rights, it is clear that the UCB has a just and righteous case. Article 9 of the convention states</p>
<p class="small">&quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.&quot;</p>
<p>Another thing that Edward&nbsp;Leigh said in the debate in the House of Commons is this:</p>
<p class="small">&quot;There is only one Christian local radio station in London, Premier Radio. Why are there 50 religious radio stations in France, but only one in the United Kingdom? The reason is that the codes are so tight that, whereas politicians or anyone else can go on television or the radio to raise funds for charity, to make exclusive claims or to recruit, religious broadcasters are not allowed to do so. If a religious broadcaster manages to get round all the difficulties of the law, the codes are so tight that it is virtually impossible to produce an interesting programme.</p>
<p class="small">What happens abroad? I have already described France. In no other country in the western world is religious broadcasting as tightly constrained as in this country. In America, there are 1,600 Christian radio stations.&quot;</p>
<p>There are Christian radio stations throughout the rest of the world (with the exception of about five various countries), yet we in the United Kingdom, who pride ourselves on Christianity, ban them.</p>
<p>I have no difficulty in supporting this motion wholeheartedly. I am gratified that it has the support of the whole Assembly.</p>

<p>It is worrying that I find myself agreeing with everything that Mr ONeill, the Member for South Down, has said. This is the first, and probably the last, time for such a thing to happen. However, I found his contribution very useful.</p>
<p>I must also congratulate the UCB on what has proved to be a very effective lobby. I am very impressed by how much people clearly know about this. There is no doubt this is the result of a very effective campaign behind the scenes to educate Members on this important issue. Perhaps there is a lesson here for the future. This is probably the first of many such lobbying campaigns.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no doubt that there is a huge demand for Christian radio in Northern Ireland. This is obvious from the size of the petition that was handed to the Chairman of the Committee and from events such as the recent conference in Coleraine. I understand that 4,000 people attended one Christian conference. The demand for other types of music is already met. Classic FM is perhaps the best-known radio station that provides a specific type of music and has a very high number of listeners. There are radio stations catering for country music, Irish music, folk music &mdash; you name it, and there is a station that caters specifically for it, except, that is, for Christian music. I think that this is long overdue.</p>
<p>This argument has been lost by default, and people are now becoming aware of the injustice which has been done to Christian broadcasters. The penny has dropped. People realise that this situation is untenable.</p>
<p class="italic">12.00</p>
<p>I suppose that Mr&nbsp;Mellor did not wish to inflict the excesses of American Christian broadcasting on the United Kingdom. However, the legislation is drawn in such a way that that cannot happen. The onus is on UCB to ensure that their quality is such that that criticism is never raised. I have been given, as I am sure many Members have, a copy of the UCB sample tape. I have played it a hundred times; it has been perpetually on my car stereo. I have found it to be very enjoyable, and I have noticed the extremely high quality of the music.</p>
<p>To be honest, I have to say that UCB&rsquo;s Cross Rhythms station is not my cup of tea. I cannot relate to that type of music at all. Maybe I am showing my age, like Mr&nbsp;Dallat. I cannot relate to this newfangled Christian rock music, reggae and all that. However, I accept that there are many thousands of young people in Northern Ireland who can. They have a right to listen to it. Neither the BBC nor any other state monopoly can dictate to the young people of Northern Ireland or to older Christian people what kind of music they may or may not listen to. It is a fundamental human right. This is such an overwhelming argument that permission must be granted.</p>
<p>Of course, one can listen to UCB on satellite, but I have tried that and it is not practical. Most people who want to listen to Christian music want to do so as they wash the dishes, drive the car or do other things. They want to listen on a portable radio. Clearly, a satellite dish is impractical. You cannot carry it around. Anyway, not everyone in Northern Ireland has access to satellite broadcasting. Hundreds of thousands of people cannot afford it. Therefore it is vital that we grant their wish.</p>
<p>I hold no brief for any particular broadcaster. The principle that applies to UCB must apply to any Christian station and any type of music. If it is of sufficient quality, there is a demand and the bandwidth is available, then it should be allowed. That is the fundamental issue. I am here not to act as a cheerleader for UCB but to enable anyone in the Province who appreciates a certain type of music or a certain type of religious conviction to have that need met, provided that standards are upheld. It gives me great pleasure to support Mr&nbsp;ONeill&rsquo;s motion. I urge the House to support it unanimously and show that this is indeed a just cause.</p>

<p>Much has been said already. This motion is about freedom of expression, which is fundamental to any democratic society. Under the Broadcasting Act 1990, UCB is disqualified from holding a terrestrial national radio licence issued by the radio authority. Current Government policy may be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. This policy should be amended and primary broadcasting legislation enacted as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>Christians are currently excluded from the United Kingdom&rsquo;s national broadcasting system. Rock, jazz, soul, classical and other musical varieties can be heard. Christians are being discriminated against. They are not permitted to own a national radio station and broadcast Christian programmes. Today, almost any minority can have access to the national media, yet Christian organisations cannot even obtain an application form.</p>
<p>By autumn 1999, more than 10,000 letters on this issue had been received in Downing&nbsp;Street and 195&nbsp;MPs had signed an early-day motion in the House of Commons. A quarter of a million people have signed a petition. United Christian Broadcasters Limited has lobbied for permission to broadcast an independent Christian music radio station since the 1980s. This matter needs to be resolved urgently.</p>
<p>UCB is a registered charity run by 50&nbsp;full-time staff and hundreds of volunteers. It runs two round-the-clock music radio stations. UCB Europe presents praise, worship and easy-listening music with bible readings and factual programmes. UCB Cross Rhythms presents contemporary gospel music for young people. These stations are non-commercial. They are entirely supported by voluntary contributions. The trustees of UCB receive no remuneration for their services.</p>
<p>For those artists working in the contemporary gospel scene, lack of access to the airwaves means that many of them are disadvantaged and relatively unknown. The opportunity to develop the Christian music industry is being missed and the demand remains unfulfilled. With many pressures in life and a high suicide rate, especially among young people, we need to support the motion which, through the gospel message, could bring hope for all society.</p>
<p>The core issue is freedom of speech and religion. This must not be lost because of Sinn&nbsp;Féin&rsquo;s political point-scoring. It is rather hypocritical of Sinn&nbsp;Féin Members to say that they support freedom of religion and expression when the IRA murdered Catholics and Protestants who were travelling to and from their places of worship. I support the motion.</p>

<p>I too welcome the debate and the opportunity to express my support for United Christian Broadcasters and its right to broadcast in the United Kingdom. The Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee said that a petition with 27,000 names has been presented to him. More than 250,000 people have signed a petition which has been passed to Westminster. There is widespread support for UCB throughout the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland. There is clearly no logic in the position currently being taken by the United Kingdom Government.</p>
<p>Let us consider the international scene. In New&nbsp;Zealand, three national radio networks broadcast Christian music; in Australia there are approximately 100 such radio stations; and, we have been advised, in Russia, four AM frequencies are available. Throughout the United&nbsp;States, such stations are widespread. The countries that have banned United Christian Broadcasters are Afganistan, China, Iran, Iraq and, of course, the United Kingdom. The UK is out of step with normal western European Christian values. There should be freedom of religious expression in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I have listened to United Christian Broadcasters programmes and found them very positive and uplifting. UCB offers an uplifting and important message in an increasingly discontented and materialistic world. I received from the Minister of Tourism, Film and Broadcasting at Westminster a letter which highlights what is currently banned in the United Kingdom. She said</p>
<p class="small">&quot;The Broadcasting Act 1990 disqualified groups whose objectives were wholly or mainly of a religious nature from holding a terrestrial national radio licence issued by a radio authority &hellip; Religious organisations could hold a satellite, a digital satellite or a radio licence, but not a terrestrial digital radio multiplex or sound programme service licence under the Broadcasting Act 1996&quot;.</p>
<p>If information is of suitable content to be broadcast over satellite, why on earth is it not suitable for broadcasting on conventional radio? I do not understand that at all.</p>
<p>As a parent of young children I try to protect them from unsettling influences. When we think about what we have seen on TV or listened to on the radio in the last few weeks or months there appears to be very little censorship in the United Kingdom. Why should the programmes produced by UCB be censored? UCB broadcasts a message of Christian hope, joy and solace, which answers the basic needs of the human spirit.</p>
<p>I support the motion and hope that it will be supported unanimously in the Chamber, thereby reflecting the widespread cross-community support that has been expressed.</p>

<p>I will begin by thanking all the Members for their wide-ranging and generous support. The Committee members in particular will be very pleased that the motion has found what appears to be general favour. I, like others, hope that it will receive unanimous approval today.</p>
<p>I will refer briefly to some of the points raised, starting with the scholarly contribution from Dr Adamson, in which he sketched the historical background and the contributions that people from this island, and this part of the island, made to the many different aspects of music and Christianity. It was most interesting and very pertinent. Then we had a contribution from Roger Hutchinson about snakes. That reminded me of Brendan Behan&rsquo;s comment that when St Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland they all went to New York and became politicians. I am not sure if either of those eminent Members was referring to that kind of thing. However, it was a good and balanced debate. There was always the danger of sermonising, and some Members succumbed a little to that, and did very well at it. Obviously they have had plenty of practice in other forums. However, it was all healthy, good and part of the mix that makes us what we are.</p>
<p>David Ervine expressed concern which I am sure it is shared by many Members. I have no particular brief to speak on behalf of United Christian Broadcasters, but the thing that impressed me about UCB was its comprehensive Christian approach, involving an amalgamation of all the major Christian churches. That is not only good practice for Christian broadcasting but also an example to all of us. In addition, some Members revealed some of their innermost thoughts and feelings. Assemblyman Dallat referred to his progressive age problem, and Assemblyman Wells admitted quite publicly that he is not very groovy. These useful contributions serve to illustrate the complex mix that goes to make up the membership of the Assembly.</p>
<p>Many Members referred to the international scene. Roy Beggs&rsquo;s contribution was very pertinent. It illustrated the performance of some countries which do not allow Christian broadcasting to take place. One sees the sort of league that we are in, and it is not particularly inspiring. I thank the Member for his contribution.</p>
<p>There are many things that I could say, but Members were generally in support throughout the debate. I thank them sincerely for their support, and I hope that there will be a unanimous decision by the House.</p>
<p class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p class="italic">Resolved:</p>
<p class="small">That this Assembly calls upon the appropriate broadcast licensing authorities to facilitate United Christian Broadcasters in their use of unused AM frequencies.</p>
<p class="italic">Adjourned at 12.15 pm.</p>
