<p>On a point of order, Mr Speaker. You will be aware that shortly after the events in the House yesterday, an announcement was made to the effect that 500 workers are to lose their jobs in the Water Service. Is it in order to ask that the new Minister for Regional Development address the House at an early opportunity to reassure Water Service workers that there will be no compulsory redundancies?</p>

<p><em>Motion made:</em></p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Standing Order 48(4) requires that the principle of proportionality that applies to Statutory Committees should also apply to Standing Committees. It is my belief, and that of the United Community group, that the failure to include any Member from my group on the Assembly and Executive Review Committee means that the requirement set out in Standing Order 48(4) has not been met.</p>
<p>It also seems illogical that a Committee that is to review the total operation of the Assembly does not contain a single Member from a party outside the Executive. It appears that those who talked so much about inclusivity in the past are less anxious about inclusivity now. I understand that discussions are ongoing about the issue that I have raised; however, for the reason that I have outlined, the United Community group will not be supporting the motion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in respect of Standing Order 51, it appears the ultimate contradiction that a party&rsquo;s nominating officer &mdash; even if he is only that party&rsquo;s acting nominating officer &mdash; can nominate himself to be Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee. That Committee must be seen to be independent. Such a proposal would not be allowed in Westminster, the Oireachtas, Holyrood or Cardiff Bay. It is most damaging for the Assembly&rsquo;s prospects that that nomination is going through. My group, through its representation on the Business Committee, recognises fully what is happening, but let no one say that our failure to divide the House implies that we accept the terms of the motion.</p>
