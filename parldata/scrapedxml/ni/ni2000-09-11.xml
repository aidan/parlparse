<p>I wish to inform the House that Mr&nbsp;Gregory Campbell has been appointed Minister for Regional Development on the resignation of Mr Peter Robinson MP, and that Mr Maurice Morrow has been appointed Minister for Social Development on the resignation of Mr Nigel Dodds.

<p>As the House is aware, the headquarters of the Royal Irish Regiment is in the North Antrim constituency. I am sure that the residents not only there but in the whole of Northern Ireland will want to express their gratitude to Almighty God for an answer to their prayers and the deliverance of those who were held captive as hostages.</p>
<p>We also wish to pay tribute to the member of the British Army who lost his life while helping to save the lives of these young men. To their families and friends we wish to express our great relief that they are now free. Getting the hostages out without further bloodshed is something of which the British Army can be proud.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" speakeroffice="The First Minister" time="10.30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>With permission, Mr Speaker, the Deputy First Minister and I will make a statement about the legislative priorities of the Executive Committee for the Assembly session from September 2000 until July 2001. In making this statement we will have to be sketchy about the content of some of the measures, but we feel that it is desirable to give Members as much notice as possible about the subjects that are likely to come forward over the course of this session.</p>
<p>I should like to begin by updating the legislative proposals announced in the Assembly on 31&nbsp;January. At that time we set out a programme of some 12 Bills to be introduced in the initial session, with a further six being brought forward later. Of the initial 12 items of primary legislation announced, three have been made. These Equality (Disability etc.) Order and an Appropriation Order, both of which were made by Order in Council at Westminster during the suspension of the Assembly, having been initiated here. The third was an Appropriation Bill which, as Members will know, was made by Assembly Bill before the summer recess and received Royal Assent on 25 July. A further four Bills were introduced to the Assembly in June, namely the Ground Rents Bill, a Weights and Measures Bill, a Dogs (Amendment) Bill and a Fisheries Bill. These are now at various stages of the Assembly process, and approval was given by the Assembly on 3 July to carry them forward into the new session.</p>
<p>Of the five remaining Bills announced in the initial programme, two represent parity measures, and their timing was dependent on the progress of corresponding Bills before Parliament at Westminster. These are a Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill and a Health and Personal Social Services Bill. The Great Britain legislation was completed on 28 July, after the Assembly recess, and both Northern Ireland Bills are now being finalised for introduction at the end of this month. A further two Bills &mdash; the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Bill and the Street Trading Bill &mdash; are at an advanced stage of drafting for introduction by October. The final Bill in this group &mdash; a Trustees Bill&nbsp;&mdash; was deferred pending further legislation at Westminster. It is now hoped that this will be introduced before Christmas.</p>
<p>I shall now move on to the Executive Committee&rsquo;s further legislative proposals for the current session.</p>
<p>In addition to the Bills I have already mentioned, the Executive has identified a further 21 proposals for legislation at this time.</p>
<p>I shall start with Appropriation Bills. Depending on the position with autumn supplementary requirements, an Appropriation Bill may be required in late October. Thereafter, two Appropriation Bills will be needed, one to deal with the spring Supplementary Estimates in February, while the second, setting the Main Estimates, will be introduced in May.</p>
<p>In addition, it is intended to bring forward four other Bills relating to Finance and Personnel matters in this session.</p>
<p>The first is a Resource Accounting and Budgeting Bill to implement resource accounting and budgeting in Northern Ireland from the new financial year.</p>
<p>The second is a Defective Premises (Landlords) Bill. This would implement reforms recommended by the Law Reform Advisory Committee in relation to a landlord&rsquo;s liability to repair defective premises that he owns. Under the current law, landlords have certain immunities from this liability.</p>
<p>The third Bill is a Family Law Bill, which would facilitate the acquisition of parental responsibility for unmarried fathers and modernise the law on scientific tests to determine parentage.</p>
<p>Finally, the Audit (Transfer of Staff) Bill is to enable the transfer of staff from the Health Service and local government audit to the employment of the Northern Ireland Audit Office. The purpose of this would be to enhance the independence of the audit function.</p>
<p>On agriculture matters a Foyle Fisheries Act 1952 (Amendment) Bill will be brought forward. The main purpose of this Bill will be to amend the Foyle Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1952 to enhance the functions of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission in line with the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Order (Northern Ireland) 1999. These new functions would relate to the promotion and development of Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough, and the development and licensing of aquaculture in the loughs. The Bill must proceed in parallel with corresponding legislation in the South. It was originally intended as a composite measure along with that dealing with the regulation of shellfish. However, owing to time constraints, it was decided to separate the two elements and take the latter forward in the Bill currently before the Assembly.</p>
<p>The Deputy First Minister will deal with the other Bills.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" speakeroffice="The Deputy First Minister" time="10.30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>A number of Bills are proposed in relation to Department of the Environment matters.</p>
<p>A Local Government (Best Values) Bill will remove existing statutory provision for the compulsory competitive tendering of specified council services and replace it with a new duty on councils to achieve best value in the delivery of all of their services.</p>
<p>A Local Government (Finance) Bill will introduce a new methodology for the distribution of the resources element of General Exchequer grant to district councils. The new methodology will address the complex nature of the current formula and also provide for regular payments to facilitate good financial planning by district councils. It will also incorporate factors into the calculation that will take account of relative socio-economic disadvantage between districts in accordance with New TSN principles.</p>
<p>A Game (Amendment) Bill will be brought forward to amend the partridge-shooting season. There will also be a Dangerous Wild Animals Bill to regulate dangerous wild animals kept in private collections in Northern Ireland to ensure the safety of the public through a licensing scheme and the facilitating of processes of appraisal, appeal, inspection and seizure.</p>
<p>There is a need for planning legislation, which will include proposals to clarify and strengthen development control and enforcement powers; give primacy to development plans in the determination of planning applications; and amend the working practices of the Planning Appeals Commission.</p>
<p>A number of Bills are also planned to do with Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety matters.</p>
<p>First, a Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults Bill will place the current Pre-Employment Consultancy Service (PECS) on a statutory basis and widen its remit to include vulnerable adults in certain settings. Placing the existing scheme on a statutory basis will allow it to become part of a UK-wide scheme to provide safeguards for children and ensure that details of those deemed unsuitable to work with children can be exchanged between jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A Carers and Disabled Children Bill will provide legislation to facilitate trusts in the provision of carer assessments, including extending to the carer choice in the sourcing of care provision following assessment.</p>
<p>A Children Leaving Care Bill will help to improve the life chances of young people aged 16 and over who have been looked after by health and social services trusts as they move from care to independent living. It will change the financial regime for supporting these young people and involve changes to the social security benefits system.</p>
<p>Also, a further Health and Personal Social Services Bill is planned to put in place a framework for the setting of explicit standards and guidelines for health and personal social services.</p>
<p>From the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister an Electronic Communications Bill will be brought forward to enable Northern Ireland Departments to amend legislation to facilitate the use of electronic signatures and electronic data as described in the UK-wide Electronic Communications Act 2000.</p>
<p>The Minister for Social Development has plans to bring forward a Housing Bill, which will include new arrangements for housing regulation.</p>
<p>The Minister for Regional Development is considering three pieces of legislation dealing with transport matters, including possible travel concessions, the development of public/private partnership to improve bus and rail services, road user charging, workplace car park levies and a new legislative framework to support modern and safe rail travel.</p>
<p>Before any legislation is brought to the Assembly, Executive Committee approval of the policy and draft Bill is required. The policy issues associated with the legislative proposals from the Ministers for Regional and Social Development will have to be carefully considered by the Executive Committee. Unfortunately, if those Ministers continue to absent themselves from the Executive Committee meetings, the full exploration of the policy issues becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>Our priority, however, is to provide good government for all people in Northern Ireland, and these Bills will be incorporated into the legislative programme if the Executive Committee is content with the detail of what is proposed.</p>
<p>Finally, this programme represents the legislative needs identified by the Executive Committee at this stage; it is not an exhaustive list. During the year, Ministers may, and probably will, wish to bring forward other policy initiatives, particularly those associated with the Programme for Government that require legislative authority. In the coming months, consultation documents will be issued and views taken on a number of further initiatives. The legislative programme, as set out, constitutes the current priorities, but it is possible that one or more pieces of legislation may not come forward. It is also possible that additional legislative proposals could be brought forward to the Assembly in the current session. For example, in this latter category the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has reported the possible need for legislation arising from the current review of industrial development agencies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90066" speakername="Mr James Leslie" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I welcome the statement from the First and Deputy First Ministers on their legislative programme, which contains a number of measures that I think will be of benefit. However, I am concerned that the Game (Amendment) Bill will be brought forward to amend the partridge-shooting season. This matter was brought to the attention of the Environment Committee in July. A consultation paper has been issued, and I believe that responses are due by 20 September. I have responded to the consultation paper to the effect that I am not persuaded of the need for this change. Therefore I am very concerned, as the consulation period has not yet ended, that this statement says that a Bill will be brought forward. I trust that whether a Bill is brought forward, and what it might contain, will be decided upon in the light of the outcome of the consultation process.</p>
<p>On transport matters, I welcome the idea that a Bill may be brought forward to develop public and private partnerships to improve bus and rail services. Can the First and Deputy First Ministers reassure the House that no decisions will be made on the closure of railway lines until every avenue has been explored for financing and improving the services? It is essential that the opportunity to mobilise private finance be made available before any such decision is taken.</p>

<p>Members have returned from the recess, and I urge them to return to the good habit of ensuring that questions are actually questions rather than statements &mdash; although, inevitably, some expressions of view will form part of them.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>Mr Speaker, you have referred to the ingenuity of the hon Member in drawing attention to the possibility of financing railways through public private partnerships, and no doubt that will be considered. I am not in a position to comment on the Member&rsquo;s question with regard to a Railways Bill. All we are saying at this stage is that we have received a request from the appropriate Department to include provision for legislation on those transport matters. We are not in a position to comment on what policy matters might be contained within that or the particular policy choices to which the Member refers. Obviously, these will have to be discussed, and my Colleague the Deputy First Minister has drawn attention to the difficulties we have in discussing them given the non-participation of the relevant Minister.</p>
<p>With regard to the Game (Amendment) Bill, I would like to reassure the Member about the language that was used. From a timetable point of view &mdash;and it is necessary to attempt some timetabling of the legislation &mdash; we have looked at where legislation on game matters might come in.</p>
<p>Where it might come in terms of timetable is not intended in any way to preclude the consideration that will occur in Committee. It is perfectly open for the Committee, and the Department in consultation with the Committee, to look at the proposals and to change them or, indeed, to decide to withdraw the legislation. We did give a general warning at the end of the statement that this timetable was not set in stone, and the particular matters to which the hon Member has referred are part of the reason for that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90067" speakername="Ms Patricia Lewsley" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I welcome the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults Bill. I do not have to remind the Assembly of the unfortunate history we have in Northern Ireland of the abuse of children and vulnerable adults. Will the Deputy First Minister explain some of the steps in this Bill, and will he also give some consideration to the scheme so that we can work with the Republic of Ireland to ensure that abuse of children and vulnerable adults does not happen there?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>The aim of the Bill, in broad terms, is to provide safeguards for children and vulnerable adults by putting systems in place for checking the suitability of persons seeking to work with them. They will be operated by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on the basis of the information provided by those seeking to work with children and adults with a learning disability.</p>
<p>Checks will be carried out, including checks against criminal records, records held on those banned from working in schools and the PECS register. The register is compiled from information provided by statutory and voluntary organisations in relation to workers who have been dismissed or transferred in circumstances in which it is considered that they do pose a threat to children or vulnerable adults with a learning disability. The decision to place the name on the register is made by the Department in consultation with the Social Services Inspectorate.</p>
<p>The system is in advance of that in any other part of the United Kingdom but has no statutory basis. Placing the existing system on a statutory basis would allow it to become part of a wide scheme to improve safeguards for children and ensure that details of those deemed unsuitable to work with children could be exchanged between jurisdictions. That would apply also to the Republic of Ireland. On an island such as this it is absolutely essential that that information be available to both Governments.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90098" speakername="Rev Dr Ian Paisley" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>In a previous statement the First and Deputy First Ministers told us that the Executive agree that we need to do more for the long-suffering agriculture industry. What is in this programme to benefit agriculture? We have one Bill that is tied in with the South of Ireland. Do the Ministers realise the perilous state of the agriculture industry at the present time? I call their attention to an extract from the statement. It says</p>
<p class="small">&quot;There is need for planning legislation which would include proposals to clarify and strengthen development control and enforcement powers&quot;.</p>
<p>Are they going to take a realistic view and relax planning control on farm land so that farmers can gain something from their property? I draw their attention to the Agriculture Committee&rsquo;s recommendation. Is the Department of the Environment going to take steps to do something with regard to that?</p>
<p>With regard to Ministers not attending the Executive, the Ministers of the DUP are doing exactly what the First Minister said he would do. He said that if there was no decommissioning he would not be sitting down with IRA/Sinn Féin. They are keeping their word to the electorate, and in a few days&rsquo; time the electorate of South Antrim will have an opportunity to decide on this issue.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>The first two points made by the Member related to agricultural matters, although one was disguised &mdash; it is a planning matter. The Member is aware that the bulk of policy and other matters relating to agriculture are determined by Europe. This is a European matter. The scope for local initiatives is limited. Nonetheless, as the Member knows, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is engaged in developing a vision for the future of agriculture in Northern Ireland. It is aware of the challenges and is trying, within the limited scope there is for local discretion, to develop a view for the future of agriculture. We are aware of the extent of the crisis facing agriculture at the moment, and need to work out a clear future for it &mdash; something which goes beyond a &quot;quick fix&quot; or simply injects a little bit money on a one-off basis into some farms, but not into others. We need to establish a vision for the future.</p>
<p>All the changes that are taking place, both inside and outside the European Community, affect this industry. The planning matters referred to are obviously important in themselves. The Member will agree that there is a clear need to review the planning service so that it becomes more effective and takes decisions more speedily. These measures may achieve that aim. The relevant Minister will go into greater detail on this.</p>
<p>Finally, I noticed that the hon Member said that his party was sticking to its pledges by refusing to sit down with Sinn Féin. I also noticed comments in the media today about publicity in Committees. I hope that it will be possible, through the greater publicity that is to be given to Committee meetings, for the people of Northern Ireland to see that the Member in question is sitting down with Sinn Féin each day but coming to this Chamber and pretending otherwise.</p>

<p>I said that we were not sitting on the Executive. He can take that grin off his face because he knows that he is going to get his come-uppances very shortly.</p>

<p>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle. When working with our DUP colleagues on the Standing Orders and the Statutory Committees, we find that they do not behave in this way. Normally it is fairly businesslike.</p>
<p>I thank the First and the Deputy First Ministers for their statement. I am drawn to the section which deals with the semi-detached Ministers for Regional and Social Development. I hope that in their consideration of how this affects the legislative process there will be an examination of how they fulfil the Pledge of Office. Even in the context of the current crisis in the Department for Regional Development, the Minister concerned is not prepared to meet with members of my party.</p>

<p>Order. I have been reasonably generous in trying to identify at which point a Member&rsquo;s oration relates to the statement by the First and the Deputy First Ministers. As yet I have not quite identified that point in this oration. I ask the Member to address himself to that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.17" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90083" speakername="Mr Mitchel McLaughlin" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I am dealing with the final page of the statement, which refers to those Ministers who continue to absent themselves. I hope that we will get specific proposals from the First and the Deputy First Ministers about how this will be dealt with.</p>
<p>My primary point &mdash; and I would like an answer to this from the First Minister &mdash; is that the statement continually refers to the parallel legislation being developed at Westminster which has consequences here.</p>
<p>In the final section of his statement the First&nbsp;Minister indicated that this is not an exhaustive list and that Ministers may wish to bring forward other policy initiatives. Can he provide an assurance at this stage that the local government elections, which are scheduled for May of next year, will proceed at that time, and that we will not have a late ministerial initiative on that issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.18" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" time="11:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I thank the hon Member for a question which is not entirely related to the legislative programme. As I understand it, the hon&nbsp;Member is seeking an opinion on something which does not appear on the legislative programme, and the reason it does not appear on the legislative programme is that it is not within the competency of this Administration to put it there. Although I would love to be in a position to answer the question, I would be foolhardy even to attempt to make a guess at what might be included in any arrangements for a hypothetical case such as this, if it ever ceased to be hypothetical.</p>
<p>In terms of the hon&nbsp;Member&rsquo;s previous point it is quite true. I make this appeal and put it on record again: having an Administration of our own in Northern Ireland is something worth nurturing. To have it on the basis of a four-part coalition is very difficult indeed. It is made more difficult when we do not have the opportunity to develop the corporate responsibility that we owe to the people of Northern Ireland and that collectivism which will eventually make it a very fine Administration. The sooner we are all in a position to concentrate our efforts in a collective way, the better this Administration will be.</p>

<p>My first comment is to express a degree of disappointment that the majority of the Bills being brought before us today appear to be rather slavishly following legislation from another place. I hope that we will soon reach the day when our own stamp of individuality can be placed on the legislative programme. The people will cherish the Northern Ireland Assembly when they see that it is doing things to their advantage. That has been lacking so far. I seek an assurance from the First&nbsp;Minister and the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister, particularly in relation to the Appropriation Bills and the Estimates for the financial cycle, that we will have a proper amount of time and information to enable, for example, the Finance and Personnel Committee to fulfil its scrutiny role. The honeymoon period &mdash; if I may put it that way &mdash; should be seen to be over.</p>
<p>On the question of local government Bills &mdash; and again this mirrors to a degree Mr&nbsp;Mallon&rsquo;s comments &mdash; it strikes me that we are continuing to tinker with local government. The First&nbsp;Minister and the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister agree that a more radical overhaul of local government is required. I do not believe that with a Northern Ireland Assembly with legislative powers we can continue to justify 26&nbsp;local authorities and, in particular, the Local Government Finance Bill, which is looking at the resource element of the General Exchequer grant. Do the First&nbsp;Minister and the Deputy First&nbsp;Ministers agree that this is effectively trying to make councils which are non-viable, viable at the expense of the rates? That is not the proper way to go about it. Do they also agree that the question of the new duty on councils to achieve best value &mdash; the move from compulsory competitive tendering to best value &mdash; is nothing but another layer of bureaucracy for hard-pressed council officials to cope with? It has been demonstrated clearly over the years that local government does operate efficiently in Northern Ireland. Up until now, the question mark would have to be placed on the Department. One has only to look at the measure of efficiency being demonstrated by the rate of increases in district rates and compare that with the rate of increase in regional rates to see where efficiency and best value are coming from.</p>
<p>I welcome the comments of the First and Deputy First Ministers on that aspect.</p>
<p>To be slightly frivolous, I note that the Game (Amendment) Bill is to extend the shooting season. I find it rather ironic that we are attempting to extend shooting seasons when we are all trying to bring about the completion of decommissioning in order to eliminate any shooting here. Am I not also correct that the grey partridge in Northern Ireland is extinct? Is the extra month of shooting to give the shooters a possibility of finding this poor extinct bird rather than for any other reason, such as an increase in finance?</p>
<p>The proposed amendments in planning &mdash;</p>

<p>Order. There is a limit of one hour for questions. We not only have to share power; we also have to share time to ensure that Members get an opportunity to put questions and that Ministers get an opportunity to respond. I call now on the First Minister to respond.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.21" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="11:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>First, I will deal with the Member&rsquo;s fifth and sixth questions. He referred to them as &quot;frivolous&quot;. I do not agree that trying to persuade people to use firearms only for entirely legal purposes is frivolous. That purpose is a very serious one. One must not confuse the legal use of firearms, as in this context, with the illegal use of firearms that we want to see ended completely.</p>
<p>With regard to the Member&rsquo;s question about the grey partridge, I have to confess that I have no knowledge of that at all. It is a closed book to me, and I shall refer that to the Minister responsible. I cannot answer the question.</p>
<p>On the first point that the Member made about his being disappointed about the measures that are being brought forward, he himself does appreciate that until we reach the point of evolving a programme for government and the Administration starts to sort out its collective priorities and policies, there will not be any exciting new measures. At first sight these might appear to be mundane matters. Policies cannot really be made independently on a departmental basis. There are many ramifications, and many policies involve a range of Departments. I said that at first sight the business may not look very exciting. However, there are important things here. What we are doing in some of these matters is repairing the neglect that stemmed from direct rule.</p>
<p>To illustrate that neglect, I will take the measure that the Member referred to: the Dangerous Wild Animals Bill. It may not be a huge problem, but it is a serious problem that has been raised in this Chamber before. The legislation coming forward mirrors GB legislation, enacted in 1976. Because of the neglect that we encountered under direct rule, that legislation, which deals with an important matter, does not apply here.</p>
<p>One could have gone exhaustively through the statute book and found scores of matters that have been enacted in England and Wales or for Great Britain generally which have not been paralleled here. As a result of that, our statute book is in a bit of a mess. And much of that is a result of accumulated neglect over quite a time. It is not all due to direct rule, but most of it is. One of the things that devolution enables us to do is start to tackle that problem. It may not be terribly spectacular, but it is important.</p>
<p>I agree in general terms with the comments about appropriation, the Finance and Personnel Committee and procedures. However, they are subject to the unique problems of a particular timetable that has to be met, and we are still running to try to catch up. We have a very tight timetable to meet for the initial stages of the Programme for Government, and that has to tie in with the budgetary exercise, which also has timetables to meet. I know that the honeymoon period cannot run indefinitely, and we do appreciate the tolerance, good sense and co-operation that the Finance and Personnel Committee has shown in dealing with the problems that arise.</p>
<p>The hon Member then referred to local government generally. He raised a number of points about the viability of councils. There are major issues which we hope to tackle, to a certain extent, through a review of public administration. We hope to bring forward some proposals about the structure and range of that review soon. The hon&nbsp;Member&rsquo;s comments were based on an assumption of what the outcome of that review might be. It is not appropriate for me to follow on from that. He was doubting the viability of some councils and was critical of how we operate. He was also critical of any changes in local government functions. Those are valid points, but not ones that I can address in these circumstances.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland a consultation exercise on best value was initiated in December 1997. I am told that it revealed cross-council support for the introduction of best value in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Consequently a decision was taken to implement the new policy on a voluntary basis, working in partnership with district councils in advance of primary legislation. New primary legislation is now needed to make provision for the repeal of compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) as further deferral is not a viable option. The measure is intended to help councils, not to add an extra layer of bureaucracy.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.22" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90090" speakername="Ms Jane Morrice" time="11:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>We welcome the recognition of the need for amendment to the planning legislation, including proposals to clarify and strengthen development control and enforcement powers. This would give primacy to development plans in the determination of planning applications. I also understand what Dr Paisley said about the need to relax planning controls on farmland. Will this amendment strengthen planning controls in urban areas? I am sure that the First and Deputy First Ministers recognise that there is serious concern in certain areas about unfettered development. Does this planning legislation intend to strengthen control in urban areas and put a stop to unfettered development?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.23" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" time="11:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I agree with Ms Morrice, but I cannot, by definition, put it in context. I also agree with Dr&nbsp;Paisley&rsquo;s point on rural planning and how it applies, especially, to the farming community. I agree that planning can be part of the environmental blight in urban areas, just as much as a lack of planning is in other areas. At this stage it is not possible to say exactly what the Bill is going to do and what it is going to deal with.</p>
<p>Two key elements have been touched upon. One is to try to facilitate those who live off the land, to enable them to live on the land. That is very important. As someone who has represented rural areas for a long time, I have seen young people raised on a farm, working on it and then having to move to a Housing Executive house in a town five or 10 miles away. That is not good from a social point of view or from a planning point of view.</p>
<p>With regard to urban planning, spacial deprivation in parts of Belfast, and in almost all the bigger towns in the North of Ireland, must be looked at. That is a matter not just for the planners but also for us, as public representatives, and for other Departments. One can look at the linkage between violence, especially recently, and that type of spacial deprivation and see that certain questions have to be answered.</p>
<p>To refer to a point made by Assemblyman Close, there should be a review of planning in Northern Ireland, and planning priorities should be established. What was good enough for Milton Keynes for 30-odd years is not good enough for a Northern Ireland that has its own Administration, talents, creativity and a unique knowledge of its place and the people who live in it. If we proceeded to bring a new creativity into that, we could produce something that would be recognisable as being more in tune with life of North of Ireland than some of the regulations that we administer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.24" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90011" speakername="Mr Roy Beggs" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>As the Assembly Member who highlighted the lack of legislation governing dangerous wild animals in Northern Ireland I welcome the Bill to deal with this matter.</p>
<p>Under the paragraph dealing with a Local Government (Finance) Bill the statement mentions New TSN principles. I was dissatisfied with the proposed New TSN criteria governing economic development and higher and further education, training and employment. I am on the Committee for Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment, and the Committee and I made representations on that to the New TSN unit. Can the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister tell us when the new criteria for New TSN will be made public and when the consultation period will be over so that we can be satisfied that our concerns have been addressed?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.25" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>There is a reference in the Local Government (Finance) legislation to New TSN. New TSN is called &quot;new&quot; because it is intended to be better than the &quot;old&quot;. One of the ways to make it better is to refine the criteria more precisely for identifying the areas concerned and for dealing in the best way with the spatial deprivation that has been mentioned. It is also important to ensure that the criteria are always objective and relevant, and we hope they will be.</p>
<p>These matters relate to the particular responsibilities of the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and we intend to proceed with them, in the public arena, as quickly as possible.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.26" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90056" speakername="Dr Joe Hendron" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I welcome the statement from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. I particularly welcome the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Bill. The present legislation is in a mess, and any proposal that may help families to adopt a child whether from Romania or elsewhere is to be welcomed. However, in saying that, I am concerned about child trafficking, and I seek an assurance that the Bill will address that point.</p>
<p>With regard to the Health and Personal Social Services Bill, I would like to see social workers being able to secure qualifications which are necessary for standards.</p>
<p>I welcome the proposed repeal of the law on GP fundholding, but I, like many other people throughout Northern Ireland, am concerned about what will take its place in primary health care. I would like an assurance from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister that there will be full and proper consultation on the future of primary care in Northern Ireland &mdash; on every aspect of primary care, from mental health, to the elderly, to children&rsquo;s services.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>There are three parts to the Assemblyman&rsquo;s questions. I am aware of the interest that Dr&nbsp;Hendron has in the matter of adoption, and I know how sensitive and difficult an area it is, but I know of nobody who is better equipped to give us information on this matter than he himself.</p>
<p>This Bill will make provision to give effect in Northern Ireland to the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, concluded at the Hague on 29&nbsp;May 1993, and make further provision in relation to adoptions with an international element.</p>
<p>It will make it an offence for anyone other than an adoption agency to assess the suitability of prospective adopters of children from overseas. Secondly, it will be an offence to bring a child into Northern Ireland for the purposes of adoption without satisfying certain conditions that will be prescribed in regulations.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to pay tribute to those people who work in this ultra-sensitive area, and those who have had the courage to adopt &mdash; many of them late in life. Many people&rsquo;s lives in this country and beyond have been changed by their great generosity.</p>
<p>In relation to the point about changes in primary care, and in the Health Service as a whole, reference was made to our lack of legislation that goes to the heart of many of the problems here. That is what we want to rectify in terms of health care. However, it can only be done after a remarkable amount of consultation. That consultation must take place. Much of it is statutory, and will take place with the relevant professionals. Much of it has to be done in the Assembly Committees as well. However, I agree that the sooner the Assembly gets its own substantive primary legislation on the table for health care, education, agriculture and planning, the sooner we will know that we are creating a new way of life for everyone here. That stems from a vibrant political process.</p>
<p>The sooner we get that primary legislation, the better for all of us &mdash; the better for the end results and the better for the political process.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.28" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90036" speakername="Mr Nigel Dodds" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I welcome the proposal for the Social Development Department to bring forward a Housing Bill. This will be extremely important for the people of Northern Ireland, and I look forward to that legislation. I note that the First Minister has begun, as he has continued over the summer, by attacking DUP Ministers while praising Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA Ministers for their work. Will the First Minister take it from me that the DUP will continue to act in accordance with its electoral mandate and its electoral pledges? We, unlike &mdash; I was going to say &quot;the party&quot; &mdash; the half a party that he now leads, will not be breaking our election pledges.</p>
<p>He may do that, but does he not realise that his support for a policy of IRA/Sinn Féin&rsquo;s inclusion in the Government is the primary reason for him now being in a minority position in Unionism &mdash; overwhelmingly in this Assembly, as illustrated by the last vote here? I would like to hear his comments on that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.29" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90242" speakername="Mr Speaker" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>Order. I must encourage Members and Ministers not only to be as concise and relevant as possible but also to stick to questions on the statement itself. There is a danger of its being widened.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.30" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90036" speakername="Mr Nigel Dodds" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I simply commented on the fact that the First Minister had once again attacked DUP Ministers, while continuing to praise the performance of IRA/Sinn Féin Ministers. Does the First Minister accept that the reason he is in a minority is that he continues to break his pledges and that the Unionist people of Northern Ireland do not accept that IRA/Sinn Féin should be in the Government? That is why this statement today &mdash;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.31" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90242" speakername="Mr Speaker" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>Order. The Member is very aware of what is in the statement and what is not in the statement. Making comments on other matters is not addressing the statement on the legislative programme. The Member may take the view that what he is addressing should be in the statement, but it is not in the statement. If it is not in the statement, it is not a subject for a question.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.32" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90036" speakername="Mr Nigel Dodds" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>The First&nbsp;Minister, along with the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister, without whom he does not make any statement or take any action in his capacity as First&nbsp;Minister, has decided to criticise the performance of DUP Ministers. Does he not realise that the reason he is in a minority on the Unionist benches is that he continues to break his pledges on the issue of decommissioning? If he wants to criticise DUP Ministers, as he has done in this statement today, why does he not have the courage to put a motion before the Assembly to vote them out of office? Let him stop huffing and puffing. Let him put up or shut up.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.33" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>The Member&rsquo;s only reference to my statement was a passing one at the outset to the housing proposal that has come forward from the Department for Social Development. As we said in the statement, until the Executive has had the opportunity of familiarising itself with the policy issues, it will be difficult for us to include the proposal in the programme. We had that difficulty because, while the Minister concerned, or the former Minister, is prepared to come along to this Chamber and make a lot of noise, generating a lot more heat than light, he is not prepared to shed any light on his proposals in the Executive, where it counts.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.34" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90070" speakername="Mr Alex Maskey" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom cupla ceist a chur.</p>
<p>I have two questions to put to the First and Deputy First&nbsp;Ministers. The first one relates to the issue which has just been debated. I find the statement ambiguous with regard to the policies and draft Bills coming from the DUP Ministers. What arrangements, if any, are in place for the scrutiny of such Bills in the Executive before they come before the Assembly?</p>
<p>I would like to put the second question to the First&nbsp;Minister in particular. The Deputy First&nbsp;Minister responded to Mitchel&nbsp;McLaughlin&rsquo;s point about possible legislation to defer local government elections. I know that that is not within the remit of the Executive, but nevertheless the First&nbsp;Minister touched on the matter. He mentioned the desirability of holding discussions about a review of the administration of the Six&nbsp;Counties. Are such discussions taking place, and, if so, who is involved in them? The suggestion of a review of administration, including local government and whether local government elections now need to be postponed, affects all of us.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.35" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I thank the Assemblyman for his questions. He made reference to the previous question. I am not sure in which context. I repeat that until we have collectivity within the Executive we shall not be as able as possible to get the cohesion which is needed for major legislation.</p>
<p>Any piece of primary legislation has various stages. It has to be taken through the House and the Committee. It is a fairly arduous task. That point has to be reached, and I want to see this Administration at its strongest when it reaches that point. The policy memorandum that comes to the Executive with any proposed legislation is, by nature, a very short analysis of the policy upon which the legislation will be based. That is required by our regulations. Surely it is much better for a Minister to come to the Executive and say &quot;Here is what my Department wants to do. Here are the objectives.&quot; It is that type of approach that surely goes to the heart of it all.</p>
<p>Finally, I will deal with the question, which is legitimate given the airing that it has been given, though I am not sure that it is relevant to the statement about the review of public services, including local government.</p>
<p>That is something that we all agreed prior to the setting up of the Administration. We should all remember the interminable meetings that took place. It was agreed that public services as a whole needed to be reviewed, including local government. It cannot be done quickly or on a scanty basis. There will have to be independent input, there will have to be an enormous range of consultation, and in my view there will have to be a deep consensus for it to work properly.</p>

<p>Now the point of order from Dr Paisley.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.42" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90098" speakername="Rev Dr Ian Paisley" time="11:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>I thought that this statement today was about how the Government were going to bring in their legislation. Now the Minister is digressing and going on about something that he thinks should be done and should be done well. Well, he is certainly not doing well today with this <i>&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Order. That is an expression of the Member&rsquo;s views and not a point of order.</p>

<p>I welcome this statement, but I seek clarification on the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952 (Amendment) Bill. The statement refers to the promotion and development of Loughs Foyle and Carlingford and the licensing of aquaculture in the loughs. Does that mean Lough Foyle or the Foyle system?</p>
<p>Mention has been made of a possible relaxation of planning requirements for housing in rural areas. I urge that any such amendments be not at odds with any efforts that are being made to encourage rural diversification. Planning regulations should not hinder such diversification as may be necessary.</p>
<p>On the penultimate page, reference is made to transport and possible travel concessions. Current investigations are tending to look at the contribution that local government could make to this. There needs to be some uniformity. We should have a uniform state of affairs throughout Northern Ireland and not be dependent on how individual local authorities are prepared to support such a system.</p>
<p>Finally, there is talk of a new legislative framework to support modern and safe rail travel. I support that, but I would give it much greater support if it simply referred to modern and safe travel throughout Northern Ireland. It is all very well to introduce legislative frameworks, but if there is insufficient financial backing, it could become a burden on those who have responsibility for delivering particular services. I hope that the legislative framework has financial backup.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.45" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="11:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>The Member touched on four matters. First, with regard to Foyle fisheries, the existing legislation enacted in 1952 does not refer to Lough&nbsp;Foyle itself. My understanding is that the proposed legislation is intended to enhance the powers and functions of the Commission so that it can cover the Lough as well as the existing drainage base which feeds into the lough. Part of the reason for doing this is to enhance opportunities to develop aquaculture in Lough&nbsp;Foyle, which would be generally welcomed.</p>
<p>On the question of planning the legislation, it is hoped that when the Bill comes forward, it will strengthen the existing enforcement powers and streamline and clarify existing development control powers. That relates to the procedural aspect, rather than, as the Member said, to the policy that is then going to be dealt with. I hope that streamlining and clarifying control powers will also mean speedy decision making, which is clearly needed in this matter.</p>
<p>Reference was also made to a Railway Safety Bill, and a number of pertinent points were made by the Member about travel generally and the financing of it. As I understand it, we have very little information at the moment on the Railway Safety Bill, part of the object of which will be to update legislation which has remained unchanged in Northern Ireland for many decades. In recent decades, quite a bit of new legislation has come forward in Great Britain which has not been replicated here. While we do not yet have much information from the Department on the content of this proposed Bill, we are told that part of the objective is to update legislation and to introduce here measures that were introduced decades ago across the water.</p>
<p>Finally, the Member referred to travel concessions. He made a very pertinent point on the need for uniformity across Northern Ireland in matters of this nature. There is clearly a need for consistency, there is a need for coherence and there are policy issues behind such a proposal which have to be determined. Those policy issues have not yet been addressed, as far as I am aware, in the Executive, in Committee or in this Chamber, so it is not possible at this stage to make any comment about such legislation. The policy issues have not yet been addressed in a coherent and consistent manner as the Member would like.</p>

<p>I welcome the legislative programme. I want to home in on the public transport area and to pick up on the issue of free travel for pensioners. Pensioners want to see action from this Assembly. I know there is confusion about who would pay for this. There has been a pilot scheme involving Castlereagh and Newry councils in recent times. Pensioners want action. I urge the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to make sure that there is a bilateral discussion with the Department for Regional Development to bring this about.</p>

<p>I thank the Assembly Member for his comments. I can assure him that pensioners have an abiding interest in this matter. It will be a developing interest as it progresses. The purpose of the Bill will be to introduce free public transport schemes for older people &mdash; men and women of 65 or over &mdash; and to enable district councils to contribute to the cost of these schemes. This is a Bill that I favour personally for many reasons, but mostly because of the rural nature of Ulster. Most people realise that it is a day&rsquo;s work for people in rural areas, especially elderly people, to get to the nearest town because of the absence of the type of transport that there is in other places. It will be all the more welcome if this is developed in a way that allows elderly people to expand their interests and their lives. I understand that the Bill will enable councils to enter into agreements with the Department over contributions from the district rate to enable free travel schemes for older people to be administered. It will also enable district councils to enter into separate arrangements with transport operators to enable travel concessions for older people to be given. I welcome it and I think we all hope it proceeds quickly.</p>
<p>This is the type of good news that always comes out of an Administration at some point. We should value these good news stories because they apply to all of us, the entire political process. What we should not do with them is be even tempted to use them for party political reasons.</p>

<p>I welcome the inclusion of the Housing Bill in the legislative programme, and especially the fact that it will introduce regulatory functions for housing associations. We have been concerned that housing associations have fallen between two stools, with neither the housing associations branch nor the Housing Executive regulating them. There is some concern about the effectiveness of the services, which have been delivered by some of them in some places. I welcome clarification on the content of the Housing Bill.</p>
<p>I also note the attack that the Deputy First Minister made on the Ministers for Regional Development and Social Development in the penultimate paragraph of his statement. I thank him for his remarks because he has again demonstrated to the Assembly the First Minister&rsquo;s inability to deal with facts. Can he reaffirm that DUP Ministers are not sitting in Government with Sinn Féin, as we pledged in our manifesto? Does he also agree that there are a number of Bills from both DUP Ministers in the legislative programme and that there is very firm evidence that they are doing their jobs in delivering services to people in Northern Ireland? Does he also agree that it is a bit rich that the Deputy First Minister to lecture anyone about abstention, given the record of his party over the last 30 years? It abstained from Stormont, periodically from councils, the Prior Assembly and the Police Authority, and, of course, the Deputy First Minister himself resigned about a year ago in a fit of pique. Is this another example of the hypocrisy of the SDLP, or, during the holidays, has the Deputy First Minister been down the road to Damascus on the question of abstention.</p>

<p>I welcome the Member&rsquo;s comments about our being in a new beginning that is different from what happened in the past. I hope that he and his party will play a full part in that new beginning, rather than simply replicating past behaviour.</p>
<p>I heard a sedentary comment from a Member about things that happened in the past, which he disapproved of. Clearly, as far as other parties are concerned, those things are not happening now. That underlines the new beginning that we are representing.</p>
<p>On his substantive question, I was very interested in his reference to housing associations. Having been a member of a housing association, I am aware of the tremendous, positive contribution they have made to the provision of social housing and how important they might be in the future. I listened with interest to the Member&rsquo;s indications that there would be measures relating to housing associations in the Bill. I cannot confirm whether that is the case. The limited briefing from the Department says that the Bill will provide, among other things, new arrangements for housing regulation, powers to provide serviced sites for travellers, discretionary grant schemes for private rented renewal and measures to deal with antisocial behaviour. The reference to the provision of new arrangements for housing regulation may well involve some reference to housing associations, but I cannot say if that is the case. The Member will have to pursue the matter elsewhere.</p>
<p>I went into detail on that matter because the claim that DUP Ministers are doing their jobs is slightly undermined by the fact that we are not being fully briefed on the content of this legislation. I am quoting from the material available to me. That is pertinent. I would be delighted to hear more about the legislation and that will happen if DUP Ministers do their jobs. Let us be clear about what is and what is not happening. Although DUP Ministers fail to attend Executive meetings, which are important, they go into their offices, sit behind their desks and are therefore part of the Government. They sit down in the Government with other people who are in the Administration, even if they continue to draw the entirely spurious distinction about who or who is not in the same room.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the DUP members who last Friday were sitting down in the Long Gallery with Sinn Fein recognised their presence there.</p>

<p>I welcome the proposed planning legislation. We need it urgently. I seek an assurance that we will have clear planning policies, not notes or vision statements, which will ensure sustainable development and give due weight to the views of the public and elected representatives and to the need for legislation to be enforced especially against unapproved development.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.4.54" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#4">
<p>Unapproved development is something which has blighted Northern Ireland for a considerable time. You built and then you threw down a challenge to the planning service to enforce its legislation. And how often did it do that? That is almost the ethic that exists in the North of Ireland: build it and you will get away with it, because sooner or later the planning service will give in. This must be looked at very carefully. I welcome what Ms Hanna has said about planning, but I am not convinced that there is an adequate planning policy.</p>
<p>Planning policies are needed, because I am not sure that one policy can be properly applied throughout the North of Ireland and at the same time be adequate for the type of diversity that we have in employment terms, in environmental terms, and indeed in social terms. I make one last observation, which is crucial: the social element of planning has to be very carefully looked at, because it is that which is causing many problems for people who live in urban areas. They are becoming more obvious, and it is not enough just to import bright ideas for physical planning without applying them to the social needs of the area to which they are to relate. If we get that type of approach into planning, it will be less of an exercise and more of a construction between the community and the political process.</p>

<p>I beg to move</p>
<p class="small">That this Assembly appoints an Ad Hoc Committee to consider the draft Regulations laid by the Secretary of State under the Flags (Northern Ireland) Order 2000 and to submit a report to the Assembly by 16 October 2000.</p>
<p class="small">Composition: UUP 2<br /> SDLP 2<br /> DUP 2<br /> SF 2<br /> Other parties 3</p>
<p class="small">Quorum: The quorum shall be five.</p>
<p class="small">Procedure: The procedures of the Committee shall be such as the Committee shall determine.</p>
<p>This is a technical procedure. Members will already have received a copy of the Flags (Northern Ireland) 2000 from the Secretary of State. We need to deal with this as quickly and as efficiently as possible. There are a number of major issues concerning accommodation for and servicing of the Committee, and we need to have the work completed quickly.</p>
<p>Some Members who will serve on this Committee will also serve in other places and may have to try to be in two or three places at once. For that reason &mdash; and I know that a counter-proposal has been made that the Committee should have 20 members &mdash; this Committee should have 11 members, in accordance with the motion.</p>

<p>I beg to move the following amendment standing in my name and that of Mr Ford: Delete from &quot;Composition&quot; to &quot;five.&quot; and add</p>
<p class="small">&quot;Composition: UUP 4<br /> SDLP 4<br /> DUP 3<br /> SF 3<br /> Alliance 1<br /> NIUP 1<br /> UUAP 1<br /> NIWC 1<br /> PUP 1</p>
<p class="small">Quorum: The quorum shall be eight.&quot;</p>
<p>The first point that we wish to make relates to the regulations under the Order. They are extremely important for the work of this Assembly and are, of course, extremely contentious. Many of us believe that it is a tragedy that we should have to debate the issue of the national flag&rsquo;s flying over Government buildings in part of the United Kingdom. The reason we are having to debate this is that, in breach of the election manifestos of the First Minister&rsquo;s party, Sinn Féin/IRA Ministers have been put into positions in the Government, with full executive responsibility. That is clearly where the blame lies for our having to have this debate.</p>
<p>So far as this Committee is concerned it is important that these issues be given the fullest possible consideration. In terms of its make-up, the amendment is based upon the previous make-up of the Ad Hoc Committee that was set up to deal with the future of the port of Belfast. We have a precedent for the make-up of an Ad Hoc Committee, and we should abide by that precedent.</p>
<p>Finally, there are practical considerations to be taken into account. On an issue such as this it will be extremely difficulty to ask the smaller parties somehow to find three representatives to sit on the Committee.</p>
<p>This is clearly an issue in which each of the parties will have its particular interest and point of view. It would therefore be invidious, if not impossible, to come to an arrangement whereby one party gave up its place in favour of another. Since this issue is so controversial and of such importance, and because of the precedent already established, I hope the House will support the amendment.</p>

<p>A Ceann Comhairle, it is somewhat surprising that such a motion must come before the Assembly, for we understood that the issue was to be dealt with by the Executive. I am not aware that the Executive has concluded its deliberations. Nonetheless, we are being sent regulations by the Secretary of State, and I am sure we can all speculate on the political nature of their timing.</p>
<p>We would have supported the initial proposal by the SDLP that there be a smaller Committee, mainly because of the pressure on Assembly Members, time, rooms and staff, something outlined at recent meetings of the Business Committee. However, it would be somewhat akin to looking a gift horse in the mouth to refuse a proposal from Members from the DUP that our membership on such a Committee be increased. I therefore thank them for that kind offer.</p>
<p>I look forward to sitting down with them in the Committee to debate this issue. We shall approach it on the basis of what was quite clearly said about the new institutions&rsquo; flags in the Good Friday Agreement, and not on what follows from the agreement or what others try to interpret from or append to it. We look forward to the debate. We are not opposed to the DUP amendment, the effect of which will be to increase our membership on the Committee, which must be welcomed. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

<p>If the Member wishes to speak to the substance of the issue, but not to the substance of the Order itself, he may indicate his wish to be called. However, that is not a point of order.

<p>My party will not support the amendment or the initial proposal from the SDLP Member, Dr Alasdair McDonnell. The Northern Ireland Unionist Party will comprise a part neither of the Committee proposed by the SDLP nor of that proposed by Mr Dodds and Mr Ford. Our objection to participating in the Committees is based on the firm belief that sitting on a Committee, be it Executive, ad hoc or otherwise, is unacceptable now that this Assembly has moved from shadow to substance and includes two Ministers fronting a terrorist organisation, which continues to strike fear into the people of this Province. We shall not have any truck with Committees set up under the Belfast Agreement. My Colleague Ms Pauline Armitage is quite right.</p>
<p>At the time of the signing of the agreement, we were told by Mr David Trimble, the First Minister, and by Mr Ervine of the PUP that the issues of our constitutional position and the flying of flags had been resolved. I remember the PUP representative, who fronts a Protestant paramilitary organisation, leading a cavalcade of cars down the Shankill Road claiming victory for the people of Northern Ireland in their defence of the Union and saying the Union was now secure. It is a sad state of affairs that in Northern Ireland today we are talking about forming a Committee to discuss the flag of this nation and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s position in the United Kingdom, a Committee which would include two members of Sinn Féin, an organisation still in armed conflict with this Province&rsquo;s forces of law and order and, indeed, with ordinary, decent citizens &mdash; both Catholic and Protestant. The Northern Ireland Unionist Party will not participate, and I respectfully ask that my party&rsquo;s name be removed.</p>

<p>I am quite prepared to deal with that question. I had hoped the Member would understand when I said that the moment the policy changed for the Northern Ireland Unionist Party was when the Assembly moved from shadow to substance &mdash; it no longer simply a place to voice one&rsquo;s opinion. We now have in the Government, and in Committees, people who are armed and fully prepared to use violence.</p>

<p>I will finish by saying that if you throw a stone into a pack of dogs, the one that howls the hardest is the one that has been hit. Mr&nbsp;Robinson&rsquo;s election literature, like Mr&nbsp;Trimble&rsquo;s, showed a photograph of Mr&nbsp;Trimble and Mr&nbsp;Adams with the caption &quot;Who will share power with Sinn Féin in the New Northern Ireland Assembly?&quot; Who would have believed that it would be Mr&nbsp;Robinson and Mr&nbsp;Dodds?

<p>I am also surprised that this motion is before the House. I understood that in the Belfast Agreement Nationalists and Republicans accepted that Northern Ireland was, and would remain, part of the United Kingdom. If so, why are we now discussing the flying of the Union flag in this part of the United Kingdom? Obviously this is another mishap in the Belfast Agreement.</p>

<p>I would like to put on record that my party voted against this in the House of Commons. A country does nothing for its sovereignty by having to pass a law which allows its flag to be flown on certain occasions. The national flag should be honoured on all occasions.</p>

<p>Order. I must again make it clear that this motion &mdash; and the Member referred to voting against this in another place &mdash; is not about the content or the piece of legislation. It is a purely business motion about the establishment of a Committee and the proportion of its members. This Committee, if it is established, will have to report to the Assembly, and Members will have the opportunity at that stage to debate the substance.</p>

<p>Order. The Member knows that he is straying on to the substance of the matter to be debated. There will be a time for that in the Committee and when it returns to the House, if the Assembly decides to proceed in that way. I cannot permit debate on the substance itself. Even defending the record of his party or of his colleagues is to stray from the specific proposal put forward by his party Colleague, Mr Dodds.</p>

<p>I am trying to talk about why we should have a larger Committee. I am entitled to give reasons for that. This is what this debate is about. There is an amendment to the motion before the House, that was moved by my party and others who have associated with us, which would have the effect of making the Committee larger. I am surely allowed to give reasons for that.</p>
<p>This Committee should be larger because of the legislation it is going to discuss. This legislation is outrageous. Surely every Member in the House should have a say in this Committee. The Secretary of State &mdash;</p>

<p>Does the Member accept that a larger Committee will have more people of the Unionist persuasion on it and that that will reflect the balance of opinion in this country? It is to the benefit of Unionism to have a larger Committee.</p>

<p>Of course it is to the benefit of the Unionism, but the issue here is the Executive. We have been told by Sinn Féin, who sit on this Executive, which my party does not, that this was never dealt with. Why did they not deal with this matter? They did not deal with it because they knew perfectly well that they would not get agreement. Sinn Féin/IRA has already made decisions, which is why we are here today: Sinn Fein/IRA Ministers refuse to fly the flag, in keeping with law, on certain days.</p>
<p>We need a larger Committee &mdash; and I am coming back to this larger Committee, Sir, for I do not want you to pull your moustache off, Mr Speaker &mdash; because this Bill can get round the question that we are supposed to be dealing with, the flying of the Union flag. The Sinn Féin Ministers think that by declaring that there are no flagpoles on their buildings they can ensure that the Union flag cannot be flown. It is optional in this Bill, and this is a very serious matter. What is more &mdash;</p>

<p>Does not my hon Friend find the intemperate language used by the so-called leader of the Northern Ireland Unionist Party remarkable, considering one of his colleagues, Mr&nbsp;Paddy&nbsp;Roche, sat with Sinn Féin/IRA on a Committee dealing with the port of Belfast? It is all the more peculiar that he seems to suggest that Sinn Féin/IRA only became bad boys after devolution occurred. I do not know where he was before that. Is it not all the more remarkable considering that Members who are now in the NIUP sat on the Procedures Committee which set up these very Committees? They never objected to the presence of Sinn Féin and never said that they would not be on the Committees, yet they voted for everybody else to be on the Committees. Is that not sheer hypocrisy?</p>

<p>I leave it to the general public to make their own judgement on this matter. This issue is all-important. Already, because of the refusal of the Official Unionist Party to do its duty on the Executive, it has been brought to Mr&nbsp;Mandelson, brought to the House of Commons and brought here. This is another attempt to push Unionism down.</p>

<p>The issue that Mr&nbsp;Paisley refers to was brought before the Executive Committee. I was one of the people who raised the matter. It is not any fault of the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>

<p>Order. Points of order have to be points of order. I assume that Members know what that means. Perhaps we are having difficulty getting back into things after the summer recess. If not, and if it becomes clear that Members press the point, I will be forced to ask Members to declare which Standing Order they are referring to. If Members wish to make political points, which is entirely justifiable, they should ask for the opportunity to speak.</p>

<p>If the Minister brought up a matter in the Executive, that shows that it was not before the Executive. The First Minister did not bring this to the Executive, and the issue was not voted on. We are here today because of the failure of the Unionist Party to do its duty in this so-called Executive. We are setting up a Committee that is not representative of the people of Northern Ireland. Surely this Committee, given the importance of the issue, should be as representative as the Committee that dealt with the ports issue. This is more important than ports.</p>
<p>This motion should never have been needed. It is needed because the power of Mr&nbsp;Trimble ended when the two IRA/Sinn Féin Ministers rebelled and refused to fly the flag that should have been flying. Because they refused to fly the flag, we are going to have to deal with this matter. My party is not running away from the IRA or anybody else, but we will not sit down in any Executive to govern Northern Ireland with IRA/Sinn Féin. Our position is perfectly clear. Of course, we have sat on councils with IRA/Sinn Féin and fought them, and we have sat here and battled with them, and we will battle with them again.</p>
<p>This motion &mdash; I know that you do not want me to mention the contents, Mr Speaker &mdash; is a way for the two Sinn Féin Members to ensure that the Union flag will never fly on Government buildings. The head of state down below thinks that, without protocol, she can trip in and out of Northern Ireland. This motion will enable the tricolour to be flown on Government buildings. That is not an option, but the flag of this country is an option in this motion. Those are things we utterly detest. If people are interested, we should have the same type of Committee that we had for the ports.</p>

<p>Order. I have been asked for clarification on a point of order. I can only take from the content of the amendment which has come forward in respect of composition that most, if not all, parties are able to be represented, although, as we have heard, not all may necessarily choose to be represented.</p>

<p>Then it is not a point of order. Points of order may be raised only with myself. Of course, Dr&nbsp;Paisley may choose to respond as he brings his remarks to a close.</p>

<p>I have responded. Where Sinn Féin are, we will be battling with them. We will not take sides with them in their diabolical murder campaign in this Province.</p>
<p>Finally, why is this House, which is always boasting that we are all democrats, afraid of a Committee that represents the voters of Northern Ireland in a proper way? Why? Simply because the Official Unionists do not want united Unionist opposition to this disastrous and treacherous proposal.</p>

<p>This is probably going to be one of the most difficult issues we face, and, Mr Speaker, your decision that we do not start the debate here but keep it for the Committee is appropriate. I stand in favour of the amendment because our party supports a more inclusive make-up of that Committee &mdash; the more inclusive the debate the better. We have already heard the diversity of opinion across the Chamber on this issue. It is useful, therefore, that if there are a number of parties who might have been left out of that debate the amendment allows for their inclusion.</p>
<p>This morning in the Long Gallery there was a very good launch of Women Together incorporating People Moving On. The title of the organisation suggests the kind of things that it wants this Assembly to address, and moving on is indeed what we must do. Difficult as this issue is, it is appropriate that the Secretary of State has referred it to the parties. They are the people who must ultimately decide this difficult issue.</p>
<p>The amendment does not refer to that part of the motion which states</p>
<p class="small">&quot;The procedures of the Committee shall be such as the Committee shall determine.&quot;</p>
<p>Our party is in favour of that too.</p>

<p>Can you give an assurance, Mr Speaker, that, whatever this Committee reports, there will be a full debate on the Floor of the House and that adequate time will be provided for that debate? The Member mentioned something about having it in the Committee. This has to come back to the House, which must have a full and free debate. There are people who will not be on the Committee, and they must have their say on this issue.</p>

<p>I can confirm that in terms of the original motion, or indeed the motion as proposed to be amended, that the Assembly will have to receive a report by 16&nbsp;October. It will be for the Business Committee to allocate time, and it would be out of order for me to determine matters which the Business Committee properly decides upon in advance of its making that decision.</p>

<p>It seems that this debate, whether on the original motion or the amendment, has generated a great deal of heat and discussion about something which in the end is really pretty valueless. It is quite clear that any recommendation made by this Committee or the Assembly may be totally ignored by the Secretary of State. He will make his decision in accordance with what he deems to be expedient for British policy in relation to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The role of this Committee and the Assembly is of the merest consultative kind and carries no weight of any substance. Therefore whether it is a smaller or a larger Committee is of no great moment.</p>
<p>However, let me point out that neither original motion nor the amendment would result in the inclusion of a representative from the United Kingdom Unionist Party, even though members of that party numbered five when elected by the people of Northern Ireland and before a rather bizarre process of bifurcation, after which Mr&nbsp;Wilson constituted himself the head of a party that many people believed to be a figment of his imagination.</p>

<p>Order. A point of order was raised, and I trust the Member wants to hear my ruling on it.

<p>Perhaps the Member would wait until I have completed giving the ruling.</p>
<p>It would not be in the gift of the leader of the NIUP to appoint someone else to that Committee who was not a member of his party and who shows no indication of becoming a member of his party, even if he were minded to accept the generous offer. In fairness we should move on.</p>

<p>It is a matter of some anxiety to note the number of utterly bogus points of order that are made in the Assembly. I have sympathy for you, Mr&nbsp;Speaker, in dealing with them. A masterclass for slow learners with regard to what constitutes a point of order should have featured in the legislation for the Assembly. We have just had a demonstration of one of the more bogus points of order that have plagued us since the beginning.</p>
<p>My party may consist of only myself within this House, but it certainly consists of a significant number of people outside compared to the numbers in some other parties who are on the schedule for participation in the Committee. I do regard it as a compliment that I have not been included in the original motion or the amendment. There was no provision for my party to be represented on the Ad Hoc Committee for the Port of Belfast, and there is no such provision for a representative of the United Kingdom Unionist Party to sit on this Committee. That is both an overt and a tacit acknowledgement that the party I lead has been entirely consistent.</p>

<p>Not only was that another bogus point of order, the authority for which the learned Member was totally incapable of identifying, it was also evidence that he does not even have his historical facts correct. I am sure the leader of the Alliance Party will support me in this. Shortly after the appointment of Members to the Ad Hoc Committee on the Port of Belfast he told me that no representative of the United Kingdom Unionist Party had been appointed to that Committee. With regard to Mr Wilson&rsquo;s analysis of the points of order and his historical record, it seems that there is a want of either memory or consciousness on the part of my Friend.</p>
<p>Let me return to the principle. The reason there is a spat between some Members of the House over their virility in opposing any contact with Sinn&nbsp;Féin is that there has been, to some extent, a degree of inconsistency.</p>
<p>My opponents will appreciate that, whatever else can be said about my conduct in this House, at least it has been consistent on the principle of having no contact or association with those parties who are the political representatives of armed terrorists groups, whether they be orange, green, polka dotted or any other colour, real or imaginary, provisional or final. My party has made its position quite clear.</p>
<p>I wish it were otherwise and that I could have some social or other contact with many Members from those parties. However, on the fundamental principle that while they continue to represent terrorist groups in possession of arms, that is an absolute bar, as far as my party is concerned, to having any association with them.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>There are people here who wring their hands and make all sorts of pious statements about their associations and about what they would like to happen. However, they are only here because the godfathers of murderous terrorists operating in the Province sanctioned them to be here. They are only here as long as they abide by the directions of those godfathers.</p>
<p>As far as this Committee is concerned, I am proud that I have not been and will not be nominated to serve on the Committee as constituted either by the original motion or by the amendment. Until the House takes a fundamental stand on the principles of democracy that is absolute and consistent, these difficulties and spats between parties will continue.</p>
<p>So I take no hurt from not being nominated for this Committee. I take it as a matter of pride that at least my opponents recognise, whether they agree with my position or are opposed to it, that at least it is consistent.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.5.76" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90116" speakername="Mr Peter Weir" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#5">
<p>With the exception of Mr McCartney, I am probably the person in the House least likely to be nominated to this Committee so I will not be given the opportunity to reject or accept a place. Like Mr&nbsp;McCartney I hope I can bring a degree of objectivity to the two questions before us. There will be an opportunity at a later stage to deal with the substance of the issue over flags.</p>
<p>The first question raised by the leader of the Northern Ireland Unionist Party, Cedric&nbsp;Wilson, was whether we should have a Committee at all. The second question, which is the subject of the amendment, is the nature of its composition.</p>
<p>With regard to the first question, I share the views of a lot of Members who say that it is a great shame that we must have a Committee because this is an issue which should have been sorted out before now.</p>
<p>It is a sorry state of affairs when there are restrictions placed on the flying of the Union flag. The Secretary of State will be making the final determination on the flags issue and, as Mr McCartney said, it is likely he will ignore what he is told by the Assembly and come to his own conclusion. However, it is vital that the Assembly gives its view on the issue.</p>
<p>While the Committee may well be consultative, it is important that it be established. If the Secretary of State reaches his own conclusions regardless of the Assembly&rsquo;s wishes, he will clearly be seen to be doing so against the will of the people of Northern Ireland as represented through the Members of the House. We will then be able to expose him on this issue. Therefore it is important that we have a Committee.</p>
<p>Regarding the composition of the Committee, we are constantly being lectured &mdash; particularly by the SDLP, who, I note, are taking a very contrary view to the amendment &mdash; that the Assembly is all about inclusiveness and inclusion. Those seem to be the sacred words of the New Northern Ireland Assembly and the supposed new dispensation. However, today we are being told that a number of smaller parties will be excluded from the Committee dealing with the vital issue of flags.</p>
<p>As happened before in respect of the Port of Belfast Committee, we ought to be looking for a Committee that reflects as widely as possible the views of the Assembly. There will be diverging views on the flag issue. The united Unionists will put forward one view, and the Women&rsquo;s Coalition, I assume, will take a very different view. While we have Standing Committees, which reflect the balance of the Assembly, we have had the precedence of the Port of Belfast Committee, which indicated that the widest possible representation on a Committee is beneficial and will lead to the most divergent views being represented.</p>
<p>I take exception to some of the remarks made by Dr McDonnell in opposing the amendment. He said that a problem would arise due to the workload of Committee members, and that there would be a danger of Committee members being on two Committees at the one time. That would be serious if we were dealing with a Committee that was going to sit for the lifetime of the Assembly. However, we are dealing with a Committee that will be due to report to the Assembly in a month&rsquo;s time &mdash; a very short time. Under those circumstances it should not be beyond the ingenuity of Members to organise Committee meetings so that they do not clash, and in so doing we can ensure that we have a proper debate and an informed report on the flag issue.</p>
<p>Therefore I urge Members, in the spirit of inclusiveness, to support the amendment because it offers a better procedural way forward than the initial motion.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.5.77" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90045" speakername="Mr David Ford" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#5">
<p>I disagree with some of the remarks made by the proposer of the amendment. I am sure Mr&nbsp;Dodds would be disappointed if I did not disagree with some of his opening remarks about Sinn Féin. Nonetheless, I welcome the new commitment to inclusivity, which has been demonstrated this morning by the DUP. This came as a shock to some Members.</p>
<p>Those of us who are members of Antrim Borough Council saw this inclusivity demonstrated at the annual meeting in June. The Ulster Unionist Party made its traditional attempt to grab all the committee chairs despite the fact that it represented half of the council membership. However, by dint of an agreement between the DUP and those normally regarded as opposition, we were able to ensure some more balance and fairness. Perhaps this is a sign of DUP conversion to inclusivity, and I welcome it. I am delighted to support those parts of Dr McDonnell&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>However, I was surprised at the way in which he put forward this resolution in the first place. For 30 years the SDLP has talked a lot about equality, fairness and inclusivity. However, in the Business Committee the SDLP, by procedural means, railroaded through the motion in the form in which it first appeared. That did not cause any difficulty to the larger parties but it excluded some of the smaller parties. If we are talking about inclusivity, then that is not a very realistic or fair way to proceed. Dr&nbsp;McDonnell thinks that there would be difficulties for the larger parties in staffing a committee, yet it was raised in the Business Committee that we could have a weighted voting system as, for example, the Business Committee and the Commission.</p>
<p>The SDLP would not be required to have four people sitting in the Committee at all times, and they could still cast their votes. Unfortunately inclusivity seems to have switched from the parties currently to my right to the parties currently to my left. I hope we can introduce the idea all round the Chamber.</p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;McCartney, who unfortunately is not here &mdash; and he tells us a lot about good manners&nbsp;&mdash; to listen to the winding-up speeches, said that today&rsquo;s procedure was valueless. It may or may not be valueless. We will know when we see the report and how the Secretary of State deals with it. Today&rsquo;s debate will be very valuable if it emphasises that this Chamber can start to agree on what inclusivity means. So far as I am concerned, we are here to work for a pluralist society, not the kind of dualist society which seems to be the preference of some sections of the SDLP. As long as they cobble together a deal with the Ulster Unionists, the rest of us can fall in with it. The only way we can work towards a pluralist society is if every party in the Chamber is properly represented on special Committees like this.</p>
<p>I do not have a problem, so far as my party is concerned, if there are only three seats for the parties other than the four largest and if we, as the largest section of that group, have one of them. As Mr&nbsp;Weir has said, there are difficulties with expecting people to represent others. I have managed to co-operate on certain practical issues with members of the other smaller parties, but I do think it would be fair to ask Mr&nbsp;Watson to represent me on the flying of the Union flag, unless his views have changed a lot recently.</p>
<p>If we are to be inclusive, if we are to get balance, fairness and openness, we must have a large and inclusive Committee. We already have the precedent in the Port of Belfast Committee. There is no excuse whatsoever for narrowing it down. That could only be seen as an attempt to diminish the rights of smaller parties in the Chamber. I urge Dr&nbsp;McDonnell to listen to the views which have come from this end of the Chamber, to accept the amendment and to let us see a bit of inclusivity all round after today&rsquo;s debate.</p>

<p>I have always treated Mr&nbsp;Ford with respect, courtesy and kindness, but in view of his brutal attack on me and my views, I may have to reconsider that. However, I am happy to accept the amendment.</p>
<p>The SDLP was not going out slashing at people and trying to exclude and marginalise them. The motion was worded as it was quite simply in view of a number of the items that were brought to the Committee on Tuesday. There are considerable problems in the House at the moment in terms of staff, space and function. Our concern was driven merely by the fact that a bigger Committee would be harder to work with, but in the interests of inclusivity I am very happy that it should be larger.</p>
<p>I could answer many things that have been said, but it would be superfluous. I regret that what was purely a piece of technical business here this morning has resulted in much ugly washing of dirty linen among some of the smaller Unionist parties and the DUP. If we in this House want to be taken seriously, we must get beyond the inconsistencies and take ourselves seriously on these issues on which we disagree.</p>
<p>There are a number of points, particularly one made by Mr&nbsp;Weir about what I said. The reality is that many Members have to double up and do some of the work that Mr&nbsp;Weir has opted out of. That is why some people have to serve on two or three Committees. I am quite happy to accept the amendment and allow it to become the substantive motion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.6.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90020" speakername="Mr Gregory Campbell" speakeroffice="The Minister for Regional Development" time="12:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#6">
<p>Information about cryptosporidium and its effects is in the public domain. However, I would like to explain briefly the nature of cryptosporidium, outline the history of the present outbreak and explain the way that the Department has been working with the Eastern Health and Social Services Board in responding to the outbreak. I also want to assure Members of the seriousness with which I and all involved regard this present problem and express my sympathy to all those affected.</p>
<p>Cryptosporidium is a parasitic organism which can be water-borne and is resistant to normal disinfection processes. Cryptosporidium can cause serious ill health, although normally in humans it is self-limiting and clears within two to three weeks. For those people whose immune systems are weakened or compromised, it can be much more serious. The first reported UK outbreak associated with public water supplies was in 1988. Following a further outbreak in 1989, the Government appointed a group of experts, who reported in 1990 and in 1995 on measures to mitigate the risk of cryptosporidium in the public water supply. Their recommendations were adopted by the Water Service.</p>
<p>The group further reported in 1998 and made over 50 revised recommendations, one of which was that water utilities carry out risk assessments on all their supplies. In early 1999 the Water Service assessed the risk of contamination at all 59 sources then in use in Northern Ireland. The methodology used was based on models used in England, Wales and Scotland and developed in consultation with the Northern Ireland drinking water inspector.</p>
<p>This assessment identified the Silent Valley as the only source with a risk factor that indicated the need for continuous sampling and analysis during the spring, which is the highest-risk period. A further 22 sources were identified as having lower risk factors, but at these sources it was considered prudent to undertake single 24-hour sampling of both raw and treated water in both spring and autumn of each year. Similar 24-hour samples of both raw and treated water are taken at the remaining sources each spring. I must emphasis that the risk assessments are based on the protocol used in Scotland and that the associated testing regimes are fully in line with those required by cryptosporidium regulations in England and Wales and by direction in Scotland. These arrangements have been agreed by the drinking water inspector and the chief medical officer.</p>
<p>Having given Members the background information, I would like to turn now to the recently detected outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the Lisburn and Poleglass areas.</p>
<p>During the week beginning 21 August 2000 the Eastern Health and Social Services Board became aware of a number of cases of crytosporidiosis in the Poleglass area. By 25&nbsp;August there were more than 20 confirmed cases, and an outbreak control team had been established. The outbreak control team is chaired by the consultant for communicable disease control (CCDC) and includes representatives of the Water Service. Investigation and control of the outbreak is the responsibility of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board. The Water Service role is to assist the CCDC in every possible way, taking steps to identify any possible contamination of the public water supply and measures to limit the impact on the community. In accordance with established procedures for dealing with major incidents, the Water Service set up control teams in eastern division and at head office.</p>
<p>The Water Service began sampling for crytosporidium oocysts at Poleglass reservoir on 22&nbsp;August. Although by 25 August there was no test evidence to link the outbreak to the public water supply, the CCDC decided to issue a precautionary notice advising the elderly and those suffering from serious medical conditions to boil their water before consumption. A press statement to this effect was issued on 25 August.</p>
<p>Continued sampling of water from the reservoir, in the period 25 to 29 August, revealed increasing levels of cryptosporidium in the water supply, and the outbreak control team, acting diligently and methodically in accordance with agreed protocols, decided on the evening of 30&nbsp;August 2000 that a &quot;boil water&quot; notice should be issued to customers within the Poleglass reservoir supply zone. The CCDC, on the morning of 31 August 2000, issued a press statement to this effect and later that day Water Service staff hand delivered 17,500 &quot;boil water&quot; notices to affected households.</p>
<p>By 31 August the Water Service had established that a number of the confirmed cases lived in the supply zone served by the neighbouring Northern Service reservoir, and the decision was taken to issue &quot;boil water&quot; notices to all remaining customers supplied with water from the Forked Bridge treatment works through the Lagmore conduit. These were delivered the following day.</p>
<p>Approximately 28,500 &quot;boil water&quot; notices were delivered to households, schools and industrial and business premises in the Poleglass, North Lisburn, Twinbrook, Dunmurry and surrounding areas. An estimated 90,000 people were affected by the notice. Water Service and Eastern Board customer help-lines have been in place since the start of the outbreak to provide information to members of the public who have concerns about the &quot;boil water&quot; notices or any other matters. The Water Service has provided bottled water, on request, to nursing and residential homes. Bottled water has also been provided to schools by the education and library boards.</p>
<p>Water Service investigations of possible sources of contamination concentrated on the Lagmore conduit &mdash; a brick conduit approximately seven miles long. This conduit, which is 110&nbsp;years old, carries water from the Forked Bridge treatment works to the service reservoirs. Detailed investigations of the conduit, including using CCTV in a section pinpointed by bacteriological sampling, confirmed that there had been ingress and contamination of the treated water. Further investigation revealed that the conduit had been damaged when an outfall was being laid from a private septic tank attached to a property built in the last few years. This damage has been repaired and the conduit sealed at this point. However, investigations will continue until the Water Service is satisfied that there are no other sources of contamination.</p>
<p>Consistent with the need to maintain the water supply at all times, an intensive programme of cleansing the service reservoirs is underway. This is a huge task &mdash; for example, the Poleglass service reservoir holds almost 10 million gallons. It is 16 ft deep and the size of one and a half football pitches.</p>
<p>As part of the ongoing programme to replace and upgrade ageing infrastructure, work commenced in April this year on a £2·5 million contract to replace the entire brick conduit with a modern ductile iron pipeline. The new pipeline was programmed to be brought in to service in November, but it has been decided to utilise a section of it to provide a bypass of the suspect area of the existing conduit. This bypass should be completed by the end of this week.</p>
<p>I now move to the removal of &quot;boil water&quot; notices. It will be for the outbreak control team to decide when the notice may be lifted. This decision will be informed by test sample results and geographical analysis of clinical evidence from the affected areas.</p>
<p>I am fully satisfied that all involved in controlling this outbreak and investigating its cause have acted correctly, swiftly and in accordance with agreed protocols. In less than a week from the initial indication that the water supply was implicated, the entire system had been thoroughly investigated, a source of contamination had been detected, the conduit had been repaired and sealed, reservoirs are being cleaned, and works are ongoing to link the old conduit to the newly constructed pipeline.</p>
<p>I pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff in the Water Service, other Departments and agencies and, in particular, the consultant for communicable disease control, the Chief Medical Officer and the members of the outbreak control team. The way they have handled the enormous workload arising from this incident has demonstrated their great commitment and service to the community.</p>
<p>My officials will continue to consistently work with the other members of the team to take every possible step to enable the &quot;boil water&quot; notices to be lifted and normal water supply to be restored to our customers at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>I described earlier how the Silent Valley had been identified as the source which was at highest risk of contamination by cryptosporidium when the risk assessment was undertaken last year. The Silent Valley reservoir serves approximately 250,000 people.</p>
<p>To protect the quality of water entering the public supply from this source the Water Service, earlier this year, temporarily excluded sheep from its land, which includes the catchment area, as spring is recognised as being the period of greatest risk. The temporary exclusion period was subsequently extended.</p>
<p>A further review of the management of the Silent Valley catchment has shown the need to continue to exclude the sheep, and I therefore had no alternative but to announce last week that the exclusion must continue. I understand fully the difficulties this will cause for local farmers, and I sympathise with their position. My officials have been liaising and will continue to liaise with officials from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to establish what measures can be taken to assist those farmers. I regret having to take this decision, but it is unavoidable owing to the interest in public health. Who in this House would do otherwise?</p>
<p>On completion of the new £35&nbsp;million water-treatment works for the Silent Valley, the position regarding future grazing will be reviewed. This is scheduled for completion in the financial year 2003. That investment, coupled with the ongoing £32 million replacement of the Mourne conduit, which carries the water from the Silent Valley, demonstrates the Department&rsquo;s commitment to continue the delivery of wholesome drinking water to our customers.</p>
<p>Finally, the provision of adequate water and sewerage services is important to everyone in Northern Ireland, whether a domestic consumer, a commercial or industrial user, a farmer, a fisherman, an environmentalist or someone concerned with public health issues. The Water Service has suffered significant underfunding over the last 20 years. On the basis of assessments derived from an asset management plan completed in 1993, the Water Service needs to invest approximately £3&nbsp;billion over the next 20 years to replace out-of-date infrastructure, meet the needs of new development that satisfies public health requirements, and comply with European directives on drinking water and waste water.</p>
<p>Recent events, including the flooding in Belfast, have confirmed just how essential it is to raise the funding of the Water Service to levels which will enable the provision of a service that meets the requirements and needs of all our customers in the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s thorough and detailed statement in relation to this very serious problem that has affected the people of Lisburn, Poleglass and Lagmore, and I want to thank him for the detailed and frank way in which he has dealt with this issue. At my request he willingly arranged for an official to attend a Committee meeting and present a very thorough and detailed report. I am sure that all Members are very mindful of the suffering, distress and worry caused to those affected by this outbreak, and the House should extend its sympathy to all of them. It is particularly worrying for parents of small children and for those with elderly relatives, and I am sure all Members would agree that we feel deeply for them.</p>
<p>The report from Mr&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;Martin was very detailed.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Madam Deputy&nbsp;Speaker. Loath as I am on this occasion to rise against the Chairman of my Committee, I must draw attention to your reference to the limited time scale for this matter. Many of us wish to ask questions. Can Members be directed to ask questions rather than make statements?</p>
</speech>

<p>In relation to the overall problem, can the Minister assure the House that he believes that the Department&rsquo;s officials acted as promptly as they could, given the circumstances of this outbreak?</p>
<p>From reading the press and listening to local reaction, I know that members of the public felt that officials could perhaps have acted earlier. I would like the Minister to reassure the House that they acted as promptly as they could, given all the circumstances.</p>
<p>Can the Minister confirm if the contamination source is human? Is he satisfied that the septic tank referred to in the report is the source of contamination, and the only source of contamination? Is he satisfied that all possible remedial work has been carried out in order to provide a safe water source for the people living in the Lagmore, Poleglass and north Lisburn areas? Finally, as regards funding for the Water Service, what measures, in relation to the Executive, has the Minister taken to rectify this historic underfunding so that the people of Northern Ireland will have an up-to-date water service adequate to meet their needs?</p>

<p>There was a range of questions, and I will endeavor to deal with each of them. Mr&nbsp;Maginness, the Chairman of the Committee for Regional Development, offered his sympathy to the people affected. I have already done that, and I repeat my sympathies to them.</p>
<p>The first question referred to satisfaction with the way officials acted and the speed with which they acted. Given the complex nature of this problem and the length of time it took to establish that there was a possibility that the public water supply was the cause of the problem, my officials acted very speedily. As I said in my statement, it was on 31 August that the outbreak control team directed that a &quot;boiled water&quot; notice should be issued, and within hours of that notice being issued copies were was being hand delivered to 17,500 homes.</p>
<p>The other issue concerns how I and my Department are dealing with funding to ensure that we have a sufficient water supply that can deal with the problems that Northern Ireland is faced with in the twenty-first century. I referred to that towards the conclusion of my statement, and the bids that we have made, and are making, will reflect that. We hope that we can address those problems.</p>

<p>From what we know about the source, a developer, or someone, breached the outer skin of a Victorian pipe carrying this water and removed bricks to provide a better angle for an outflow from a sewerage system. I understand that the pipe is marked with ventilation shafts, so there is a degree of surface visibility.</p>
<p>The question is whether the developer was aware of what he had come across and what he was digging into. Or did he know what he was doing and proceed anyway?</p>
<p>Should there be a better system for marking the pipeline by including some sort of warning notice? Given the likely end cost of this in human terms, in medical terms &mdash; and I am talking about the cost of hospital services &mdash; and in terms of Water Service costs, can the Minister give any indication of how much this will cost and whether anyone will be held accountable?</p>

<p>Mr McFarland&rsquo;s question is a difficult one, in that there are many legal issues involved, particularly in relation to the developer to whom he referred. The Water Service is anxious that no inference should be drawn as to any individual and that no household or dwelling should be identified as being in some way responsible for the problem. There is no evidence that this was anything other than an accidental ingress.</p>
<p>The hon Member also talked about identifying the route of the conduit. For precisely those reasons &mdash; and clearly I will have to go into this in some detail with my officials &mdash; I believe that the Water Service would not be of a mind to do that. It could add to the possibility, for example, of some type of terrorist attack or some type of deliberate, malicious or malevolent intent to interfere with the public water supply. While I understand the rationale behind the hon Member&rsquo;s thinking, I hope that he will understand the complex issues surrounding this matter. My officials are looking at ways and means of ensuring that nothing like this ever happens again.</p>

<p>As a public representative for the Lagan Valley and Lisburn Borough Council areas, where most of the contamination occurred, I have had to deal with angry constituents &mdash; elderly people as well as those with young children &mdash; who have been infected by cryptosporidium. The extent of the community&rsquo;s anger at the fact that their water system could be contaminated in this way should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>The Minister has now given us the relevant facts, and it appears that this problem was imposed on the Water Service in that it was caused by an ingress into its water system by an outside party. What parts have the building control division of Lisburn Borough Council and the Department of the Environment Planning Service played in relation to this problem? Also, is there any connection between this outbreak and the cryptosporidium outbreak in May, which came about as a result of contamination by sheep in the Silent Valley?</p>

<p>I am conscious of the nature of Mr Poots&rsquo;s concern and want to assure him and his constituents that at the conclusion of this major incident my officials, in conjunction with health officials and, where relevant, Department of the Environment officials, will be looking at all aspects of it to see what changes, if any, can be introduced to prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Let me give some idea of the scale of this problem.</p>
<p>At the time of identifying the Lagmore conduit, my officials initially walked the entire line of the seven-mile conduit, examining the air wells along it and taking bacteriological samples. They identified samples where there was bacteriological contamination and used this information to identify a specific stretch of conduit, which was then examined by closed-circuit television. There followed a series of consequential actions.</p>
<p>At the close of this outbreak, my Department will liaise with every departmental official necessary to try to ensure that this does not recur. If there is a possibility that public health officials at Lisburn Borough Council could be of assistance, they will liaise directly with them.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat. Like other Members, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the chance to put one or two questions to him. Is it not true that, but for the diligence of a local GP and the actions of the consultant for communicable disease control, the outbreak of cryptosporidium would not have been discovered, given that, as late as 25 August, the Water Service still refused to accept that it was at fault? Can the Minister outline what steps will be taken to ensure the future monitoring of the water supply, since, according to a number of reports he mentioned, Lagmore was at lower risk than Silent Valley, in spite of the fact that there were outbreaks in both? The Minister assures Members of the seriousness with which he takes this issue. However, comments in the weekend press belie this. I ask the Minister to reassure my constituents, as he did those of Mr Poots, by confirming that he will meet with Sinn Féin representatives from that area to discuss this issue.</p>

<p>I should like to outline once more the response in the specific time period referred to. In the week beginning 21 August the Eastern Health and Social Services Board became aware of a number of cases of cryptosporidiosis in the Poleglass area. On 25 August there were more than 20 confirmed cases, and at that stage an outbreak control team had been established. That control team is chaired by the consultant for communicable disease control, which is not the responsibility of my Department.</p>
<p>Conducting an investigation into the outbreak is the responsibility of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board. My role and that of the Water Service is to assist the outbreak control team in every possible way. It was only on 31 August that a &quot;boil water&quot; notice was issued on the direction of the outbreak control team. On that day my officials were hand delivering the request to 17,500 homes. I hope that gives some indication of the sequence of events and the speed with which the officials dealt with the matter.</p>
<p>Last week, on an approach from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, I requested that my senior Water Service official, Mr Robert Martin, go to the Executive Committee to give a comprehensive briefing on this issue. The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister must have been aware that my election manifesto commitment meant that I would not be at that meeting myself. It is impossible for them to have been unaware that that was the case.</p>
<p>I am prepared to come before the House to make statements and answer questions. In addition, I have offered myself to the Regional Development Committee for further presentations, as the situation develops, and to respond to further questions. In the minds of most people I am offering full, frank and co-operative consultation with all Members of this House. However, I will not respond to or engage in party politicking on this issue.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement, particularly the penultimate paragraph. The name of the bug may be cryptosporidium, but the cause of this parasite getting into our water supply can only be put down to a mixture of carelessness, negligence and complacency on the part of the Department. I welcome the fact that the Minister has recognised that, to a degree, in his penultimate paragraph, where he refers to the underfunding of the Department over the past 20 years and the fact that the infrastructure is out of date. Only a complacent, careless or negligent Department would permit a 110-year-old conduit to continue to exist.</p>
<p>Under the Water and Sewerage Services (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1993, there is a duty on the Department to supply water that is wholesome at the time of supply and also to keep itself informed about the wholesomeness of the water supply. At this juncture the Department has failed in that respect.</p>
<p>As one who lives in the area I am expressing the view of a number of people who are extremely concerned. They are concerned at the length of time &mdash;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Will you instruct the speaker to ask his question and stop making a statement?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.6.25" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90090" speakername="Ms Jane Morrice" time="13:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#6">
<p>I ask the speaker to question the Minister. That is the purpose of the statement.</p>

<p>I will pass those comments to the Speaker on the appropriate occasion.</p>
<p>The questions I have put &mdash; and I will re-emphasise them &mdash; are to seek an assurance from the Minister that the Department has failed and was negligent or complacent in the fulfilment of its duty under the Water and Sewerage Services (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1993 by not supplying a wholesome supply of water to my constituents.</p>
<p>The other point on which I want to seek assurance from the Minister is that there was a degree of what verged on a cover-up in the length of time it took for information to be passed to our constituents. It has been known since early this year that there was a potential problem. Sheep and the poor farmer, rather than the bug, were being blamed.</p>

<p>I do not understand the gist of the question. Please get to the point of the question you are putting to the Minister.</p>

<p>To be direct, why were people who became ill with the bug cryptosporidium directed to take a water-only diet when it was the very water that was causing their illness? Patients in a particular home became very seriously ill as a result. I put it to the Minister that if the information had been presented earlier the outbreak would have been prevented.</p>
<p>Finally, does the Minister agree that the extra expense incurred by my constituents in Lagan Valley through having to boil water, or acquire bottled water &mdash; and where the amount of bottled water being consumed is 180&nbsp;times the normal amount &mdash; should be rebated through the rates? Does the Minister agree that water and sewerage account for approximately 30% of the regional rate and that as the regional rate constitutes two thirds of the overall rate, there is a perfectly logical argument that my constituents should receive a rebate?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.6.29" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90020" speakername="Mr Gregory Campbell" time="13:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#6">
<p>I refute the accusations of carelessness and negligence. There was a wholesome supply of water. The problem in relation to Lagmore conduit was as I have outlined. My officials have done everything possible; they continue to do everything possible; and they will in the future do everything possible to ensure that there is wholesome drinking water for the public.</p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;Close referred to the rates element. Any rate rebate &mdash; and I have seen that referred to previously in the public domain &mdash; is not a matter for the Department for Regional Development. Rating issues are the direct responsibility of the Department of Finance and Personnel and, therefore, ought to be directed to them.</p>
<p>The problems faced by Mr Close&rsquo;s constituents in the Lisburn area are ones that all of us identify with. The issue has to be speedily resolved, and we are currently doing that. Later this week, I hope to be in a position to announce the tie-up of the new connection to the Lagmore conduit to ensure that the bug is eradicated from the system. The new conduit, which is currently being laid, will be linked up within the affected area to ensure that wholesome supply of public water in the Lisburn area.</p>

<p>I welcome the good work done by the Department in getting to the source as quickly as it did. However, I have immediate and local concerns about the latter part of the Minister&rsquo;s statement concerning a ban on grazing in the Silent Valley catchment area.</p>
<p>Can he tell the House what is the acceptable level of cryptosporidium in the water supply? Will he specifically tell us how many instances there were in the survey &mdash; and in the ongoing surveys &mdash; where the level was exceeded in the Silent Valley catchment area? Can he also tell us by how much the level was exceeded? Will he tell us whether those samples &mdash; and I am talking about the Silent Valley again, not the most recent outbreak that my Colleague asked about &mdash; contained infection from a human or an animal source?</p>
<p>Will he also tell us whether these samples identified &mdash; and I refer here to the Silent Valley &mdash; contain infection from a human or an animal source, and if the actual source of this contamination can be identified? Will he also tell us why, since he has decided to ban grazing in this area, he and his Department are not prepared to pay compensation to those farmers who are already in straitened circumstances &mdash; perilous as Dr Paisley described it earlier &mdash; because of the state of the industry and who will, as a result, lose their winter fodder through no fault of their own? Did he consult with the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development on the impact of such a decision and on the implications of the timing of the decision on the farming community in the Mournes?</p>
<p>Finally, why will he not do the responsible thing and sit down with his Executive Colleagues in health and agriculture and work out a sensible solution to all of the aspects of this crisis and not give the impression that this decision was nothing more than a political decoy, taken to save the DUP&rsquo;s face and shift the blame to someone else in order to cover up the incompetence of the policy of rotating ministerial posts?</p>

<p>There are a number of issues here with which I will attempt to deal.</p>
<p>With regard to compensation to the farmers in the Mournes, the legal advice to the Department is very clear. Grazing rights on these lands, which are owned by the Department for Regional Development, have traditionally been reviewed on an annual basis. The contract confers rights to grazing only and not possession of the grazing land itself. The legal advice is that we can discontinue the practice of granting grazing rights, regardless of how many years this practice has been in existence. I know and fully understand that this will come as a great disappointment to the farmers, but I must have regard for the legal position.</p>
<p>I have asked my officials &mdash; and I hope this will answer the other question about agriculture and rural development liaison &mdash; to continue their liaison with Department of Agriculture and Rural Development officials to establish what measures, if any, can be taken to assist those farmers affected.</p>
<p>Mr ONeill also asked about the acceptable levels of cryptosporidium in the water. I will provide him with written specific details of the acceptable level, the level beyond which a &quot;boil water&quot; notice is issued. However, may I say to him that if there had been a breach of that level, which is accepted throughout the United Kingdom and is enforced in Northern Ireland, in the Silent Valley, a &quot;boil water&quot; notice would have been issued. It would not have been the responsibility of my Department to issue such a notice, as I have made clear in my response to previous questions.</p>
<p>I am disappointed with the Member&rsquo;s last question. I have endeavoured at all times through these problems and dilemmas &mdash; as I have with others &mdash; to deal with the subject matter efficiently and as effectively and impartially as possible. I have not and will not take party political advantage over such an issue as this. In this respect I find the question &mdash;</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Minister for his statement and also for his reply to me last week. I may be breaking into the ambit of the Health Minister, but perhaps Members will bear with me.</p>
<p>In relation to the timing of the outbreak, it has been brought to my attention that on 25&nbsp;August the public water supply was highly suspect, but the Water Service refused to acknowledge this. One of the doctors told the Health Minister when she visited Dunmurry last week that it would be foolish to underestimate the seriousness of the outbreak. However, only a few months before this a spokesman for the Eastern Health Board said that there was no reason to be unduly worried. Can the Minister confirm that there were sheep or cattle in the Silent&nbsp;Valley reservoir in May? Can he tell us &mdash; or find out &mdash; whether, in the various strains of this bug where people have been confirmed as infected, slurry has been confirmed as the problem? This has been identified as the cause in one case in Lisburn. Finally, does the Minister agree that it is extremely important to review the procedure so that information can be circulated to the general public more quickly?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.6.36" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90020" speakername="Mr Gregory Campbell" time="13:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#6">
<p>Mr Davis has raised a number of issues. In relation to timing &mdash; and I thank him for that information, which we will follow up &mdash; the clear indication was, as I mentioned in my statement, that a risk assessment was done for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s water supply. The conduit, within which a breach has occurred, was not identified as high risk. I am satisfied that the risk assessment, which was undertaken by the Water Service, has been diligently carried out in accordance with the national standards. However, it would help to improve public confidence in the water supply if there were an independent review of these risk assessments. One possible approach might be a review undertaken by the Northern Ireland drinking water inspector. I have briefly mentioned this to the Minister of the Environment but need to speak to him further on this issue. The public can be reassured that every possible step will be taken to protect the public water supply.</p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;Davis referred to the possibility of sheep in the reservoir. Since the notice was issued to remove sheep from the lands surrounding the reservoir a small number of sheep have re-entered the reservoir. Steps have been taken to have them removed. I am not aware of any further information in addition to that. I have no information regarding the slurry. My officials will pursue this and will respond in writing to Mr&nbsp;Davis.</p>

<p>I congratulate the officials at the Department for Regional Development, and those working in and under the authority of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, for their response to this crisis. The Minister will want to take make it clear publicly how scandalous, inane and scurrilous the comments by the deputy leader of the Alliance Party and by the Member for South Down from the SDLP were.

<p>On a further point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Is it not common practice that the debate and questions last for an hour after the Minister has finished making a statement? The Minister finished at one o&rsquo;clock. You declared that this debate would finish at quarter to two, and I notice also that the clock has not been set for the one-hour period.</p>

<p>Thank you for that point of order. It was agreed by the Business Committee that there would be one hour for this debate. I am just checking Standing Orders to see if it is one hour following the ministerial statement. It is up to the Speaker to determine. The Business Committee has said one hour. That said, while we may try and go a little over the time allocated, I would prefer it if everyone could be succinct.</p>

<p>I can assure you that I will not take longer than Mr Close did to ask his question.</p>
<p>Does the Minister agree that it was scurrilous to suggest that he, his officials or the Water Service were responsible for a third party reaching the water system? Is Mr Close suggesting that there should be some monitoring so that the moment a cryptosporidium enters the water system, the Water Service should be aware of it? To help Members understand how absurd that suggestion is, perhaps the Minister will confirm that a cryptosporidium oocysts is one two-hundredth of a millimetre long. The length of water pipes and conduits in Northern Ireland is about 15,000 miles &mdash; more than the distance from here to Australia. It is just conceivable that an oocysts could enter the water supply via a third party. Should the criticism not therefore be of the contractor, or of the Planning Service for allowing it to happen, or of building control for not supervising it properly, instead of attempting to blame those hard-working officials in the Department for Regional Development?</p>
<p>Does the Minister recognise that the crisis that we have seen over the last number of days is such that the people in Northern Ireland will want from him a clear indication that we can have full confidence in the public water supply? Will he ensure that proper steps are taken to change the enquiry forms that are sent to the various Departments and agencies by Planning Service so that this kind of issue is taken into account? Planning decisions should be taken so as to ensure that no houses are built close to or beside the main water supply, especially if they have septic tanks.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity to refute again the terms used by Mr Close. The terms &quot;carelessness&quot; and &quot;negligence&quot; were totally inappropriate. The only issue on which I concur with the Member &mdash; and I expect and hope for his support &mdash; is the continuous underfunding of the system for almost 30 years. If there is a semblance of an issue arising from Mr Close&rsquo;s question with which I concur, it is that.</p>
<p>I thank Mr P Robinson and agree with him. It may be possible to address planning issues. I will consult with the Department of the Environment, and my officials will look at any possible measures that would preclude this from occurring again in close proximity to a dwelling.</p>

<p>It will be one, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
<p>The expert group on cryptosporidium appointed by the Government made a further report in 1998 with 50&nbsp;revised recommendations. Has the Water Service adopted and implemented those 50 revised recommendations?</p>
<p>The other point of clarification concerns the test evidence. On 25 August the Water Service was reluctant to accept that the public water supply was the cause of the outbreak of cryptosporidosis because there was no test evidence available. Can the Minister say if the results of the samples taken on 22 August were not available? Did the present test procedure fail, or was there no evidence of cryptosporidium in the samples? In the case of the latter, is the Minister satisfied that the present test procedure is adequate if it failed to detect cryptosporidium in the samples that subsequently proved to be infected?</p>

<p>I will deal with the issue of the recommendations arising from the original report. All 51&nbsp;recommendations have been adopted, and implementation is ongoing.</p>
<p>I will return to the dates lest there be any doubt regarding the sequence of events. On 21&nbsp;August &mdash; and only on 21&nbsp;August &mdash; the Eastern Health Board became aware of a number of cases of cryptosporidiosis in the Poleglass area. There was no indication on 21&nbsp;August that that could be traceable to the public water supply. By 25&nbsp;August there were 20 confirmed cases, and an outbreak control team had been established.</p>
<p>Continuous sampling took place between 25 August and 29&nbsp;August, and on the evening of 30&nbsp;August the control team agreed to issue a &quot;boil water&quot; notice. That was issued on the morning of 31 August, by which time my officials were in the process of hand delivering 17,500 &quot;boil water&quot; notices. I hope that clarifies the speed, nature and chronological sequence of events that took place from 21 August to 31&nbsp;August.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement, and we join in his praise for the Department for Regional Development officials on their actions, given the logistics that they presently operate under. However, I trust that a review of this particular incident will lead to more efficient methods of dealing with incidents of this nature in the future.</p>
<p>In his presentation, the Minister stated that 22 sources have been identified as having lower risk factors. Indeed, the incident occurred on one of these sources as a result, admittedly, of an external incursion into the system.</p>
<p>Will the Minister undertake to identify the other 21&nbsp;sources and give the House an assurance that there will be an upgrading of risk assessment methodology? I would not expect that to be done today, but perhaps in writing at some later stage to the House.</p>

<p>I thank the Member for the succinct nature of his question; I will endeavour to be equally as succinct.</p>
<p>I want &mdash; and I am sure the Member will agree &mdash; to ensure that nothing is said that will lead to an increase in fear and suspicion among the public regarding the public water supply. While I take his point that the ingress occurred on one of the 22 sources identified as being lower risk, I would not want to publicly identify the other 21. I will undertake to write to the hon Member indicating measures that we can take in relation to the assessment of risk once this issue has been dealt with and is over.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his frank and honest statement. I too join in the thanks to Mr&nbsp;Martin and his colleagues for their very swift and professional reaction to the present outbreak.

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. As the Silent Valley has been identified as the source with the highest risk of contamination, does the Minister agree that the 2003 timescale is totally inadequate? It is putting at risk the health of 250,000 people as well as placing a financial burden on sheep farmers. Does the Minister agree that, while an investment of £32 million to replace the conduit is welcome, to wait until 2003 for completion will put a terrible strain on the 250,000 people who expect to receive pure water? Given that funding should take priority over other matters, does the Minister agree that in the interim, compensation should be given to farmers? There is talk of farmers receiving some compensation for this year, but there is no mention of 2002 and 2003.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy, I asked that Members put only one question.</p>

<p>It is very unfair. Like everyone else, I am entitled to ask this question, and I want it answered.</p>
<p>With regard to the outbreak in the Lisburn and Poleglass areas, what financial assistance will be given to those who have suffered from the financial strain, especially those in receipt of benefits who have had to buy bottled water, incurred higher electricity bills, and so on?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.6.57" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90020" speakername="Mr Gregory Campbell" time="13:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#6">
<p>With regard to compensation I have already said that legal advice is of a particular nature and therefore precludes me from making any assurance on those grounds.</p>
<p>With regard to the Silent Valley, there is a proven risk of contamination to the public water supply from livestock grazing in reservoir catchment areas. There was an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the Manchester area last year, and it was linked to sheep grazing around a reservoir.</p>
<p>The risk assessments carried out on the Water Service reservoirs have shown that the Silent&nbsp;Valley is particularly at risk due to the lack of a satisfactory level of treatment. The system to provide that level of treatment is in place, but it cannot be completed before the 2003 financial year. That is why sheep have been excluded from the area surrounding the Silent&nbsp;Valley. Any other measures taken by the Water Service to protect the wholesome water supply derived from there will be taken. However, a more categoric assurance can be given with regard to the completion of the treatment works in the reservoir area. They cannot be completed until the 2003 financial year.</p>

<p>My Colleague Mr ONeill adequately covered most of the problems pertaining to South Down. According to my notes he asked eight questions, but I picked up on only two answers. I will have to wait until I receive Hansard tomorrow to see all the answers.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that the Minister did not attend the Executive meeting on this specific issue. I am disappointed that he put party before people. It was his one chance to meet with the Executive and not have to make any excuses for doing so.</p>
<p>My question refers to compensation. Some farmers have to sell stock due to the lack and loss of grazing. When the funds from such sales are put into the bank they are not put into deposit accounts &mdash; the bank will keep the money. Meanwhile, three or four years of inflation will occur. Will the Minister introduce a subsidy scheme, or some form of financial assistance, to help farmers restock in three or four years time, bearing inflation in mind? The money farmers would receive by selling stock now will not be enough to purchase stock in three or four years&rsquo; time. Will the Minister put in place a scheme that would adequately fund a restocking scheme in three or four years&rsquo; time? Let us be hopeful that the farmer will get back to grazing the land.</p>

<p>I am sure Mr Bradley will appreciate that his latter point would be more appropriately made to his Colleague the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. I await that Department&rsquo;s response to those comments. The Member would not expect me to comment on them.</p>
<p>Mr Bradley raised the issue of my non-attendance at the Executive Committee. This matter required immediate action &mdash; not prolonged discussion &mdash; and that is what I undertook.</p>

<p>Are there other similarly constructed water conduits in Northern Ireland, and can the Minister assure the House that, as a result of lessons learnt from the outbreaks of cryptosporidium in Lisburn and Poleglass, this type of outbreak will not happen elsewhere in the Province?</p>

<p>The problem in relation to Lagmore was not in the intrinsic nature of the conduit. There was a third-party breach of the conduit. It was therefore a difficulty caused more by others than by the fact that the conduit was 110 years old. Up until this ingress there had not been incidents of this nature.</p>

<p>With permission, A LeasCheann Comhairle, I will make a statement about the second sectoral meeting on education of the North/South Ministerial Council held in the Manor House at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Cultra, on Monday 3 July.</p>
<p>Following nomination by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey and I attended the sectoral meeting of the Council. The Irish Government was represented by Dr&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Woods TD, Minister for Education and Science. This statement has been approved by Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey and is also made on his behalf.</p>
<p>The main objective of the meeting was to review the progress made by the working groups which we agreed to establish at the first meeting on 3&nbsp;February in relation to educational underachievement, special education needs and teacher qualifications. These working groups will bring forward to the next council meeting in the autumn proposals on the priorities which they have identified, delivery measures which might be adopted and suggested timescales for addressing the range of issues involved.</p>
<p>We also noted that a contract had been agreed by my Department and the Department of Education and Science in Dublin with the Centre for Cross Border Studies in Armagh for the conduct of an evaluation of the range and effectiveness of current initiatives on school, teacher and youth exchanges. The study will also make recommendations to a steering committee, representative of both Administrations, on the possibilities for a coherent, integrated strategy for the future. The study is scheduled to be completed by 31&nbsp;October this year.</p>
<p>The council also noted a range of recent co-operative ventures in the field of education since its last meeting. These included the very successful Doors project, which was a celebration of lifelong learning through performances involving over 1,700 young people at four locations on the island &mdash; Cork, Dublin, Belfast and Derry City &mdash; and the conference, Education &mdash; the Challenges to 2020, which was held at Stranmillis University College on 30&nbsp;May. This was a very significant conference, which was attended by Minister&nbsp;Woods, Minister&nbsp;Farren, the United States Secretary for Education, Richard Riley, and myself.</p>
<p>Finally, against the background of EU programmes, the council noted with satisfaction the significant co-operation between the two Administrations in the past and the opportunities for further collaboration under the new round of EU programmes, particularly through the Peace II operational programme. The council agreed a range of priority areas in both education and the youth sector that might be supported through that programme.</p>
<p>In addition, the council noted that 2001 has been designated as the European year of languages and agreed that a joint conference would be organised to address issues of common interest in the area of language learning. The next meeting of the council is planned for 24&nbsp;November in the South.</p>
<p>The council agreed that text of a communiqué which was issued following the meeting. A copy of the communiqué has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

<p> I am grateful for the opportunity to ask some questions. The Minister has sold the virtues, whatever they be, of North/South co-operation, yet he steadfastly refuses to co-operate in the investigation of the Omagh bombing and the apprehension of those responsible for it, in spite of knowledge undoubtedly in his possession. He would therefore have to accept that his efforts in North/South co-operation are meaningless.</p>
<p>When does the Minister intend to inform the Assembly Education Committee about the detail of the issues raised at the second sectoral meeting on education, particularly given our stated interest in underachievement?</p>
<p>What, if any, progress has been made by the steering groups? I find that both the statement made today and the communiqué lodged in the Assembly Library are very short in detail in all those matters. The remarks I made at the outset are crucial.</p>

<p>Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle, for pointing out that the first issue raised is not within the purview of the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
<p>There have been a number of briefing sessions between my officials and the Education Committee to inform the Committee about these matters. My officials are quite within their rights to inform the Education Committee of the details of the conduct of the North/South Ministerial Council meetings. If there is dissatisfaction about that level of contact, obviously it is my responsibility to investigate with my officials whether or not questions that have been asked about the conduct of the North/South Ministerial Council meetings have been adequately answered. I will ensure that they are, because I am very much in favour of a good working relationship between the Department and the Education Committee. I will endeavour to ensure that whatever information is required is made available at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>Quite a number of the working parties have been established. They are made up of civil servants from our Department and from the Department of Education and Science in Dublin. The information regarding that will be made available to the Committee at the earliest opportunity. I do not have the names before me, but I will endeavour to ensure that the names of all the civil servants, North and South, who make up the joint working groups will be sent to the Committee as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>It is also important to point out that all the papers from the North/South Ministerial Council meetings on education went to the Executive, including the terms of reference of the steering groups, before the North/South Ministerial Council meeting. It is not a huge issue for me. People are entitled to information. I will ensure that the fullest information about the composition of these bodies is sent to the Committee.</p>
<p>As for the issue of special educational needs, this is a very important area of our work. My Department believes it is absolutely vital that we deal with the issue of educational underachievement. That is going to be a huge issue for us. The issues of attendance, literacy and numeracy, and child protection are also vital. They are key areas for us, and we are endeavouring to push forward work in all of them as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>Regarding EU support, everyone will be aware that funding will be available under Peace II.</p>
<p>At this stage it is difficult to be precise. Officials have only recently received the European Commission&rsquo;s comments on the draft programme which was submitted earlier this year. These comments will be negotiated with the commission over the next few weeks. Once these are concluded and a programme is agreed, applications for funding will be invited. I would expect that funds will not begin to flow until early next year.</p>
<p>The new peace programme will be the last time that we have a special funding package from the EU. The programme will operate North and South. We have to use the funds available to the best advantage of our young people. That is for sure. We are particularly keen to support initiatives that address educational disadvantage and promote social inclusion. Measures which help and encourage young people to remain in education and improve basic skills which will help them gain employment will be particularly important.</p>

<p>I am delighted to see that 2001 has been designated the European year of languages. Will the Minister seek to appoint more Irish-language teachers and special language counsellors to assist young people seeking to learn Irish, and provide facilities and other supports to make Irish an attractive choice for students?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90081" speakername="Mr Martin McGuinness" time="13:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>The European year of languages is an opportunity to actively promote the learning of other languages. There will be a range of activities taking place in each country and collaboration between countries. This presents a special opportunity for all of us on this island to celebrate the diversity of languages in Europe and to encourage the learning and use of other languages.</p>
<p>The themes for the conferences have not yet been developed, but I hope to give the Assembly some information after the next sectoral meeting. The European year of languages is intended to celebrate the diversity of languages in Europe and to encourage the learning of other languages. I encourage all young people to try to gain some knowledge and appreciation of other languages. I appreciate the importance of ensuring that there are enough fully qualified Irish-language teachers. That is vitally important.</p>
<p>The establishment over the summer of Comhairle na Réamhscolaíochta, which has now met as a fully-fledged educational body, will make a huge contribution to the development of the Irish language on the island of Ireland. It will give us all an opportunity to fulfil our very clear responsibilities to parents, pupils and educationalists who are responsible for teaching through the medium of Irish. In many parts of the island of Ireland, and specifically within the part of Ireland that is under our control, it is obvious that many communities are rediscovering the language. They value its importance in terms of culture and heritage. It is not confined to Nationalist and Republican areas. There is very broad appreciation in the Unionist community that this is something which enriches all of us. That is something that can be a tremendous unifying force if it is managed and conducted properly.</p>

<p>I note that the statement starts with the Minister declaring that he is speaking on behalf of Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey. Is the Northern Ireland Executive now such a cosy arrangement that IRA/Sinn Féin can speak for the Ulster Unionist Party, or is this yet another example of the Minister stepping outside his responsibility and exceeding his authority?</p>
<p>There is a plethora of meetings, groups, contracts, conferences in this statement: sectoral meetings, working groups, contracts with other bodies to carry out studies, conferences on this, and conferences on that. All of this is work which could be done within Northern Ireland itself. What is the approximate cost of all this &quot;North/Southery&quot;? We seem to get the same kind of reports on every occasion, so what has actually come out of it?</p>
<p>Lastly, I notice that there is to be a conference on language learning. Will there be a session on doublespeak? On one hand, the Minister supports the Peace II programme, while, as Danny&nbsp;Kennedy has pointed out, he refuses to say &mdash; in fact, he defiantly proclaims he would not say &mdash; if he knows who was responsible for the Omagh bomb. Will the Minister<i> </i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir&nbsp;Reg Empey agreed the content of the statement that I have made for both of us. If people listen to the contributions of other Ministers, it will become clear that representatives of the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and Sinn Féin who make up the ministerial team at Executive meetings are working well together. They are very conscious of their responsibilities to the people, and work in such a fashion as can contribute greatly to the gaining of confidence. We can overcome our problems and our difficulties.</p>
<p>Regarding how much this has cost and who is going to pay for it, the areas that we have identified are areas that we would all be working on anyway, both North and South. We are enhancing that by sharing good practice and developing common approaches and common answers to shared problems. To that extent, we expect the work at this stage to be very largely cost- neutral. There may be some limited extra expenditure incurred on travel, and perhaps materials, but this will be found from within existing departmental budgets. Obviously there may be cost implications arising from proposals from the working groups, and I will consider these at the appropriate time. Should there be a conference on doublespeak, we will invite the Member to be there.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an tuairisc seo. Is í an cheist atá agam ná: ar stad obair na Comhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas ar an oideachas le linn do na hinstitiúidí polaitiúla bheith ar ceal?</p>
<p>I welcome this report. I welcome continuing close contacts between the Minister and the Education Committee, of which I am happy to say I was a member. Did the period of suspension of the political institutions disrupt the work of the North/South Ministerial Council with respect to education? Did it prevent or stall the very valuable work in the field of educational progress being carried out by the North/South Ministerial Council?</p>

<p>The suspension certainly did not stop it, but it did delay it. There is no question about that. Without ministerial direction, there was never going to be the essential progress that needed to be made. Since the institutions have been re-established and the Ministers are back working again, it is clear from the last North/South Ministerial Council meeting that civil servants in the Department of Education and Science and ourselves here in the North are working speedily to make up the ground which was lost. I am confident that we will do that, that we will do it this year and that we can all move on happily to put in place the processes which we know are required to improve the educational standards of all the children on this island.</p>

<p>In his statement, the Minister mentioned both teaching qualifications and teacher exchanges between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. What progress has been made in facilitating the movement of qualified teachers from Northern Ireland to work in the Republic of Ireland? Hitherto there have been a number of obstacles or barriers to such movement of labour &mdash; notably the Irish language requirement, even in cases where the main occupation of the teacher is not actually teaching Irish itself, be it at the primary or secondary level.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90081" speakername="Mr Martin McGuinness" time="14:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>We have already gone a long way towards mutual recognition of qualifications, in line with European Union directives. The South already accepts graduates from certain teacher training courses, and we are looking at the practicalities of extending that. The key issue concerns an assurance about the quality of training provided and the confidence of teachers to teach in our schools.</p>
<p>On the issue of the Irish language, we have set up the working group without prejudice as to what recommendations may emerge. The South has already gone a considerable way towards relaxing the Irish language requirement, and it will undoubtedly feature in future discussions.</p>

<p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the working groups set up. I would particularly like to touch on special education needs. Will the Minister ensure that when that group is prioritising it will consider making sure that children with disabilities are given an automatic right to enter mainstream education and that appropriate funding is put in place?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.17" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90081" speakername="Mr Martin McGuinness" time="14:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>We will certainly make that a priority. In our discussions with officials from the South it has been appreciated that this is a vitally important area. As head of the Department of Education, following a number of recent visits to special education schools, I have indicated to officials that I want this to be regarded as a priority. Many years ago special education establishments were effectively old hospitals under the remit of the Department of Health. They were then transferred to the Department of Education. Those are the ones I am particularly concerned about. Through visiting them it is clear that the conditions under which pupils, parents and teachers have to operate are far from satisfactory. It is a huge issue, and I will be paying particular attention to it in future.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.18" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90048" speakername="Mr Oliver Gibson" time="14:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>The Minister mentions a number of areas of concern &mdash; educational underachievement, special education and teacher qualifications. Which university or college in the South is dealing with underachievement? How are the issues apportioned? Who is funding the investigations, and when can we expect a report on the areas of concern? Can the Minister explain what is meant by &quot;coherent, integrated strategy for the future&quot;? Is it the harmonisation of programmes North and South? Is it upward or downward harmonisation? What will it mean for educational standards in Northern Ireland?</p>
<p>Having looked at those priorities in his statement he then talks about another range of priorities under Peace II. Is the money that is coming from Europe under Peace II additional to the educational budget? Can he assure us that that money will not be funding something that would already be part of our educational system?</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;range of priorities&quot; is bland. Having listed the medium priorities that are already under investigation, is anyone in the working group asking about solutions which might already exist in Europe or America, or in some of the Third-World countries where great strides are being made in education? In other words, could we end up spending Peace II money simply to spend money rather than ensure educational advancement?</p>
<p>My last question also concerns co-operation. Why does the South of Ireland refuse to pay the pension of a teacher or a lecturer in the North of Ireland? This has been much lobbied about by those who have spent part of a lifetime in the South of Ireland and wish to retire, particularly in the border areas. They may want to enjoy a higher standard of living, but they certainly cannot get paid from the South. That sort of co-operation happens freely elsewhere in Europe. I wonder why the South of Ireland is lagging so far behind.</p>

<p>There are a number of questions there, and if I miss any of them I will gladly give the Member a written answer.</p>
<p>I have made it very clear that the working groups that we have established will be presenting interim reports for the next North/South Ministerial Council. Harmonisation is not an issue. We are learning from each other. We are sharing best practice. The education system&rsquo;s curriculum and exams are very different, as Members know, but obviously we are trying to bring about a situation where we learn effectively from each other. Our remit is very carefully laid down, and nobody can be under any illusions about hidden agendas or anything else. At the same time, however, we think it important to state that we do appreciate that as we develop our relationships on the island we must, to enable us to provide the best possible education for all of the children who live on this island, be open to ideas and suggestions.</p>
<p>If people come forward with innovative schemes, the sensible thing to do is to have all of that out in the open, and that is what the Assembly is for. That is why I must come here and report back. I am not going to be part of anything which attempts by sleight of hand to make people like Oliver&nbsp;Gibson or anybody else nervous about the work that we are involved in, and for that reason we need to be very measured about how we move forward on the issue.</p>
<p>With regard to the Peace II money, all the funding is additional money, and priorities and negotiations with the EU Commission will finalise those details. The Assembly will be advised of them later.</p>
<p>The matter of teachers and the pension situation obviously is a difficulty at the moment. A teacher who moves to take up a job in either the North or the South cannot add his previous service to his new employment for the purposes of calculating pension benefits. This is an obstacle to mobility, and its removal would benefit all teachers, North and South. It is vital that we look at the concerns of teachers and that we try to facilitate them. Teachers in the South may also have problems and difficulties.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I congratulate the council and the Ministers on the very successful Doors project, a celebration of lifelong learning, involving young people in Ireland. There has been excellent feedback from all who participated in it. I ask the Minister what measures the North/South Council is undertaking to provide adequate child protection throughout the island of Ireland. Is this matter under consideration by any of the three working groups, or is it one of the priority areas in education and the youth sector?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.21" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90081" speakername="Mr Martin McGuinness" time="14:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>Last week I launched a CD-ROM at the Verbal Arts Centre in Derry.</p>
<p>That was a joint project between my Department and the Department of Education and Science in Dublin. It was hugely successful in bringing together storytellers from all over the island of Ireland. From this week, the CD-ROM is being issued to every school on the island. That is an example of the important and valuable work that can be done.</p>
<p>The remit of the joint working group on child protection is to look at how we can put in place the necessary mechanisms, both North and South, to enable us to identify people throughout these islands who are considered to be unsuitable to work with children &mdash; not just in education but in any setting, statutory or voluntary &mdash; and link those mechanisms in to similar ones in England, Wales and Scotland. In an age when the world is, in effect, getting smaller and there is much free travel in Europe, we cannot ignore the fact that we may need to extend those mechanisms on to the European mainland. We all know that there have been some disgraceful cases of child abuse in different European countries. People are travelling more than ever before, and we know that those who seek to take advantage of young children will go to any lengths. They do not necessarily reside in these islands, so it is important, in a European context, that we be prepared.</p>
<p>While it is education-led, this group also has representatives from the health sectors both North and South. The group has exchanged papers on current approaches to child protection and employment issues and is also examining the parameters of the task and the many sensitive and legal issues involved. The group has been briefed on the position in England, where much of the necessary underpinning legislation and procedures are already in place.</p>

<p>I congratulate the Minister on the Doors project, which was mentioned in his statement. I attended the concert in the Waterfront Hall, and it was a memorable evening. I hope that there will be further similar projects.</p>
<p>In an answer to the Chairman of the Education Committee, the Minister made some comments about his relationship with the Education Committee. I am sure that he wishes to have as good a working relationship as possible with that Committee. However, I was concerned by some of his other comments about the working groups on educational underachievement. When he says that these are serious issues from his point of view, I take it that he means from the Department&rsquo;s point of view. Is the Minister aware that the Education Committee&rsquo;s future programme of work will include those issues? Will he consider putting in place a better mechanism than the placing of his statements and the minutes in the library? Because of the work that we are undertaking, I ask him to consider putting a mechanism in place by which we would be informed directly of the work being done, and of progress, so that we are not dependent on the measures that he has already mentioned.</p>
<p>I am concerned that there would be serious overlap and duplication between the work carried out by these groups and by our Committee and that this would lead to a lack of credibility and results. I approve of the statement but hope that, rather than waiting for such a statement to be made, the Education Committee could have some sight of the work that is being done in order to avoid overlap.</p>

<p>I have listened carefully to what the Chairman of the Education Committee and Mrs Bell have said, and they have made an important point. I have no difficulty whatsoever about establishing a mechanism to ensure that the Committee is made aware of the outcome of these meetings before we issue what some would consider to be a bland statement about them.</p>

<p>I commend the Minister for taking forward the issue of child protection so urgently and so quickly. It was raised at the time of the last North/South Ministerial Council statement in the Assembly. Was new legislation required in the Republic of Ireland as it was in Northern Ireland? I note that legislation now has to come through our Committee for the exchange of details across jurisdictions. If something similar is required in the Oireachtas, implementation will obviously be a lengthy process.</p>
<p>I congratulate Assembly Member Eileen Bell, who attended the Doors project. &quot;Fantastic&quot; is the only word to describe it. Seventeen hundred young people from all corners of this island came together, and the logistics of bringing them together and enabling them to make the presentations they did were extraordinary. It was also fantastic for us to witness the integration of business and education in launching that initiative.</p>
<p>No doubt those young people learned a great deal from their involvement &mdash; and that leads me to my next question. For some time now I have been slightly sceptical about exchanges between Northern Ireland and the Republic. They may have been extremely useful in breaking down the demonisation, the stereotypical images and myths and, indeed, the fear of crossing the border, be it on the part of those in the Republic who had never visited Northern Ireland in their lives, or those from schools in Northern Ireland who felt that strange people lived on the other side. It would be useful to see a coherent, integrated strategy produced to test the effectiveness of those visits. I ask this question because of my own experience as a parent. I have been involved as a parent &mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.25" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90090" speakername="Ms Jane Morrice" time="14:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>The Member will move directly to the question she wishes to raise.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.26" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90086" speakername="Prof Monica McWilliams" time="14:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>The reason I ask this question is that, as a parent, I had it brought to my attention at a school meeting that schoolteachers were fearful of introducing state and maintained schools to each other before joint visits across the border under the education for mutual understanding programme. As a result, most education for mutual understanding visits were to Scotland and England.</p>
<p>I ask this question because even though we have a programme on education for mutual understanding, there is a great deal of fear about cross-border exchanges. Indeed, we have heard this from Members in this Chamber already &mdash; and particularly from a DUP Member, a former teacher, who probably would have nothing whatsoever to do with exchange visits if they involved his schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Although the Minister says that a range of priority areas have been agreed for education and the youth sector under the Peace II programme, I am concerned that we have absolutely no detail whatsoever on these priorities, and I would like to see them attached to future statements.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90081" speakername="Mr Martin McGuinness" time="14:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>There will very probably have to be legislation in Dublin. The second issue the Member raised is also important. In the course of my travels around different schools it has become clear that there is a tremendous willingness in both the state and maintained sectors to work together. I have seen an incredible number of joint projects taking place and have visited a number of schools in which teachers from both sectors are participating in prize-givings and education for mutual understanding. We are winning the battle in the North.</p>
<p>In the light of the work of Andy Pollak and his people at the Centre for Cross-Border Studies, it is important that people understand that for a number of years now, there has been a significant number of cross-border exchanges of teachers, pupils and young people.</p>
<p>We needed to get a better understanding of the range of exchanges involved and to evaluate their effectiveness. That is precisely what I think the Member is talking about. It is all very well improving the situation here in the North, but if we are not improving it to such an extent that people feel freed up to participate in these very important programmes, then we are going to have difficulties. Therefore evaluating the effectiveness of these at this time is vitally important. The research will look at issues such as the type of exchanges, their origins, their objectives, the management and financial arrangements and the curriculum areas involved. The research will also look at the scope for more effective management of exchanges to reduce duplication of effort and at how best practice might be mainstreamed and disseminated.</p>
<p>One key purpose of the research into exchanges is to look at the effectiveness of visits and to identify best practice in this area, not only for children, but also for teachers and the youth service, for which we have a responsibility.</p>
<p>With regard to the EU programmes, we are all very conscious that we must move forward in a sensible way. We want to encourage and support measures that are designed to help and support our most disadvantaged young people. It is very important that we build on the peace process and support projects that promote mutual understanding and reconciliation among young people.</p>
<p>The debate over the years has tended to focus and concentrate on relationships in the North, when we all know that relationships throughout the island are just as important, especially in an age when people are moving back and forward more freely, and there is a greater oneness.</p>
<p>The Good Friday Agreement clearly indicated that a huge number of people want to work to end divisions on the island. Those people have children who are at school, so they are very keen for the Assembly and the Executive to give leadership. One way is through the proper use of finances accruing from the EU peace programme and proper direction in putting in place best practice so that we can add value to the work already done. The sooner we do that the better. There are going to be difficulties and problems, such as have been referred to, but our job and responsibility is to move forward to try to resolve them as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>There is a huge responsibility for politicians from every party to give proper leadership at this time. We have come through a very difficult period recently. The situation on the Shankill Road was a tragedy and one we want to see resolved as a matter of urgency. When we get those difficulties out of the road we can then focus on politicians of all descriptions working in harmony. One example is Reg Empey&rsquo;s visit to the irish language body on the Falls Road. He deserves tremendous credit for that. Also, a delegation of people from this Assembly went to the United States in an effort to seek work for our young people. This clearly shows that we have the ability to overcome our problems and difficulties.</p>
<p>That is the big picture. My responsibility is education. All we can do is try to get that right. As we continue to work with our counterparts in the South, there is no doubt that we can overcome all the difficulties mentioned.</p>

<p>I am delighted that the council has noted that next year is the European Year of Languages. Does the Minister support the idea of a short, sharp survey in both parts of Ireland to establish the level of knowledge and interest in modern languages? Also, what can be done to ensure that all young people have the best possible opportunities to be multilingual in an ever more global environment?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.7.30" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90081" speakername="Mr Martin McGuinness" time="15:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#7">
<p>This is a hugely important area. It is vitally important that the European Year of Languages be intended to celebrate the diversity of languages in use in Europe and to encourage the learning of other languages. From our perspective in education, we believe it is vitally important that in a changing world, a world that is getting smaller for all of us, there are obvious economic prospects for our young people, not just those who work in Europe but in other parts of the world as well, and it is absolutely essential that people have other languages.</p>
<p>We are told that in a few years Chinese will be a huge Internet language, and it is extremely important that we give due consideration to that. I have no doubt that officials in my Department are very keen to establish how interested young people are in the learning of languages, and the information that we have makes it clear that a sizeable percentage of school-going pupils are interested in learning languages. I agree with the sentiment that the Member expressed. We will ensure that, at our end, at least, as we are working with officials from the Department of Education in the South, we will give due consideration to that in the future.</p>

<p>A LeasCheann Comhairle, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s work with the council on cross-border areas, in particular those of underachievement and child protection. I think there is a connection between those two issues. I would like to know if what they are working towards will achieve the objectives of life-long learning and youth issues in particular. One of the youth issues is that of life skills; the need for young people not only to achieve their educational needs but also to be able to deal with life issues when they leave education and face the wider world. That is a difficulty that I find people have now. Young people have great needs in that respect, and I wonder if the work that is being done will meet them.</p>
<p>When we have to face the educational challenges of the year 2020 in particular, we will find that these needs will become even more focused. Will the curriculum, on both sides of the border, be able to deal with whatever economic situation we will be facing in the years that lie ahead in terms of working towards an all-Ireland way of looking at things? I sometimes feel that the Celtic tiger has allowed people down South to become quite protective of what they have achieved, and they have difficulty in looking outside at people trying to come into this country.</p>
</speech>

<p>Child protection is an important issue. At a previous question-and-answer session in the Assembly some people wondered whether it was suitably positioned in the area of educational underachievement, but we picked the issues of attendance, literacy and numeracy and child protection because we believe that these are key issues in tackling educational underachievement. In most of the schools where performance is lowest, attendance rates are also too low. Teachers cannot teach pupils who are not there. Literacy and numeracy are the basic skills which open the door to the rest of the curriculum and are the skills which employers complain are poor in too many school leavers. All of us have a fundamental duty in respect of child protection. Children cannot learn if they do not feel safe. These issues were identified because they are priorities, North and South. It is important that we get this right and recognise the problems and difficulties that this presents for pupils and parents.</p>
<p>Both Departments are addressing the issues of life skills and the youth sector. Our own curriculum review is examining these issues very closely. Life skills will be a key element of the review and a key element of the revised curriculum.</p>

<p>With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will make a statement about the first North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting on the environment which was held in Interpoint, Belfast on Wednesday 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;2000. Following nomination by the First&nbsp;Minister and the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister, Ms&nbsp;Bairbre&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún and I attended the meeting, which I chaired. The Irish Government were represented by Mr&nbsp;Noel&nbsp;Dempsey TD, Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This statement has been approved by Ms&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún and is also made on her behalf.</p>
<p>The council recognised the important contributions already being made to the care of the environment by the Environment Departments and the agencies involved and by the various co-operative arrangements already in place. Both delegations looked forward to further significant progress arising from their co-operation in the council. The council considered and noted a situation report which reviewed the high level of existing co-operation between the two Departments on the seven environmental issues for enhanced co-operation which were mandated by the first plenary of the North/South Ministerial Council in Armagh on 13&nbsp;December&nbsp;1999. These issues include environmental research, environmental information, environmental protection, sustainable development, catchment-based water quality strategies, agriculture and the environment and waste management in a cross-border context. The paper also identified opportunities for a range of future and joint actions which will provide a work programme for this sector of the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
<p>The council agreed that initial efforts should be concentrated on those areas where strong foundations for joint actions have already been laid and which have the greatest potential for early mutual benefits. Accordingly, it was agreed that environmental research and water quality management should be selected as the initial steps in a rolling programme of work.</p>
<p>In the interests of enhanced co-operation on environmental research, the council approved the establishment of a joint register of current research projects and agreed that officials should work together to identify new technologies for monitoring.</p>
<p>Delegates then noted the current levels of co-operation on matters relating to water quality which were detailed in the second paper tabled at the meeting. The council approved the establishment of a working group of officials to consider matters relating to water quality strategies in relation to the Erne and Foyle catchments and implementation of the proposed EU water framework directive. The Council agreed that the second sectoral meeting on the environment would take place in October in the South.</p>
<p>Finally, the council considered and agreed to a text of a joint communiqué which was issued after the meeting. A copy of the communiqué has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

<p> I thank the Minister for his statement. However, it raises a number of issues that will no doubt interest the members of my Committee. I note from his statement that it has been agreed to establish a working group of officials to look after matters relating to water quality. Can the Minister tell the House how this will be funded? Will the Department&rsquo;s budget, which is already under severe pressure, be increased to facilitate this work? Vital work that the Department of the Environment ought to be taking forward in respect of the Planning Service and the Environment and Heritage Service has not been carried out because of a lack of funding. Surely the diversion of finances and funds to set up more working groups is totally unacceptable for an already highly underfunded Department. On 7&nbsp;September the Committee was informed that some of our built heritage may be lost because of lack of funding.</p>
<p>A new working group partially financed by the Department cannot be justified. I note from the statement that there are already various co-operative arrangements in place. What are those? I am sure my Committee would like to know how those arrangements will operate. The Minister referred to a range of future actions which will provide a work programme for the environment sector. When does he plan to advise the Environment Committee of the details? On this day, our first day back after the summer recess, we have been inundated with cross-border, North/South Ministerial statements. I often wonder who governs this Province, and who has the final say.</p>

<p>I note what the Member says about budgets and finances. We all worry about departmental finances. I am very aware, as is the Assembly, that my Department is under-funded in many aspects. These are issues, which we took under our wing, and which are currently under investigation. These are the initial stages. The issues were chosen to reflect areas where strong foundations for joint action had already been laid and which had the greatest potential for early regional benefits.</p>
<p>The funding issue has not been investigated in depth, but it is something we are aware of. We are looking for cross-border benefits particularly where waterways, pollution and European directives are concerned. There will be many benefits. There will be shared information in areas of mutual interest. There will be less duplication of research with consequent financial benefits. There will be assistance in identifying areas of collaboration, thereby maximising the output from limited resources. There will be assistance in the formulation of joint initiatives which might qualify for European funding, which will be important &mdash; European funding will come into this and will be an area which we will be pursuing. There will be potential efficiencies and cost savings. There will be shared monitoring systems and information on matters of mutual interest. There will be consistent assessment on forecasting environmental trends in both parts of the island in relation to shared resources. There will be the facilitation of future environmental management initiatives.</p>
<p>Those are large, important issues, which have been running for many years. Although these issues are not new, I take the financial aspects into consideration. Where there is mutual benefit, I have no hesitation in working on joint border co-operation.</p>

<p>A North/South body has some advantages. At least we can scrutinise some of the problems and trouble we get from the South of Ireland and have the opportunity to do something about them. The issues discussed at the meeting of the North/South Ministerial sectoral meeting on 28&nbsp;June included environmental research, information protection and catchment-based, water-quality strategies. I was interested to see that environmental research and water-quality strategies were chosen as initial steps in the proposed programme.</p>
<p>I asked the Minister if it was correct that the environmental service of the Republic of Ireland, by neglect and poor control of its own systems, allowed zebra mussels to spread from the Limerick area throughout the Shannon system. It is known that the passage of boats from the Shannon system has spread the scourge of zebra mussels into the Erne system. Will the Minister raise this problem with the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s environment Department? At their next meeting, will the Minister ask what it intends to do about inspecting boats and vessels coming from the Shannon system in order to prevent problems spreading to the Erne system?</p>

<p>The points made by the Member project the absolute need for co-operation on environmental issues. We are concerned when environmental co-operation is lacking. I cannot answer her question at this time. However, the question highlights what cross-border co-operation is about. As we are neighbours, the two jurisdictions need to work together to ensure that environmental issues are properly dealt with.</p>
<p>If we have to contend with them, we will. It is a very important question and one that I can take on board. I want to emphasise the fact that it is important to have co-operation where you have cross-border water issues, and we will be seeking that in the joint Ministerial Council.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement. The council agreed that</p>
<p class="small">&quot;initial effort should be concentrated on those areas where strong foundations for joint action have already been laid and which have the greatest potential for early mutual benefits.&quot;</p>
<p>That is very sensible. The choice of environmental research and water-quality management as initial steps may be timely, particularly in view of the current serious situation regarding water pollution. Does the Minister agree that waste management in a cross-border context is at least as urgent and clearly meets the criteria set down in his statement? As an illustration, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the very valuable work being done by, among others, the north-west region cross-border group, and I suggest that significant mutual benefit would come from early council action in that area.</p>

<p>Waste management is a big issue. The Member referred to ongoing cross-border issues. The UK plan, which is currently under review, takes account of the need to encourage cross-border co-operation on waste management issues, and that is what we are trying to achieve. As regards the proposed changes, import and export of waste for disposal would be permitted where there are sound economic and environmental reasons for such activity and if such activity is included in a district council&rsquo;s waste management plan.</p>
<p>I am confident that these changes will provide sufficient flexibility to promote and encourage co-operation on waste management issues. Waste management is a very important issue. The Member has highlighted it; we will be highlighting it also. The issue will not go unnoticed.</p>

<p>A Cheann Comhairle, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Waste management is an issue currently being discussed, and a consultation exercise is taking place across the island. District and county councils North and South are debating this very important issue. There has been much talk about the waste hierarchy under the generic term of waste management.</p>
<p>There are serious concerns, which public opinion is reflecting. Insufficient attention is being paid to waste reduction. Again, I welcome the joint studies and the reference in the Minister&rsquo;s statement to environmental research. Can the Minister &mdash; particularly given his response to my earlier question that he has no plans to order a moratorium on the construction of incinerator plants &mdash; assure us that this environmental research programme will give proper place to policies on waste reduction that would be enforced by the necessary legislation?</p>
</speech>

<p>The waste management strategy report has been out since March. Undoubtedly, it is a big issue in Northern Ireland. We are very much subject to EU regulations and requirements, and if we do not live up to those requirements infraction proceedings will take place.</p>
<p>I cannot give the Member the assurance he seeks on incinerators. I am not sure what aspect he was referring to. I assure him that the waste management strategy needs the help and the co-operation of everyone in the Province, whether householder or manufacturer. As well as waste disposal, there are the three Rs &mdash; reduce, reuse, and recycle. Currently, they are big issues in my Department, as, indeed, are landfill sites. I assure Members that they will not go unnoticed. They will be taken into consideration. However, it will take the co-operation, help and consideration of all in the community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.8.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90122" speakername="Mr Jim Wilson" time="15:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#8">
<p>I thank the Minister for his statement, and I congratulate him on its content.</p>
<p>In particular, I wish to congratulate him on setting the microscope firmly over the question of water quality. It is mentioned several times in his brief report, but I want to focus on the final page where it is stated that the council approved the establishment of a working group of officials to consider matters relating to water-quality strategies for the Erne and Foyle catchments and implementation of the European Union&rsquo;s water framework directive.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the large chunk of water right in the middle of the Province. It does not straddle the border, and perhaps it is right that for that reason it is not mentioned in this report. My Colleague, Joan Carson, is absolutely right that the scourge of zebra mussel in Lough Erne of which we are all aware and which is understood to have come up from the Shannon, Lough Derg and other places could easily be shifted from the Erne catchment to Lough Neagh. Craft can be lifted out of the water from the Shannon and Lough Erne and come to Lough Neagh, and zebra mussels could be attached to those crafts.</p>
<p>It is also my understanding that commercially caught eels from the Shannon and Lough Erne stop off on the shores of Lough Neagh to be collected by the transporters which ship them to the continent and that the water from the Erne and the Shannon systems is then deposited in Lough Neagh. One can easily see that what has happened is both a tragedy and a disaster.</p>
<p>I have been told that 300,000 zebra mussels can attach themselves to an area of one square metre. I have seen them myself. What would happen if that were to spread from the Shannon catchment area through Lough Erne and into Lough Neagh does not bear thinking about.</p>
<p>While I understand why Lough Neagh is not mentioned in this report, my question to the Minister is this: will the research and the work done on water quality in those other places be put to good use and the lessons learned applied to other waters in the Province?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.8.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90046" speakername="Mr Sam Foster" time="15:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#8">
<p>We have addressed water-quality strategies for the Erne and Foyle catchments because of the cross-border aspect. I can assure the Member that through the water-strategy management, sizeable areas of water such as Lough Neagh and others will certainly be closely examined and guarded.</p>
<p>I am very aware of the mussel problem in Lough Erne. We do not want that to happen consistently &mdash; it has to be stopped; it is difficult for all concerned. There is a big problem in the Erne and right down into the lake at Garrison. I am watching that situation very closely. It will not go unnoticed. I can assure Mr Wilson that we will not forget Lough Neagh or any other waterways. Initially I mentioned the Erne and the Foyle because they are cross-border waterways.</p>

<p>I would like to welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and to pay tribute to him for his involvement over many years in trying to promote meaningful cross-border co-operation.</p>
<p>With regard to agriculture and the environment, I would like the Minister, at the next conference, to address a problem that is prevalent in the counties of Fermanagh, Tyrone, Monaghan and Cavan &mdash; mushroom compost waste. There is a large mushroom industry in those counties, but there is a problem with mushroom compost waste, and I would like it discussed in the future.</p>
<p>I welcome the fact that waste management is being considered in a cross-border dimension. Landfill sites are filling up, and a major problem is developing. I would like to encourage the Minister in that regard.</p>

<p>Agricultural waste was not one of the topics chosen for immediate consideration, but it was identified as being one for possible future action. In the meantime, officials will continue to consult closely with the relevant authorities in the Republic of Ireland to ensure a consistent and complementary approach to this subject.</p>
<p>Landfill, which is a big issue, and waste management are incorporated under the umbrella of waste-management strategy. We will be taking whatever steps necessary and worthwhile to the Province to ensure that we can sort that out. It is a big issue &mdash; agriculture will certainly have to be looked at.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement, and I also welcome his responses to Mr Doherty&rsquo;s questions on waste management. I support the Minister in bringing that forward in the agenda given and in the methodology with regard to waste management that is being used by the north-west cross-border group, and, indeed, we have been joined in that group by other councils in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
<p>With regard to water quality, it is well known that for some time there has been considerable ingress of pollution to the Erne system from the Republic of Ireland. Anglers have been suffering as a result of deterioration in water quality in the Erne system. Will the Minister assure us that when problems are identified, it will be the responsibility of the respective jurisdictions to deal with those problems financially?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.8.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90046" speakername="Mr Sam Foster" time="15:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#8">
<p>We have been alerted to the problems of what may be floating from one jurisdiction into another, and we are concerned about it. Having lived in Fermanagh for a number of years, I have had personal experience of that. The important issue is that we work together in co-operation, under two different jurisdictions, but living as neighbours for each other&rsquo;s benefit. We will work on that aspect to ensure that water pollution does not occur on either side.</p>

<p>Was there any discussion surrounding the major accident hazards directive? This is an EU directive which applies to all EU&nbsp;countries, but it has not been fulfilled by some, including the Irish Republic, which was supposed to fulfil it one year ago. We share the same waters and air space, so if there were a major accident in the Irish Republic, it could have a significant impact on the environment in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Did the Minister raise this matter with the Irish Government, or will he raise it in future meetings with them?</p>

<p>This again emphasises the necessity for good cross-border co-operation. It is all about living together in a neighbourly way, tackling our difficulties and issues of concern, and talking about them to ensure that they are completely eradicated. We will look into anything that is detrimental to Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and we will work in co-operation to ensure that situations like that do not occur.</p>

<p>I ndiaidh domh féin agus an tUasal Dermot Nesbitt bheith ainmnithe ag an Chéad-Aire agus an LeasChéad-Aire, d&rsquo;fhreastail muid ar an chruinniú rannach den Chomhairle. Bhí an tUasal Mícheál Martin, an t-Aire a bhfuil cúram na Roinne Sláinte agus Leanaí air, agus a chomhghleacaí, an Dr Thomas Moffat, Aire Stáit, a bhfuil cúram Sábháilteacht Bia agus Daoine Scothaosta air sa Roinn, ag feidhmiú ar son Rialtas na hÉireann.</p>
<p>Tá an ráiteas seo, a cheadaigh an tUasal Dermot Nesbitt, á thabhairt ar a shon chomh maith.</p>
<p>Fuair an Chomhairle miontuairisc bhéil ón Dr Thomas Quigley, ón Bhord um Chur Chun Cinn Sábháilteacht Bia. Thug sé an t-eolas is déanaí do bhaill na Comhairle faoin struchtúr foirne atá molta don BCCCSB agus faoin obair atá ar siúl faoi láthair le plean corparáideach a sholáthar. Cheadaigh an Chomhairle, i bprionsabal, struchtúr bainistíochta, sracshocruithe foirne agus tús a chur le próiseas earcaíochta le bainisteoirí sinsearacha a aimsiú. Aontaíodh fosta go seolfaí an BCCCSB go foirmiúil i Meán Fómhair 2000. Ach tarlóidh seo i ndiaidh an chéad chruinnithe eile den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas atá le bheith ann i mí na Samhna 2000.</p>
<p>Phléigh an Chomhairle fosta an ról agus an déanamh a d&rsquo;fhéadfadh bheith ann do Choiste Comhairleach an BCCCSB, a chuirfeadh comhairle eolaíoch agus theicniúil ar fáil don bhord.</p>
<p>Thug an Dr Quigley tuairisc ar an dul chun cinn a bhí déanta ag na grúpaí saineolaithe a bunaíodh le cúnamh speisialta a sholáthar i dtaobh sainfheidhmeanna an BCCCSB. Is é an ról atá ag na grúpaí saineolaithe seo ná comhairle a thabhairt don BCCCSB ar an dóigh le roinnt feidhmeanna de chuid an bhoird a chur i gcrích. Is é sin: cur chun cinn sábháilteacht bia; taighde ar shábháilteacht bhia; rabhaidh bhia a scaipeadh; faireachán a dhéanamh ar ghalair i mbia; comhoibriú agus ceangal idir saotharlanna a chur chun cinn; agus saoráidí éifeachtacha ó thaobh costais a fhorbairt le haghaidh tástála i saotharlanna.</p>
<p>Fuair an Chomhairle tuairisc fosta ar an mhéid a bhí curtha i gcrích den chlár oibre a cheadaigh sí taobh istigh de na réimsí sin a aimsíodh le haghaidh comhoibriú i gcúrsaí sláinte ag an chéad chruinniú. Ba iad sin: taighde ar ailse, cur chun cinn sláinte, seirbhísí taisme agus éigeandála, pleanáil i gcomhair olléigeandálaí agus comhoibriú maidir le trealamh ardteicneolaíochta. Dhírigh an Chomhairle a haird go áirithe ar an dul chun cinn luachmhar a bhí déanta ar thaighde ar ailse agus cur chun cinn sláinte. Aontaíodh go gcuirfí moltaí foirmiúla i roinnt de na réimsí seo faoi bhráid na Comhairle le go ndéanfaí cinneadh orthu ag an chéad chruinniú eile.</p>
<p>Chuir an Dr Jane Wilde, stiúrthóir na hInstitiúide Sláinte Poiblí, taispeántas i láthair na Comhairle ina ndearna sí cur síos gairid ar na príomhghníomhachtaí atá ar bun ag an institiúid. Mhol an Chomhairle an cuidiú tábhachtach a bhí an institiúid a thabhairt don earnáil sláinte poiblí ar an oileán.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;aontaigh an Chomhairle ar théacs teachtaireachta a eisíodh i ndiaidh an chruinnithe. Cuireadh cóip den teachtaireacht i Leabharlann an Tionóil.</p>
<p>I wish to report to the Assembly on the meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council held in sectoral format in Dublin on Tuesday 4 July. The meeting considered matters relating to food safety and co-operation on health issues.</p>
<p>Following nomination by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, Mr Dermot Nesbitt and I attended the sectoral meeting of the council. Mr&nbsp;Micheál&nbsp;Martin, the Minister with responsibility for the Department of Health and Children, and his colleague, Dr&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;Moffat, Minister of State with responsibility for food safety and older people at the Department, represented the Irish Government.</p>
<p>This statement has been approved by Mr&nbsp;Dermot Nesbitt and is also made on his behalf.</p>
<p>The council received a detailed oral report from Dr&nbsp;Thomas Quigley of the Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB). Dr&nbsp;Quigley updated the council members on the proposed staffing structure of the FSPB and on the work currently underway to produce a corporate plan. The council approved, in principle, a management structure, outline staffing arrangements and the initiation of a recruitment process for the board&rsquo;s senior management. It was agreed that the Food Safety Promotion Board would formally be launched in September 2000. However, this will now take place following the next meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council, which is scheduled for November.</p>
<p>The council also discussed the possible role and composition of the FSPB&rsquo;s advisory committee that will provide scientific and technical advice to the body.</p>
<p>Dr&nbsp;Quigley provided a progress report on the work of expert groups set up to provide special assistance on the specific functions of the board.</p>
<p>The role of the expert groups is to advise the FSPD on the implementation of a number of functions of the board, including the promotion of food safety, research into food safety, the communication of food alerts, surveillance of food-borne diseases, the promotion of scientific co-operation and linkages between laboratories and development of cost-effective facilities for laboratory testing.</p>
<p>The council also received a report on the progress on implementing the programme of work it had approved at its first meeting in respect of those areas identified for co-operation in the area of health. These were cancer research, health promotion, accident and emergency services, planning for major emergencies and co-operation on high-technology equipment. The council focused particularly on valuable progress being made on cancer research and health promotion. It was agreed that formal proposals for decision in a number of these areas would be put to the council at its next meeting.</p>
<p>The council received an oral presentation from Dr&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;Wilde, director of the Institute of Public Health, in which she outlined key activities being taken forward by the institute. The council paid tribute to the important contribution being made to the public health sector on the island by the institute. The council agreed the text of the communiqué that was issued following the meeting. A copy of the communiqué has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

<p>I am very pleased that the Minister along with her Colleague, Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt, were able to attend the North/South Ministerial Council meeting on 4&nbsp;July, and I welcome her statement. The Minister indicated that the Food Safety Promotion Board would be launched following the next meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council, and I welcome that also.</p>
<p>With regard to this board, surveillance of food-borne disease is mentioned in the document. I am not being cynical about this, but recently on &lsquo;Good Morning, Ulster&rsquo; reference was made to the increase in the number of rats in Dublin. The reason given was the tiger economy in the South, which has meant that many more restaurants have been opened. The BBC gave time to this, and I want to express concern for the public generally, not just for those in the Republic, but for the many thousands from here who travel there. I am not being facetious; they is a very important point.</p>
<p>With regard to the implementation of the programme of work and those areas identified for co-operation in the areas of health, the Minister mentioned cancer research, health promotion and high technology. The subject of cancer research has come up a number of times, and while too many people in Northern Ireland are dying of cancer, sometimes before they even get to see an oncologist, I welcome the research that is being established between the Belfast City Hospital, Dublin and Washington.</p>
<p>I appreciate that some work has been done on health promotion, but does the Minister agree that while there are budgetary constraints on all of these matters, prevention is better than cure? Money has gone to the Health Promotion Board, and health action zones will be playing a major part in disease prevention. It is important that the Minister and the House look at health promotion by whatever bodies that choose to be associated with it.</p>
<p>With regard to high technology, I have made reference before in the Chamber to positron emission tomography (PET). People are familiar with CAT scans and MRI scans, and the next technological development is the positron emission tomography. As I understand it, the Republic on its own can ill-afford this, as it is highly expensive equipment, and I do not think that we here can afford it either. However, on an all-Ireland basis, I am sure that it could be afforded. I know the Minister is aware of that, and I am sure she will give it her attention.</p>
<p>My last point, and perhaps I am being totally facetious, is with regard to the public health aspect that was referred to. I have nothing but admiration for the director of the institute, Dr&nbsp;Jane Wilde. The little point that I want to make is that I, as the Chairman of the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee, have received invitations to seminars or functions to do with that aspect, but they have always arrived at least one to two weeks after the event has taken place. I do not expect the Minister to resolve that; I will work on it myself.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree on the question of surveillance of food-borne disease. One of the reasons why we outlined that as a priority is that such diseases know no boundaries or borders, and co-operation on the matter is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>On health promotion, I note that Dr&nbsp;Hendron talked about the financial constraints. I would love to be able to reassure him that some of our actions in undertaking this work have been to overcome those constraints in different parts of the island.</p>
<p>On the question of health promotion, one major example is in the area of folic acid. We know that taking folic acid prior to conception and during early pregnancy can significantly reduce the risk of difficulties. Throughout Ireland the rates of spina bifida and other neural tube defects are unacceptably high. One very early and practical step in this ongoing work in sharing information and resources will be the development of a campaign to promote the importance of folic acid when planning a pregnancy.</p>
<p>Materials already developed here by the Health Promotion Agency have been shared with the Department of Health and Children to facilitate the development of a public information campaign. In return for this assistance, the Department of Health and Children will meet the costs of running television advertising on UTV as well as on RTE. That will ensure that messages about the importance of folic acid reach target audiences across the island, and it will also address the concerns that the Member has expressed about costs and the best use of limited resources. That shows how this kind of co-operation can be used to overcome these problems.</p>
<p>On the work being undertaken by the Institute of Public Health, one area that will be looked at is the development of information that will lead to better cross-sectoral working. The Member mentioned the health action zones. We will be able to ensure that the kind of cross-sectoral working and the guidance that is needed will be in place for those.</p>
<p>He also mentioned high-technology equipment, and I know that that is an area that he is particularly concerned about. I am very pleased to be able to say that having worked with colleagues in Dublin, we have identified outline objectives for a procurement system, and these effectively will be the terms of reference for a project team. They will include sharing equipment and facilities, telemedicine, information and communications technology and sharing assessments in audit and policy development.</p>
<p>Positron emission tomography, mentioned by the Member, was identified as an area with scope for co-operation and collaboration. Others are the combining of equipment and other programmes to secure better bulk purchase discounts and to encourage keener pricing, building on existing networks, developing shared protocols in relation to medical physics and sharing information about planned capital projects.</p>
<p>There is a whole range.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of mutual working is to ensure the best possible opportunities for the purchase of high-technology equipment and the best possible use of it.</p>

<p>I noted with great interest the paragraph in the Minister&rsquo;s statement which said that the council also discussed the possible role and composition of the Food Safety Promotion Board&rsquo;s advisory committee &mdash; that it will provide scientific and technical advice to the body. It was discussed, and the composition was discussed. I ask the Minister if she will give the Assembly the assurance that any appointees from Northern Ireland will be representative of its population and make-up and well qualified. I also ask her not to proceed with these appointments without any consultation or consideration by the Assembly or the Health Committee as she did when she made the appointments to the hospitals acute review group.</p>

<p>The Food Safety Promotion Board&rsquo;s governing legislation provides for an advisory committee to include scientific experts and representatives of broader food safety interests. Ministers feel that the committee has an important role to play in clarifying scientific advice in the development of research strategy, and, therefore, membership of the committee should reflect a range of interests and disciplines relevant to the function of the Food Safety Promotion Board, such as public health, veterinary science, environmental health and nutrition. Because this is to be an expert committee, all of these people will be appointed because of their expertise and the contribution they can make towards providing advice, as I have said in my statement about the Food Safety Promotion Board.</p>
<p>I notice that the Member referred to the make-up of the membership of a review group which I recently announced. I hope that there was no suggestion that there is any question mark over the integrity, knowledge or expertise of any individual on that group. I am content that the membership I have chosen for the group will have the necessary knowledge and expertise and that they will be able to provide me with the objective expert advice that I need. I know that many, if not all of the group are actively engaged in one way or another in promoting and working across a broad range of interests. Certainly the local members are working in a capacity that allows them to work for the whole community. If the Member has any suggestion that there is a question mark over the integrity, knowledge or expertise of any individual, I hope she will bring that to me. I have not heard any such suggestion.</p>

<p>I do not think my question was fully answered, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was querying the fact that it was appointed without prior consultation and consideration. I hope that some group, other than the Minister, will be consulted in advance and have the opportunity to give consideration to this.</p>

<p>Yes, I am coming to something. It takes me a while building up to it, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I will come to it. I want to say bluntly to the Minister that this situation in respect of childcare, especially in my area, is causing deep concern. I will give one example &mdash;</p>

<p>I think I will be able to elaborate the question. A Member is on her feet, and I wish you would rule on that, Mr Deputy Speaker.

<p>Please sit down. We have been running these questions and answers quite clearly, quite intelligently and quite usefully for two hours now. You have been invited three times to tell me &mdash; to tell all of us &mdash; what this has to do with the North/South Ministerial Council meeting in July of this year.

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
<p>I see from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the North/South Ministerial Council received a report from the Institute of Public Health in Ireland. Where does the work of the institute fit in to the North/South Ministerial Council and the public health strategy that the Executive listed as a key priority in its agenda for Government?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.9.24" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90035" speakername="Ms Bairbre de Brún" time="15:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#9">
<p>I dtús báire, cé nár bunaíodh an institiúid sláinte poiblí faoin Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas, is cinnte go bhfuil sé ceart agus cóir go rachadh obair na hinstitiúide ar aghaidh anois taobh istigh de réim na Comhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas.</p>
<p>Although the institute was not established under the terms of the agreement or as part of the North/South Ministerial Council, it is wholly appropriate that its work programme will now be taken forward under the oversight of the North/South Ministerial Council. The institute is funded by the two Health Departments. The budget for this year is £425,000 sterling, of which my Department will contribute £140,000. It is quite appropriate that that work will now be taken forward under the oversight of the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
<p>As to where it fits into the public health strategy, Members will be aware that the Executive is taking forward a new public health strategy. We have put advertisements in the local newspapers around the whole question of a new public health strategy and have invited members of the public to bring forward their views on key issues, problems and priorities that need to be addressed. I would like to take this opportunity to extend that invitation to Members.</p>
<p>The work of the institute is based around five main themes. These are themes that we have seen in the early days of putting together the public health strategy and the ministerial group on public health and some of the early consultation work which they have done. These are themes that are coming up again in that format. Tackling inequalities is, of course, a central theme. We are tackling inequalities in health and strengthening partnerships for health. This came up earlier when Dr Hendron asked how the work of the institute would lead to better cross-sectoral working in partnerships in improving the health of the population.</p>
<p>Developing international collaboration is another theme, as are public health information, surveillance and capacity building. These are the five themes in the institute&rsquo;s work and are major issues that have arisen in our early efforts to develop the public health strategy.</p>
<p>The report of the Institute of Public Health on the social determinants of health in Ireland will help to build a platform for the development of a future programme. That will be of great benefit to the Executive as we bring forward the public health strategy in a cross-departmental way.</p>
<p>The institute is holding a seminar on public health in Europe, aimed at establishing priorities for further work in the context of the developing European public health programme. It is also carrying out an evaluation of public health on both sides of the border as a preliminary step in a wider programme of North/South public health studies.</p>
<p>That will be of great benefit to us as we carry forward what the Executive has recognised and accepted as a priority area in the Programme for Government.</p>

<p>In her statement, the Minister says that the council also received a progress report on the implementation of the work programme approved at its first meeting. Among the areas listed were accident and emergency services and planning for major emergencies. I am very curious as to what was said about these issues at the council meeting. The Minister has said very little on these issues, and the Republic of Ireland is among six EU countries that the Commission is taking to the European Court of Justice for non-respect of obligations under the major accidents hazard directive. Why did the Minister not tell us that the Republic of Ireland has failed to meet its European obligations in those areas? Why has she not advised us of that, so that the accident and emergency situation for anyone in Northern Ireland who may be caught up in an accident in the border region could be improved?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.9.26" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90035" speakername="Ms Bairbre de Brún" time="15:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#9">
<p>Co-operation on emergency planning has been taking place for a number of years, principally between local hospitals, such as Altnagelvin, in Derry, and Letterkenny Hospital; Daisy Hill in Newry and Louth County Hospital in Dundalk and Erne Hospital in Enniskillen and Sligo Hospital. That should address the Member&rsquo;s concerns about anybody&rsquo;s being caught up in an accident or in a major emergency in the border area. At present, there is no question of any threat to our ability to co-operate in tackling major accidents or emergencies.</p>
<p>There is also co-operation on training. Accident and emergency consultants already operate cross-border courses. There is clear potential for further co-operation, but today I have noticed a tendency among some Members to use questions to try to point out that everything in the South of Ireland is wrong, and that there is nothing wrong here. I hope the Member&rsquo;s question is not posed from that perspective and that he is not trying to make a political point, rather than posing a reasoned question.</p>
<p>Co-operation is clearly to everyone&rsquo;s benefit. It is particularly suited to North/South linkages because of geographical proximity and the convenience of communication. As the Member said, we want to ensure that adjacent or specialist facilities can relieve the pressure on health services either side of the border by providing an initial response.</p>
<p>We intend to set up a small group representing all interests and to draw up clear protocols that can be brought into immediate effect when an emergency occurs. That will ensure the best and fastest response to those affected.</p>

<p>I very much welcome the coming together of both parts of the island to provide good health service. I certainly welcome the presence of Dr&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;Moffat, Minister of State in the South with responsibility for food safety and older people. That is a very interesting title. Food safety is, of course, of vital importance, and I welcome the proposal to launch the Food Safety Promotion Board after the November North/South Ministerial Council meeting.</p>

<p>I have been sitting here all afternoon, and I have got to say that the length of questions and answers has bored me to tears, so I do beg your indulgence &mdash; [Interruption] Let me finish. I am deeply disappointed that nothing in the statement refers to the health of older people. I am sure the people in the North have exactly the same problems as the people in the South. [Interruption] At least older people in the South have free travel and free TV, which we have not, to our shame.</p>
<p>Can the Minister assure this House that the necessary investment for all aspects of cancer research will be made available both in the North and in the South? In relation to emergency services cross-border, what progress has been made with regard to the provision of an air ambulance for the whole island?</p>

<p>Research into the air ambulance question is one of the aspects on which officials are working.</p>
<p>In terms of cancer services, particularly in research, we ought to recognise that the existing co-operation, particularly the setting-up of the tripartite arrangements between ourselves, the whole island of Ireland and the United States has allowed us to work with the best in the field. That has brought us enormous benefits. The work that develops will very clearly bring the necessary improvements to our cancer services and ensure that the development of cancer research here is carried out in a way that makes best use, not only of the kind of scope that is allowed for in an all-island development, but also the particular benefits that working with the National Cancer Institute has brought.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.9.31" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90078" speakername="Mr Alan McFarland" time="16:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#9">
<p>The Minister will be aware of the lengthy and vigorous discussions in the area of cross- border co-operation during the negotiations. She will also be aware that there are &mdash; and she has listed many already &mdash; a number of areas that were in existence beforehand and are there for fully practical reasons. Did the Minister explain to the North/South Ministerial Council why she, in the references for the new task force looking at acute hospitals, has given Dr&nbsp;Maurice&nbsp;Hayes the remit to look specifically at increased cross-border co-operation in acute hospitals? Is this perhaps not a matter for further negotiation to add to the comprehensive list here? Is it not a disrespect to the North/South Ministerial Council that she did not try to set this up officially, rather than through what appears to be a back door with Dr&nbsp;Maurice&nbsp;Hayes?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.9.32" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90035" speakername="Ms Bairbre de Brún" time="16:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#9">
<p>There are two separate points here. It was agreed during the negotiations that ongoing work on accident and emergency services would come specifically under the North/South Ministerial Council. That part would have been discussed at the council. Key officials and professionals on this have met and identified a range of potential North/South linkages of accident and emergency hospital services, and the Member will be glad to know that these areas should form the basis of an interdepartmental scoping study.</p>
<p>I expect that the scoping paper, which we will have in time for the next Ministerial Council meeting, will identify a number of areas in which co-operation in accident and emergency services can be strengthened &mdash; areas such as ambulance services, the sharing of emergency admissions, agreeing referral protocols, agreeing arrangements for transferring patients needing more specialised services, developing proposals for cost sharing and clarifying the legal frameworks for staff treating patients.</p>
<p>Apart from the work specifically mentioned and being done in the North/South Ministerial Council, there is other work that had already been set up or that continues naturally in the course of work between the two Departments. A great deal of work goes on as part of the general working together, for example, between the health boards, and ongoing work that is shared &mdash; not in accident and emergency, but in respect of other hospital services &mdash; has been, to date, on the basis of co-operation or buying-in between health boards. It was felt that if we were reviewing acute hospital services here, it would be useful for that group to be able to look at and build on that existing work. That is why this does not come specifically under the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
<p>I can offer the assurance that there is no question of anything&rsquo;s being done by the back door. Any work arising from the deliberations of this review group will go to the Executive Committee and to the public for consultation, and any proposals brought forward by me will be for the benefit of the people.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that one of the Members from Mr McFarland&rsquo;s party specifically lobbied me &mdash; I will not say who &mdash; but that Member specifically lobbied me. He suggested that in taking forward any work on the review of acute hospital services, we needed to look at the possibility of co-operation between a named hospital in his constituency and a named hospital on the other side of the border.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.9.33" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90086" speakername="Prof Monica McWilliams" time="16:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#9">
<p>My question relates to something that the Minister referred to as an interdepartmental scoping study. I am interested in knowing to what extent these North/South Ministerial Council meetings lend themselves to multidepartmental scoping studies. We heard earlier from the Minister of Education about the group set up to look at the underachievement of children. We know from previous research that this also has an impact upon what the Minister of the Environment might want to say about the background in which those children are being reared and what the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety might have to say about existing inequalities. I would like the Minister to address the extent to which these council meetings enable that to happen.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to agree with what Mr McCarthy said about the health promotion needs of older people. Does the Minister not find it disappointing that on a North/South or a British-Irish basis, Northern Ireland is the only region to be without a centre for dementia. Given the extent of that problem in Northern Ireland, would it not be useful if, in the public health and health promotion areas of her work, the Minister were to pay some attention to setting up a centre that could link North and South and British and Irish?</p>

<p>With regard to older people I gave general responses about the kind of work that is being done. Because of time constraints I did not go into the detail about the age groups that the measures I am proposing would affect. I will look at the Member&rsquo;s specific proposal, although it would not have come in under the specific agenda items to date.</p>
<p>I welcome suggestions from Members and invite other Members to suggest topics for future North/South Ministerial Council meetings in sectoral format.</p>
<p>The Member will know, having been part, as Alan McFarland said, of the lengthy discussions on the format of the North/South Ministerial Council meetings, that there is scope for cross-sectoral meetings. In the last meeting I had, for example, where we discussed health promotion &mdash; and on which I now report &mdash; both Departments recognised the dangers of smoking to health and were concerned at trends showing increases in smoking, particularly among young girls. We therefore plan to share information on this issue with a view to developing a school-based campaign aimed at teenage girls. Obviously, I have spoken to my Colleague, Martin McGuinness, the Minister of Education, about this. The matter will be taken forward with other Departments, and there will be other examples.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.9.35" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90116" speakername="Mr Peter Weir" time="16:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#9">
<p>I refer the Minister to the last three pages of her statement and ask her how much public money has been wasted in translating and reproducing her statement in Irish. Given the fact that all Assembly Members speak English and that even her Colleague, the Minister of Education, felt it unnecessary to reproduce his statement in Irish, is this not a superfluous political exercise?</p>

<p>I note that Members present were part of a group that put together the Standing Orders of the Assembly. They agreed that Members could speak in the language of their choice. Why they agreed to that if they are going to object every time that a Member avails of the opportunity to use that right, I do not understand. There is no question of the provision of health and social services or the work of my Department or others as a concept&rsquo;s being expressed in one language alone. Health and social services are provided for a large community that is varied in terms of community background, social class, need and language. A modern Health Service must be able to cater for that.</p>
<p>I was invited to speak at a conference at the weekend at which an eminent international speaker pointed out that there may be far greater obligations upon us in relation to the use of Irish than we at present fulfil. It is not a waste of public money or time. However, given the fact that Members&rsquo; parties agreed that I should have this right, the constant repetition of this question may, indeed, be wasteful.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat. I welcome the statement made by the Minister on the last North/South Council Meeting. I also welcome the fact that cancer and cancer research are identified as areas for co-operation. I would like to point out, however, that coronary heart disease is another major killer of people in Ireland. Is there any scope for tackling this on an all-Ireland basis through the North/South Ministerial Council? Go raibh maith agat.</p>

<p>Bhí caibidil ann idir an dá Roinn faoi na tosaíochtaí ó thaobh cur cinn sláinte. Is cinnte go raibh an t-ábhar a luaigh an Teachta Tionóil &mdash; tinneas croí &mdash; ina thosaíocht.

<p>Discussion between the two Departments has led to the identification of shared priorities for health promotion. Ms Ramsey has made a point about heart disease, and it is very clear that this area will be a priority.</p>
<p>Tackling the high rate of coronary heart disease across Ireland is a priority; it is unacceptably high in both parts of the island. Clearly that is an area that can and will be taken forward. We hope to support that work with joint public information initiatives in areas such as smoking and diet and exercise. I have dealt with Prof McWilliams&rsquo; question on smoking and how we hope to take that forward.</p>
<p>On tobacco control, we are closely monitoring and discussing the proposals, both in Dublin and London, to tighten up issues such as smoking in public places, tobacco advertising and sales of cigarettes to young people. I will be looking at that very carefully.</p>
<p>In tackling heart disease, we hope to embark on a longitudinal study of heart health that would inform both Departments on the effects of current lifestyles on heart disease and help us identify future trends. Members talked earlier about whether resources are being wasted. This is a clear example of how co-operation on health promotion makes sound sense. From a health perspective the common problems and priorities and the similarity in population profile mean there is a mutual benefit to be derived from collaboration. From a value-for-money perspective there are obvious economies of scale in joint public information campaigns, training sessions and research projects. Clearly, this is an issue to be tackled &mdash; one where we can, and will, work together.</p>
<p>Overall, the proposed work programme reflects existing health promotion priorities on both sides of the border and the potential benefit to be gained from tackling these together, rather than pursuing them in isolation.</p>

<p>Following a nomination by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, Dr Sean Farren and I attended the sectoral meeting of the council. Ms Mary Harney TD, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, represented the Irish Government. This report has been approved by Dr Farren and is also made on his behalf.</p>
<p>I wish to refer to two earlier interventions by Mr S Wilson and Rev Dr William McCrea, neither of whom is now in the Chamber. These reports are approved and made on behalf of both Ministers as part of the checks and balances of the system. It is a cornerstone of the arrangements and is absolutely vital.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reason that there are a number of these statements today is that we are under an obligation to report to this House at the first available opportunity after the meeting. I dare say there would be complaints if we did not do so.</p>
<p class="italic">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
<p>The council received a verbal report from Mr Liam Nellis, interim chief executive of the body, on the progress to date in taking forward the work of the body. He reported on progress in relation to studies on an equity investment fund, graduate placement programmes, testing and analytical services, standards certification and accreditation programmes. Mr Nellis also reported on arrangements to establish the body&rsquo;s headquarters in Newry.</p>
<p>The council approved a paper outlining the activities of the body for the year 2000 and the associated budget. The council approved codes of conduct for staff and board members of the body. The council noted progress to date on the recruitment of a chief executive for the body. The council agreed that its next meeting in this sectoral format would take place in Northern Ireland in October. The council agreed the text of a communiqué, which was issued following the meeting. A copy has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

<p>: I welcome the statement from the Minister. Can the Minister elaborate on the details of the body&rsquo;s headquarters in Newry and outline the activities of the body for the year 2000, its budget the code of conduct for the staff, board and members of the body? I would like to see a bit more detail being given to the House today.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90041" speakername="Sir Reg Empey" time="16:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>When the North/South bodies were agreed the location of the headquarters of the various bodies were an integral part of that agreement. In this case the decision was that the body&rsquo;s headquarters would be in Newry. I am pleased to say that progress has been made. I believe that a site has been identified at the gasworks in Newry, and progress is being made on preparing that for occupation, which I hope will take place shortly.</p>
<p>It was also an integral part of the agreement that all these organisations would have codes of conduct for their boards and staff. One of the duties of the North/South Ministerial Council is to approve both of those codes of conduct. That work was transacted at the North/South Ministerial Council at the end of June, and codes of conduct were approved. If they are not already available to the Member in the Assembly Library, I will undertake to ensure that they are provided.</p>
<p>The activities of the trade body are set out in the legislation &mdash; part of the agreement identified the agenda that it would work to. However, the agenda is much larger than the current work programme, because it is impossible to do everything at once. There are four key areas on which the body has to report soon. Those areas are a North/South equity investment fund; the development of graduate and other placement programmes; the carrying out of a range of testing services for industry; and the certification programmes &mdash; that is the implementation of standards development and certification on a North/South basis.</p>
<p>The business of the body when it meets next month will be to receive reports on those four areas, as they were time-limited in the agreement. I understand that work has been completed on all four, and Ms&nbsp;Harney, Dr&nbsp;Farren and I are expecting to receive a report on those areas when we meet in October. The meeting will take place in Northern Ireland, and we will be in a position to report to the Assembly immediately thereafter.</p>

<p>I welcome the statement by the Minister. I applaud the efforts of the Minster and Sean&nbsp;Farren to provide joined-up Government. Both have realised the linkages between their departmental responsibilities. That is very much outlined in the four key areas of study. Will the Minister update the Assembly as soon as possible after his October meeting on the progress that has been made in these areas?</p>
<p>In the communiqué, reference was made to an initiative on e-commerce. Can the Minister update us on what is happening and say whether or not the issue of tendering and public procurement is part of that initiative?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90041" speakername="Sir Reg Empey" time="16:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>Yes. I can give the Member an undertaking that immediately the opportunity presents itself after the October meeting, we will be making a report here. I hope to be in a position to give the Member an indication of the contents of the reports on the four areas of activity and on our response. I have not yet had an opportunity to see them. I do not know whether we will be able to agree them or not, but we will be in a position to make a factual report as soon as we have seen the material and taken decisions on it.</p>
<p>With regard to e-commerce, the trade and business development body held a seminar in Fermanagh in June this year, which was its first major exercise. It attracted an audience of 60 key business people, 30 from each side of the border, and a number of American visitors were invited &mdash; people who had succeeded on the Internet as young companies who had started off in a variety of different areas of activity. They came to give their testimony, as it were, to the invited business people from both sides of the border.</p>
<p>I attended the seminar briefly for lunch and met the delegates. I understand that officials described the day as being highly successful, and those people whom I spoke to said that they had been immensely impressed by the information they received from people who had succeeded in taking a very simple idea and translating it on to the Internet. One particular person created tremendous wealth for himself and his company as a result. Others were at different stages of development. It proved to different companies what was achievable by pursuing this path, and that was one of the exercises undertaken by the body. It was its first major public move. There are others planned for later in the autumn, but I hope to elaborate more fully on that when we get to the next report.</p>
<p>As far as public procurement is concerned, trade and supply chains make up a key area of activity for this body. I have to say that this is one of the areas which, from the trade point of view, I am most anxious to pursue, because it will provide the quickest way of improving trade.</p>
<p>As the Member may be aware, we have clearly been making progress in the Republic of Ireland market in the last five or six years. It has grown very considerably. We are experiencing difficulties right now because of the currency differential which is running at about 29%, and this is causing problems. Nevertheless, the level of trade is still improving, albeit not at the rate that it was a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Part of our objective in developing supply chains is to make companies aware of what may be available around the corner and to reduce the length of supply lines, thereby reducing the necessity to hold stock and subsequently improving the efficiency and the cost base of businesses.</p>
<p>European regulations have a major role to play in public procurement, because, as the House will know, major public procurements have to be advertised in the &lsquo;European Journal&rsquo;. This does not take away from the fact that one of the things that has not been happening on a sufficient scale is the level of cross-border trade. While it has been growing in recent years, it is still a very small percentage of the total amount of trade in both jurisdictions. The degree to which it is able to make an impact in this area is something on which the success of this body will be measured.</p>

<p>I very much welcome the statement by the Minister. I share many interests with him such as the enterprise, trade and investment agenda and the issues contained therein. Would it be possible to have the North/South Ministerial Council move forward more aggressively on the tourism agenda? We are told that our gross domestic product from tourism here is around 2% and that the aim is to increase this to 6% or 7% &mdash; perhaps 5% in the meantime. This is one of the benefits which could arise from a North/South agenda. Would it be possible to report on progress with the development of the special tourism company which was to be set up to work that agenda? Would it also be possible to have a statement at some stage in the not-too-distant future?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the wider picture of inward investment I would like to know how much constructive co-operation is taking place between the IDB and the IDA in the South and how that co-operation might be developed in a way that specifically benefits inward investment in Northern Ireland.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90041" speakername="Sir Reg Empey" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>There is a variety of issues there, not all of which are the direct responsibility of the trade and business development body. The North/South Ministerial Council has not yet met to establish the tourism company, but that will, I hope, happen next month. I am meeting Dr&nbsp;McDaid tomorrow. The speed at which we can establish the company will depend on a number of issues being finalised tomorrow. I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to the Executive next month, and we are aiming to have the body established then.</p>
<p>Investment is not part of the remit of the trade and business development body, however co-operation clearly is. For the information of Members, the IDB and the IDA met in May this year, and a press release was issued on 15&nbsp;May. They are investigating which areas could benefit from co-operation. Clearly they already co-operate with other inward investment organisations throughout the United Kingdom, and this ensures that they are not used and abused by potential inward investors who may try to create a Dutch auction between them, whereby people go around the various organisations trying to bid up their projects. This mechanism is already in place. We have concordats with Scotland and Wales specifically to ensure that there is no exploitation of our position there, and there are similar informal arrangements with the IDA.</p>
<p>A working group was formed following the meeting in May to look, on a pilot basis, at marketing in the north- west area. The councils in Londonderry, Limavady and Strabane, as well as Donegal County Council, cover this area. Those four local authority areas are being looked at.</p>
<p>The group consists of executives from both the IDB and the IDA and works in consultation with the north-west cross-border group and Derry Investment Initiative. Objectives include the establishment of a joint marketing database and the co-ordinating of the handling of visits. These are elementary things that can be done. A similar grouping exists in the area of tourism, and they are looking at that as a pilot project.</p>
<p>An example of this type of co-operation in practice is a forthcoming visit, hosted by the IDB, by members of the Japanese Software Association. The group will spend a significant amount of time in Londonderry and will also visit Letterkenny. This pilot project is ongoing. The group has not yet produced a report &ndash; it met for the only time in May. I discussed the matter with the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce last week. They are interested in the project and obviously feel that the region as a whole may add up to more than the sum of its constituent parts, and they are very enthusiastic about pursuing these matters. I will report to the House when we know the outcome.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90015" speakername="Dr Esmond Birnie" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>My question relates to the equity investment fund. The North/South trade and business development body is currently evaluating the necessity of having such a fund. There are already a number of private- and publicly-funded venture capital funds operating in Northern Ireland. Will the Minister confirm that the remit of the research to evaluate a possible future equity investment fund will seek to establish whether there is a necessity for a further source of venture capital funding on a North/South basis? Would further provision crowd out the existing provision?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90041" speakername="Sir Reg Empey" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>The genesis of this item on the agenda dates back two years to the negotiations that went on to establish these bodies. The specific remit was that the body would bring forth proposals on the development of a North/South equity investment fund programme. This was to take account of the effectiveness of the existing range of equity and fund provision, North and South, for consideration and decision by the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
<p>Since that agreement was reached, the market has changed. There are more people in the market; the nature of the venture capital market has changed, and there is a somewhat greater range of products available. The study will establish whether there are gaps in the market and whether a niche market exists. It is one of the key areas that will be brought forward for decision in October. I have not seen the final report, but we will have to ensure that whatever is proposed is complementary to the existing range of products and will not simply replace it or run in parallel with it.</p>
<p>There are complaints, from time to time, that the venture capital industry is offering loans on far too great a scale and which are beyond some of the smaller companies. However, the market has improved, and there is a range of facilities. The biggest problem is not so much the lack of venture capital but the lack of projects for venture capital. There is a reluctance and resistance in our business community to participate and benefit from venture capital. There is a resistance to the idea of letting go of part of the company to venture capital investors. People think it is their own, and they want to hold on to it. The culture of venture capital has not got through to business here.</p>
<p>If one looks at what is happening in the United States of America and, to a growing extent, in the Republic, one will see that there is more enthusiasm for venture capital. That is how much of the small business sector in the United States has progressed &mdash; people have been prepared to take the view that half a loaf is better than no bread. That culture has not yet developed here. It is not so much the supply side that is the problem; it is the demand side.</p>
<p>I understand the point that the Member is making, and we would not be serving anybody well if we accepted a venture capital fund that merely duplicated what was already available in the commercial sector. I look forward to the report, and I hope that it is able to establish that there may be niche markets, and address, in particular, the tailoring of product, especially for the small-and medium-sized enterprises sector, that would fill a gap that already exists in the market. That remains to be determined, and I may be in a position next month to make further comments in that regard.</p>

<p>The content of my question was referred to by Dr Birnie. However, I would like to pursue it with the Minister. I welcome the statement the Minister has made. The equity investment fund has potential, and I would like the North/South body to pursue it so that, in particular, graduates coming out of the universities who may have good research ideas on developing new products can be encouraged. I ask the Minister to ensure that the existing vested interests &mdash; investment bodies and big banks &mdash; do not curtail this investment fund.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90041" speakername="Sir Reg Empey" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>I am surprised that the hon Member did not ask me if we were going to establish an equity investment fund specifically for West Tyrone. He protected me from that, but I know that that is what he really meant. <i>[Laughter]</i> The fact remains that there is an issue with regard to the development of graduate and other placement programmes. I know that Dr Farren has very strong views on this matter and is actively pursuing it from his own departmental point of view. I assure the Member that vested interests, whether in the banking sector or in others, will not be permitted to block or influence this. We are not interested in replacing what banks are doing. The problem is that many of us regard much of what the banks do in regard to development as lacking in imagination, particularly in relation to small-and medium-sized enterprises. Those of us who have been studying the American situation &mdash; and I include our experiences last month &mdash; were very impressed that banks in the United States of America are under an obligation to assist their communities. Indeed, they are key players in economic development at the sharp end of taking risks.</p>
<p>There is no point in lending to a sure bet; anybody can do that. There has to be a degree of imagination and risk. Some new thinking has to be introduced. There is no point in putting the umbrella out when the sun is shining and taking it away when the rain begins. Many small businesses, and particularly individuals, may not have a sufficiently strong credit rating due to the fact that they have not been able to get on to the ladder in the first place.</p>
<p>I am hoping that the report will point out some ways in which people in those circumstances can benefit. The aspire programme already deals with micro-lending, but we are talking about something a little further up the line where people who have ideas are not thwarted through lack of funding. I know that the problem may often be that the public sector grant-giving facilities, loan facilities and commercial banking facilities through the clearing banks leave out a significant sector of the potential market, and I hope that we will be able to find a way of filling that particular gap &mdash; even in west Tyrone &mdash; in order to avoid that&rsquo;s occurring.</p>

<p>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s report. What sort of consultation and input will we have in relation to the South&rsquo;s economic development strategy, which will be coming out in a year&rsquo;s time, in terms of the joint strategies? Through that and other work to be done by the North/South Ministerial Council how can we target and tackle areas of underinvestment, particularly in rural areas in respect of rural development and agri-schemes? Can the Minister say something about the recruitment of the executive officer?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90041" speakername="Sir Reg Empey" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>The Member is getting a number of points in here. The Republic may well be developing a new strategy, although, obviously, we will not have an input into that. However, the Member can have an input to the strategy that the trade and business development body comes up with, not only when reports come before the House and he has the opportunity to ask questions, but also at Committee level.</p>
<p>Members of the trade and business development body &mdash; or any other implementation body &mdash; can be invited to attend Committee meetings of this House. The policy and proposals of those bodies can be scrutinised by Assembly Committees, and individuals, including those from the trade and business development body, when invited, are required to attend and put across their positions.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility that whenever we are debating, on an annual basis, budgetary or other matters, the House as a whole will have the opportunity to contribute and make suggestions. I must point out to the hon Member that the Committee structure here affords a much greater opportunity to get into a great deal more detail than might be possible in a question-and-answer session such as this.</p>
<p>With regard to the appointment of the executive officer, the consultants Deloitte&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Touche were appointed to assist the trade and business development body with the recruitment process. Advertisements have appeared, and a panel consisting of two directors of the company, together with an independent representative, will have been sitting and shortlisting. I am hoping that a recommendation may be available for us next month and that we would then be in a position to make an appointment. That is, of course, one of the functions of the North/South Ministerial Council. I will, of course, bring any outworkings of that to the House as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I also welcome the good work of the Minister and his Colleague and Minister, Seán Farren. Having listened to the statements, I have been struck by the good, positive message that we must be sending out to our community as we move towards the end of business today, particularly since this work is coupled with the work which has already begun on the Programme of Government. We should take great heart that the House and the Executive are getting down to business and beginning to provide what our community wants.</p>
<p>The verbal account from Liam&nbsp;Nellis reported progress on a number of things. I was particularly interested in the graduate placement programme. Will the Minister give us more information on that and tell us how it may assist in promoting the objectives of the trade and business development body?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.16" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90041" speakername="Sir Reg Empey" time="16:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>The proceedings today have shown that a great deal of work is going on. No mention has been made, however, about the co-operation that goes on daily with Ministers from Whitehall and other places and through meetings of the joint Ministerial Council. This work and co-operation is going on constantly. There was criticism that the Assembly has met only on a certain number of days, but, of course, no mention was made of the fact that the Committees of the House have been meeting frequently. Some of them, including the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, met during the recess. Those hours of Committee work seem to have been conveniently forgotten. There are still some people out there who think that this is just a cut-down version of Parliament and that it works in exactly the same way as Westminster, but it does not. It is going to take a little time for this to filter through and for the general public to realise that work in the Chamber is only one part of what Members have to do.</p>
<p>Graduate and other placement programmes on a North/South basis are designed to perform the same function as the explorers programme for which my Department has responsibility. This is a programme which places graduates in work somewhere in North America or Europe to give them experience.</p>
<p>While I have not yet seen the report &mdash; and this may be an area in which Dr&nbsp;Farren has more expertise &mdash; it is, nevertheless, the objective to use best practice to exchange ideas, to network and to give people the experience of working outside their home environment. At times we have a very parochial attitude, and people sometimes will not work on the other side of the road. We even have difficulty getting people to move around in this city. In some cases, there is justification for that, but sometimes there is just too parochial an approach. Placement programmes are not new, but they need to be developed. For example, with regard to tourism and hotel management, we are running at only about one third of what our level of activity should be.</p>
<p>Consequently, by definition, people in the Republic who have an industry running at about 6% of GDP, or slightly greater, have a more sophisticated industry than ours, and lessons could be learned there. That is only one example. The general principle is to give people an opportunity to go into a different environment to gain knowledge and expertise and to bring that back to enrich our economic ability to do well. Our biggest economic asset is our people.</p>
<p>Therefore, the greater the skills, experience, expertise and knowledge that they have in their subject &mdash; be it in e-commerce or hotels &mdash; the greater the benefit to the economy of Northern Ireland. There are also things that we can teach in Northern Ireland &mdash; it would not be one-way traffic. The idea is to have a scheme akin to an exchange programme where people would experience working in a different jurisdiction. We have companies that can teach others from outside. That is the general idea. It is a sensible one, and I can see only benefit from it. I hope to be in a better position next month to give a fuller and more detailed report. By that time I will have received a report from Mr&nbsp;Nellis on the progress of his work programme.</p>

<p>The Northern Ireland Women&rsquo;s Coalition welcomes the North/South co-operation in these areas. The Minister referred to forthcoming issues on the agenda. He mentioned job creation and job promotion in the areas of e-commerce, and so on. However, does the safeguarding of jobs come into that jurisdiction in the context of North/South co-operation. I have grave concerns about the future of Harland and Wolff. On a North/South basis there is speculation in the press about wind turbines being built for renewable energy in the South. This would be very valuable in terms of protecting and safeguarding tens of hundreds of jobs at Belfast shipyard. What does the Minister think can be done, whether in a North/South context or in a Northern Ireland context, to protect the jobs at Harland and Wolff?</p>

<p>I must compliment the Member on her ingenuity in working that subject into a question on this issue. My intention was to make a statement this afternoon about the situation at Harland and Wolff. However, in the absence of a determination on the arbitration and, therefore, the company&rsquo;s response to it, I have had to withdraw that application, because it would be premature.</p>
<p>We have to understand what the trade and business development body is doing. There is no need to work through it with regard to those things that the Member has been talking about &mdash; safeguarding jobs, and so on. If an issue of an economic nature comes up that Ms&nbsp;Harney and myself have a joint interest in, I would have no hesitation in contacting her, and I have done so in the past.</p>
<p>The subject of wind turbines is an energy issue. I had discussions with Mrs&nbsp;O&rsquo;Rourke, the Minister for Public Enterprise, on Friday. We discussed a whole range of energy matters including renewables, but those things are some way down the track. A pilot project into the potential for wind energy on the west coast of the Republic of Ireland has been commissioned following a report by Kirk&nbsp;McClure&nbsp;Morton. There is a pilot scheme going on there, and the first licence is about to be issued. However, it will be some time before the outworking of that would have any meaningful application for Harland and Wolff.</p>
<p>As I said, this is not necessarily relevant to my statement, but the Member knows that I have spent a great deal of time dealing with this company. I also had the support of my Colleagues, Sean&nbsp;Farren and Mark&nbsp;Durkan &mdash; indeed, of the entire Executive &mdash; in preparing responses in the event of the news that is widely canvassed and anticipated. However, I would prefer to wait until we know the outcome of the arbitration and the company&rsquo;s reaction to it before making public comment. Had that information been available to me today I would have made a statement, but I may have to report on the outcome later in the week by means of public comment. I will ensure that the Member receives a copy of that when it becomes available.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister and my Colleague for their work in the Ministerial Council. It is very good news that the council&rsquo;s headquarters will shortly be established in Newry. Despite the national importance of the body&mdash;and I know the Minister might interpret that differently&mdash; my question is nonetheless very parochial. Can the Minister give any indication as to the estimated staff complement that will be based in Newry? Can he give any indication if the Ministerial Council, when it meets in sectoral format, will actually meet in its headquarters? If that were to be the case does he agree that we will need substantial investment in the infrastructure, roads and rail communications with Newry?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2000-09-11.10.20" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90041" speakername="Sir Reg Empey" time="16:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/000911.htm#10">
<p>Well, the Member got everything in bar the kitchen sink. As I said, it was agreed in advance that the headquarters would be in Newry. I do not know whether the Member had anything to do with the lobbying for that. Undoubtedly, he tells people in Newry that it was all due to him, and I am not going to argue with him.</p>
<p>There are currently 14&nbsp;people employed by the body, and most of these are seconded from the Northern Ireland Civil Service and that of the Republic. The number of core staff will eventually rise to 26, although the body has statutory provision to employ up to 42. The current plans are for the employment of 26&nbsp;people, and they would be primarily based in Newry. At the moment, the temporary headquarters is in Londonderry&nbsp;House, Belfast. We have now got the former gasworks site in Newry for which terms have been agreed. It is hoped to relocate current staff to temporary premises in Newry within the next few weeks while the permanent premises are completed and fitted out. I cannot be absolutely precise about the timing of the move, but I will have a report next month from Mr&nbsp;Nellis on the actual timetabling.</p>
<p>With regard to the Member&rsquo;s comment about the infrastructure in the Newry area, I shall have to take his word for it. I have no doubt that improvements can be made. The words &quot;trade&quot; and &quot;Newry&quot; are almost synonymous. Whatever our constitutional views might be, Newry is a town at the crossroads; it is at the border, and it has enjoyed the reputation of being able to accommodate folk from all sides. I understand that the shopkeepers do not turn away any currency.</p>
<p>I hope, therefore, that the establishment of the body in Newry will have a positive impact on the economy of the area. The next meeting of the council will in October in Northern Ireland, but I cannot confirm where it will be located. We used a hotel in the Newry area last time, and I suspect we may do so again.</p>

<p class="small">That the period referred to in Standing Order 31(4) be extended by 14&nbsp;calendar days to 16&nbsp;October 2000, in relation to the Committee Stage of the Weights and Measures (Amendment) Bill (NIA8/99).</p>
<p>A Cheann Conhairle, thank you for the opportunity of speaking today in support of the motion. I would like to give some background and reasons why we want the extra 14&nbsp;days. The Bill received its second reading on 22&nbsp;June. The Assembly went into recess on 4&nbsp;July although, as the Minister pointed out, my Committee did not go into recess until mid-August. Some of us then went off to the States to continue the work. Nevertheless, during the recess period we did involve the process of public consultation by public advertisements.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the Committee will be having its first chance to meet with the Minister and his officials to deal with further detail in the Bill. We are, therefore, requesting the extra time to take on board what responses may yet come from the public and the responses we expect from the Minister and his officials tomorrow. Running alongside the Committees dealing with the Bill has of course been the ongoing work of the Committee, which has been in public session for some time.</p>
<p>We intend to stay in public session throughout September. Given all of those reasons it would not be an undue delay to seek an extra 14 calendar days to give our Committee time to consider the Bill, fulfil its requirements and report back to the Assembly.</p>
<p class="italic">Question agreed to.</p>
<p class="italic">Resolved:</p>
<p class="small">That the period referred to in Standing Order 31(4) be extended by 14 calendar days to 16 October 2000, in relation to the Committee Stage of the Weights and Measures (Amendment) Bill (NIA8/99).</p>

<p>I advise the Member and, indeed, the House that it is not possible for someone whose name is not down to propose the motion. The motion therefore falls. There is a maximum of two names for any motion. Either of those people may propose but not anyone else. The motion may, of course, be tabled for a subsequent sitting. If this becomes a problem, we may look at it again, but at this juncture we must let the motion fall.</p>
