<p>The First Minister and I wish to make a statement to report to the Assembly on the recent transport sectoral meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council, which were held in Belfast on Tuesday, 19 December 2000. The First Minister and I have taken the lead on transport in both councils. It is vital that transport issues be addressed in these two new institutions to ensure that the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland can reap the greatest possible benefit from sharing knowledge and experience, and from co-operation with our neighbours in the South of Ireland, in Great Britain and the other members of the British-Irish Council.</p>
<p>I will make the report on the North/South Ministerial Council meeting, and the First Minister will make the report on the British-Irish Council meeting. This statement has been agreed by Mr&nbsp;Sam&nbsp;Foster, who attended both sectoral meetings, and we make it on his behalf also.</p>
<p>Transport was one of the six areas for enhanced co-operation through existing bodies, North and South, agreed at the inaugural plenary meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council held in Armagh in December&nbsp;1999. The North/South Ministerial Council transport sectoral meeting held on 19&nbsp;December 2000 was the first meeting in this sectoral format. The Irish Government were represented by Mary&nbsp;O&rsquo;Rourke&nbsp;TD, Minister for Public Enterprise, and Noel&nbsp;Dempsey&nbsp;TD, Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The First Minister, Mr Foster and I represented the Executive.</p>
<p>The council considered three broad transport issues at the meeting &mdash; strategic transport planning, rail safety and road safety. The council noted that there is already substantial co-operation between the relevant Departments and agencies North and South, on a range of strategic transport planning and road and rail safety issues.</p>
<p>With regard to strategic transport planning, the council identified a number of opportunities for co-operation between North and South. These included potential benefits from the exchange of information on the transportation aspect of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shaping Our Future&rsquo; document and Ireland&rsquo;s development plan and its proposed national spatial strategy. This exchange of information is important to ensure that each jurisdiction can benefit from the research and analysis that the other has carried out. The council also recognised that there was scope to develop our major cross-border road, rail and bus services through enhanced co-operation, exchange of information and experience to enable us to have the best possible transport system in place. Further possibilities for co-operation were the implementation of public and private partnership, transport and the development of sustainable transport.</p>
<p>The council discussed rail safety and agreed that there were opportunities for further co-operation between North and South on legislative proposals for railway safety and standards. It also acknowledged that there would be benefits from the exchange of information and experience on railway safety and on specific accidents or incidents. The council agreed that early meetings with officials would be convened to prepare detailed work programmes on strategic transport planning and rail safety for consideration and approval at a future council meeting.</p>
<p>The council also discussed and approved a programme for enhancing North/South co-operation on road safety. The programme will include joint road safety campaigns and consideration of the possibility of joint promotion of road safety educational initiatives. Departments, North and South, will also exchange information on road safety programmes, targets and priorities. They will explore the scope of a common approach with regard to road safety to the mutual recognition of penalty point offences between both jurisdictions. No driver should regard the border as providing the opportunity to escape his or her responsibilities. An early meeting of officials is to be convened to consider the detailed arrangements and timescales for taking this programme forward with a view to reporting back to a future meeting of the council.</p>
<p>The council also dealt with a number of items of business relating to other North/South Ministerial Council sectors. The council appointed Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;McKinney as the chief executive of the Special EU Programmes Body. The council also appointed the members of the board of Tourism Ireland Limited, the newly established North/ South tourism company. The council agreed that the recommended candidate would be acceptable for appointment as chief executive to Waterways Ireland. The name of the candidate will be announced in due course following agreement on salary and conditions of service.</p>
<p>It was agreed that the next North/South Ministerial Council transport sectoral meeting would take place in March 2001. A copy of the communiqu√© issued after the meeting has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

<p>I would like to report on the British-Irish Council meeting. Transport was identified at the first British-Irish Council summit meeting in London in December 1999 as one of the issues for discussion among the Administrations in sectoral format, and it was agreed that the Northern Ireland Executive would take the lead in this area.</p>
<p>As the Deputy First Minister has said, he and I are taking this matter forward because we recognise the benefits to the people of Northern Ireland from co-operation on transport with other British-Irish Council members.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the British-Irish Council transport sector was held in Belfast on 19 December 2000. The Deputy First Minister, Mr Sam Foster and I represented the Northern Ireland Executive. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government was represented by Lord Macdonald, Transport Minister at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The Irish Government was represented by Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, Minister for Public Enterprise, and Noel Dempsey, Minister of the Environment and Local Government. Representatives of the Administrations in Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey also attended.</p>
<p>We had a wide-ranging discussion covering various aspects of transport. It was recognised that transport cannot be viewed as an issue in isolation. Members of the council agreed on the need for an integrated and sustainable approach to transport issues that would take account of the relevant economic, social and environmental context.</p>
<p>The key issues for each of the member Administrations were identified in discussion. It was acknowledged that members placed different emphases on particular issues. For example, the smaller, remote islands are heavily dependent on their sea and air links, while for other Administrations, including ourselves, road and rail development, as well as adequate access to ports and airports, is vital.</p>
<p>The meeting also recognized that consideration of issues such as urban congestion would bring benefits to all and agreed the need to consider the impact of new technologies on transport. All members agreed that road safety is a key issue where the sharing of knowledge and expertise may help to make significant reductions in the unacceptable number of people killed or injured on our roads.</p>
<p>As a first step, the council considered a range of options with a view to identifying those where co-operation among members would be of greatest benefit. The options identified included sharing knowledge and experience in areas such as the development of public and private partnerships and other sources of funding. Co-operation on the development of sustainable transport policies and programmes to improve road and rail safety were also considered. Particular emphasis was placed on the examination of the potential for improved linkages with peripheral regions and on the difficulties in relation to air links with London, where the pressure on slots at Heathrow has limited the access to London from regional airports.</p>
<p>From Northern Ireland&rsquo;s viewpoint, we emphasised the importance to us of improved road links, such as the Heysham to M6 route, and of the potential riverside quay on the Mersey, which would significantly reduce the turnaround time of ships in Liverpool. Development of this infrastructure will greatly assist access from Northern Ireland to Britain and to Europe.</p>
<p>The council agreed that the Northern Ireland Executive would convene an early meeting of senior officials to examine options and prepare detailed recommendations for work in a number of initial priority areas. These priorities will include exchanges of information and experience, particularly in relation to public and private partnerships, including the consideration of a possible mechanism to facilitate such exchanges. They will also address regional air links and the potential for co-operation on road safety and integrated transport. The recommendations will then be submitted to a further British-Irish Council meeting for approval. A copy of the communiqu√© issued following the meeting has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

<p>I thank the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister for their reports providing evidence of welcome and useful work, for the general good, in transport. I will ask a question about the North/South aspect and then one in relation to the British-Irish Council.</p>
<p>Could the NSMC, in its future sectoral meetings, investigate why, notwithstanding the many millions of pounds of, often European-backed, funding directed to the Belfast-Dublin rail route, the speeds of the trains are still very low by European standards? Intercity speeds of over 100 mph are common, whereas the Belfast-Dublin route of 100 miles still takes over 2 hours.</p>
<p>With respect to the British-Irish Council, I welcome the evidence of work on air links. Could it investigate the frequency &mdash; <i>[Interruption]</i></p>

<p>Order. Does the Member have a question? The purpose is to ask questions.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90015" speakername="Dr Esmond Birnie" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>Yes, there is a question. Could it investigate the frequency, reliability and cost of Irish Sea ferry links?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>I take the Member&rsquo;s point regarding the comparison of rail speeds in Europe and in the British Isles. This is a detailed technical question that comes up most clearly when comparing the speeds achieved by Eurostar trains in France to the speeds that can be achieved in England. I think that the question simply relates to technical matters with regard to the track. We can look into that and perhaps get a more detailed answer.</p>
<p>At the British-Irish Council, we looked at the frequency of Irish Sea ferries. It is relevant to the question of obtaining a riverside berth on the Mersey. Obtaining such a berth would result in a reduction in turnaround time of about one-and- a-half hours. That would be quite significant in terms of assisting the frequency of sailings on the Irish Sea.</p>
<p>I should also state that obtaining a riverside berth on the Mersey would be of particular advantage in facilitating access to the rail network that links us, through the Channel Tunnel, to all parts of Europe. This would be of significant benefit to exporters in Northern Ireland as they would not only have a higher frequency of sailings but could then, through trans-shipment onto rail, link into a network going through the tunnel and addressing any destination in Europe.</p>

<p>I welcome the meetings that have taken place and the reports from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
<p>Last week we launched a consultation document on the regional transport strategy. A central theme in that document is the importance of quality public transport throughout Northern Ireland. In relation to the detailed transport programmes that are being drawn up between now and the next council meeting, will particular emphasis be put on public transport, in particular the improvement in public transport vis-√†-vis the railway network between, for example, Derry and Dublin? Will working parties be set up in relation to those particular areas so that the Assembly can be informed, on a systematic basis, of the work at hand?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>That is a very relevant question, given that transport is a vital lifeline supporting the economic and social fabric of the North of Ireland. That is why the First Minister and I tried to ensure that these sectoral meetings would take place. As the Member is aware, transport affects every part of life here and therefore it is critically important that we try to ensure, as far as possible, that we develop systems that can improve the lot of everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>In relation to the specific elements of the questions, there was considerable discussion on how the public transport sector would provide the service required &mdash; not just in the greater urban areas but throughout the North of Ireland, especially in rural areas. General transport between North and South was also discussed. I can assure the Member that the studies approved at the two sectoral meetings will centre on those issues, not least of which will be the rail factors that he referred to.</p>
<p>Everybody is aware that the Executive recently agreed to the publication of a rail safety Bill, which will provide new safety-focussed legislation on the operation of railways in Northern Ireland. The authorities in the South are also engaged in producing new safety legislation. Cross-border- services legislation facilitated in both jurisdictions needs to be compatible, and we must ensure that it goes forward in parallel.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90105" speakername="Mr Peter Robinson" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>Can the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister tell the House &mdash; in the light of section 23(2) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and several articles and schedules of Statutory Rule 481 of 1999 &mdash; how they propose to give effect in Northern Ireland to any agreement reached on 19 December?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>The Member has raised an interesting point. Of course, we expect the Minister for Regional Development to carry out his Pledge of Office. It is regrettable that he has not done so fully heretofore, but I am sure that he recognises that he is under a duty to do so. The Member will also bear in mind that some of the issues touched on at the BIC relate to work that is done in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>With regard to North/South and east-west transport links, we are at the terminus. We are particularly interested in developments in the other jurisdictions. Of course, a number of the financial matters that we dealt with fall within the responsibility of other Departments. Matters involving finance and legislation are clearly within the purview of the Executive. But what the Member really should have said was that he is going to encourage his Colleague to carry out his responsibilities and not shirk them.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90070" speakername="Mr Alex Maskey" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the statement by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the North/South Council meeting and British-Irish Council meeting in relation to transport. I think that it is very timely, particularly in light of the First Minister&rsquo;s last comment.</p>
<p>Given the controversy that arose at the weekend over whether Bairbre de Br√∫n would have been nominated by the First Minster for the forthcoming scheduled meeting of the British-Irish Council, I ask the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister whether that meeting was raised at the Executive meeting last Thursday. If so, was the question of Bairbre de Br√∫n&rsquo;s nomination dealt with? The reason why I am asking this, Mr Speaker &mdash; and I seek your indulgence &mdash; is that we have heard throughout this morning&rsquo;s statement of how important it is to have transport, and other matters relating to the Executive and Assembly, dealt with in both of the institutions. That is even in the first paragraph of the statement. The last part of the First Minister&rsquo;s response to Peter Robinson was that his own Minister should live up to his responsibilities. However, the First Minister is currently failing to do that in respect of the North/South Ministerial Council. It is important &mdash;</p>
</speech>

<p>Order. The Member is aware that questions on statements have to relate to the statement concerned. The Member has, in the course of his question, adverted to another sectoral BIC &mdash; reputed BIC &mdash; meeting and what may have happened at the Executive Committee. If the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister wish to make a response, I am quite content to call them to do so.</p>
<p>There is no requirement for them to make a response because the matter raised by the Member is tangential to the statement that has been made. They are not prohibited from responding, of course.</p>

<p>May I finish my question? It is very basic.</p>

<p>Are the statements consistent with the First Minister&rsquo;s refusal to nominate Sinn F√©in Ministers to any of these institutions?</p>

<p>Discussions at Executive level are confidential and the Member will be aware of that. Certainly, he would expect the First Minister and myself to respect that confidentiality in relation to the details of that plenary meeting of the British-Irish Council tomorrow.</p>
<p>The two Governments have taken a decision whereby &mdash; because of the ongoing negotiations &mdash; that plenary meeting will be postponed until a later date. The two Governments will be making an announcement to that effect this morning.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.18" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90092" speakername="Mr Sean Neeson" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>In both statements, reference was made to public/private partnerships in the rail network. What progress has been made in developing public/private partnerships in Northern Ireland? I would remind the First Minister that Richard Branson was paraded before us prior to the vote on the referendum.</p>
<p>As regards the British-Irish Council, were there any discussions concerning improvements of the road from Stranraer to Carlisle?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.19" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>As regards the latter point, the A75 (Stranraer-Carlisle) was mentioned. In particular, we mentioned that that road now bypasses all towns, except for two small villages, which are to be bypassed at a later date. The Scottish representative was not in a position to make a statement in regard to that matter, however, over the course of the last decade, there has been quite a considerable improvement to the A75. This has considerably reduced the journey time from Stranraer to the M6 at Carlisle.</p>
<p>The issue of public-private partnerships was discussed as it is of considerable interest to us. If we are to tackle transport investment and investment in other matters, we must look closely at public-private partnerships. This has been referred to in the Programme for Government. We have a limited experience of operating public-private partnerships. The experience in England is much greater. The discussion at the British-Irish Council involved ourselves and the Republic of Ireland representatives asking Lord Macdonald to make experience of operating these partnerships available to us, which he has agreed to do. That will enable us to take greater advantage more rapidly of public-private partnerships.</p>

<p>Why do the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister consider it important to tell us who represents the Irish Government at these affairs, and not tell us who represents Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey? I am not sure if the intention is to elevate the Irish region and diminish all other regions involved in the British-Irish Council. It is important &mdash; not simply because one is elevated and one is diminished on my paper &mdash; because Members ought to know the identities of those who they may wish to contact in relation to the subject matter being discussed. If Members are told the makeup of one group, they should be told the makeup in all cases.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.21" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90069" speakername="Mr Seamus Mallon" time="10:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>There is no intention to elevate one administration above another. Lest there be any doubt, Lord Macdonald represented the British Government. Mr Phillip Pain, director of the Isle of Man airport, represented the Isle of Man. Jersey was represented by Mr Colin Powell, adviser of air and shipping services, whilst Guernsey was represented by Deputy Michael Torode, vice president for the State of Guernsey transport board. All those details are in the Library, as I said earlier.</p>

<p>There has been mention recently in the media of the difficulty of pursuing driving offences from one jurisdiction in another. Did the meeting discuss a system for the transfer of penalty points for driving offences between jurisdictions, east-west or North/South?</p>
<p class="italic">The Deputy First Minister rose.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.3.23" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90113" speakername="Rt Hon David Trimble" time="11:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#3">
<p>The matter was discussed with great interest, and from our response you can see our eagerness on the issue.</p>
<p>This is a very serious point. The Irish representatives pointed out that a significant percentage of traffic accidents occur in the border region. There are a number of factors in that, but part of the reason is that people, when they cross the border, think that they can take greater risks because they are not going to be liable to penalties in the same way. For that reason, there is a clear need for some correspondence with regard to penalty points imposed in one jurisdiction applying in others. We also discussed the mutual recognition of disqualifications between jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A penalty point scheme was introduced in Northern Ireland in October 1997, and it has to be said that the majority of points imposed are for excessive speed. The Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions in London intend this year to bring forward legislative proposals for mutual recognition of penalty point offences between Northern Ireland and GB. That would extend to mutual recognition of disqualifications.</p>
<p>The Republic of Ireland intends to introduce a penalty point system from the end of 2001. There was discussion at NSMC and at BIC of the desirability of mutual recognition between North and South on these matters. Following the introduction of penalty points in the Republic of Ireland, the opportunity will exist to address the practicalities and the need for legislation for mutual recognition between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>In addition, of course, with the arrangement for mutual recognition between GB and Northern Ireland, there is then the prospect of having mutual recognition of points and disqualification throughout the British Isles. That is appropriate, because the whole of the British Isles is a common travel area. That is a very good reason for having a commonality in relation to road offences so as to protect the safety of other road users.</p>

<p>The new tourism board is actually a very important and crucial part of the arrangements in relation to North/South co-operation and in their implementation. Some time ago, the view was taken that the tourism board should be able to fulfil, on a wide scale, the type of functions that would increase the attraction of the island of Ireland and benefit tourism in the North of Ireland.</p>
<p>That underpinned the setting up of the new tourism board, which is now developing. I believe that it will be able to develop substantially and will deliver according to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s need for a fundamental development of tourism. A new chairman has been appointed. He comes from the North of Ireland and has vast experience in the tourism business. I believe that he will have the confidence of everyone, and I look forward to his contribution.</p>
<p>I assure the Member that this is one of the key areas for development. It is key to the economy. It is key to the development of the industry and it will be pursued vigorously.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the Member resorted to such phraseology at the end of his question. His premise is completely erroneous. As the Deputy First Minister stated, and as it has been trailed in some newspapers this morning, the British and Irish Governments have decided to postpone the plenary session of the British-Irish Council for a few weeks, because of ongoing political discussions. The view taken by the British and Irish Governments was that to hold a meeting would be a distraction in the context of those discussions. We hope that those discussions will result in significant progress in the implementation of the agreement. Therefore we see those developments &mdash; if they progress as we hope &mdash; as being part of the success of the agreement. I look forward to the Member being disappointed on this matter.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In December 1999 it was agreed that transport would be one of the six areas for enhanced co-operation. At that time it was welcomed as an item for discussion because of its impact on the environment and on those involved in transport and in the road and rail infrastructure. Can the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister indicate the reason for the delay in calling a North/South Ministerial Council meeting on transport until a year later?</p>

<p>This matter is one in which the Member is probably already well informed. There is no secret about the fact that the relevant Minister has consistently refused to participate in sectoral meetings in relation to that area agreed by the Assembly and to which the Pledge of Office applies. A decision then had to be taken on how to proceed, and it was that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister would start the process of involvement in sectoral meetings in relation to transport. In the circumstances, this was the type of approach that would find favour with all who wish to see the crucial issue of transport developed, not just within the Programme for Government but also the programme of relationships with our nearest neighbours &mdash; Britain and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p>Will the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister advise if the importance of the trans-European network is recognised by the British-Irish Council? In that context can they advise if there were, or are, plans to discuss the importance of upgrading the east Antrim rail link to Larne or upgrading the A8 road to Larne, to improve safety and reduce congestion? Is it recognised that these routes are important not only for us but for people in the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and the north of England?</p>

<p>We recognise the importance of trans-European networks and, as the Member has mentioned, that they have implications for some road links within Northern Ireland. At the meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council and the British- Irish Council we did not deal with those specific matters. At the NSMC meeting there was a discussion with reference to rail links, although not specifically the Larne link. Of course, in the context of the British-Irish Council, we are more concerned with the links from Northern Ireland across England to Europe. We therefore did not directly address the question of the A8 or the rail link to Larne. They are extremely important &mdash; the A8 in particular &mdash; but that discussion did not come up in the context of the British-Irish Council.</p>

<p>I welcome the statement particularly in relation to developing stronger North/South co-operation on roads development along the border from Newry to Derry. Can the First Minister and the Deputy First Minster confirm that the Minister for Regional Development did not take part in the North/South Ministerial Council? Can they inform the House in what way the same Minister has been involved in the Programme for Government, particularly in relation to infrastructure and roads development? The Minister said before Christmas that he would be willing to meet the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the Republic on the question of transport.</p>

<p>The answer to the Member&rsquo;s first question is self-explanatory &mdash; no, the relevant Minister did not take part in either the North/South Ministerial Council meeting or the British- Irish Council meeting. In relation to his second question, an office of the Special EU Programmes Body was opened in Omagh on 4 September 2000 in temporary premises in the Omagh District Council office. It will relocate to permanent premises shortly. The Omagh office will have overall responsibility for monitoring and promoting the implementation of the common chapter and will also be responsible for managing the cross-border priority of Peace II, including responsibility for grant making. It is a matter for each of the bodies concerned to decide on the premises to occupy, when to occupy them and how to administer them.</p>

<p>The Member makes the valid point that, prior to the existence of the North/South Ministerial Council, there were frequent bilateral meetings between Belfast and Dublin, and, indeed, formal agreements on joint operations. I recall, in particular, the joint agreement in relation to the operation of the rail link where, from 1953 for a number of years, a North/South group of civil servants ran the railways. Nobody got worried about North/South institutions and bodies, even though they were exercising executive functions in that context. What we have now in the North/South Ministerial Council is an opportunity to regularise those links and put them on a coherent basis. The Member is right to say that it could have been done on a bilateral basis, but we think that it is better done on a coherent basis. By asking that question, the Member is drawing attention to the absolute hypocrisy of the Minister who is prepared to engage in North/South activity on a bilateral basis but will not do so on a structured basis. There is no coherence in that position at all.</p>

I welcome the fact that meetings happened before Christmas, and I am particularly pleased to note a number of positive developments towards harmonisation nationally. Was the subject of free transport provision for senior citizens in the Six Counties discussed? Has any progress been made on this matter so that senior citizens can begin to benefit from the free transport from which senior citizens in the rest of Ireland have benefited for many years? Was there any specific recognition of the scope to develop the A5-N2 Derry-Dublin road through Strabane, Omagh, Aughnacloy and Monaghan &mdash; one of our key transportation corridors?</p>

<p>I have a more than passing interest in the provision of transport for senior citizens. The issue is included in the Programme for Government, and therefore it is a matter for the Executive and the Assembly. I firmly believe that it should be proceeded with very quickly because its absence is putting people, particularly those living in rural areas, at a disadvantage. Passing reference was made to the matter, but it should be regarded as a matter for the Assembly and the Executive as part of the strategic element of transport development.</p>
<p>On the subject of the Derry to Dublin road, there was a long discussion about two key elements in road development &mdash; major trunk roads and smaller roads, which are essential to people&rsquo;s everyday lives. Members will agree, however, that it would be wrong for Executive representatives at these sectoral meetings to focus on specific road links. There have been questions about the Larne link and the Derry to Dublin link. It is essential that all key trunk roads are dealt with efficiently and quickly, and that the lesser roads service is improved to the standard which people in border areas are entitled to expect.</p>

<p>I too welcome the statement on transport, planning and safety. Will the Deputy First Minister comment on the success, or otherwise, of the very hard- hitting Christmas and new-year drink/driving campaign? Can he comment on the co-operation and co-ordination between the two jurisdictions on this campaign? Can he also indicate what other measures they can take to reduce the awful death toll on our roads, North and South?</p>

<p>The measures identified by the First Minster in relation to the penalty points system are crucial. There has been a large degree of co-operation in the running of the road safety campaign. The anti- drink/driving advertising that was broadcast on television over Christmas made for harrowing viewing, but it was also very effective in that it brought home to everybody exactly what can happen when such an accident takes place.</p>
<p>We will try, through the studies agreed at the sectoral meetings, to develop measures that will ensure that road safety, and the specific element of drink/driving to which the Member referred, is dealt with on a cross-border basis so that there will be no easy passage, North or South, for those who break the law on road safety.</p>

<p>I note that the First Minister has expressed regret that the Minister for Regional Development, in line with his election commitment to oppose North- Southery, did not attend this meeting and will not be attending similar meetings because of the waste of resources involved. Can the First Minister assure the House that his ban on Sinn&nbsp;F√©in&rsquo;s attending similar meetings will continue, or is the sanction just the First Minister&rsquo;s being &quot;full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&quot;?</p>

<p>The Member&rsquo;s quotation from Shakespeare was, in my view, a little autobiographical on his part &mdash; but that is an entirely separate matter. It is inappropriate to describe the meetings that have taken place as a waste of resources. The cost of both sectoral meetings, at which representatives on transport interests from every jurisdiction in the British Isles met in Belfast, was ¬£4,500. The representatives established contacts and shared experiences.</p>
<p>It amounts to extremely good value for money that for so little we have had the opportunity to exchange information and arrange co-operation. I am sure that the measures will save considerable sums of money, benefit transport and save lives. I think that most people will recognise the silliness of the Member&rsquo;s point.</p>

<p>We have been told this morning that the members of the board of Tourism Ireland&nbsp;Ltd have been appointed, and the news has quite rightly been welcomed. Are the Ministers satisfied that the board boasts a broad base and can represent all aspects of tourism when developing international marketing strategy?</p>

<p>The larger the board, the greater the lack of cohesion. In many ways, the level of representation was determined by the agreed size of the board.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we are generally satisfied that the tourist industry in its widest sense is represented on the board. We are very pleased that those practitioners who have vast experience of dealing with tourism in the most difficult times in Northern Ireland are represented. We are also pleased that the board has been invested with excellent leaders. That is very important.</p>
<p>As the Member well knows, the functions of the board are crucial, and it will move very quickly on the planning, development and delivery of the marketing programmes. As with every other board, and with every other development, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I have no doubt that if we combine continuing peace with this type of integrated approach to developing tourism, the pudding will include the practical results that we want.</p>

<p>I want to ask the First Minister about the British/Irish Council meeting. Will he indicate whether discussions have taken place on the need for a special fund for the modernisation of the road structure in Northern Ireland, or does he intend that they should take place with the ministerial representative from Whitehall?</p>
<p>I ask this question in view of the drastic neglect of the roads infrastructure in Northern Ireland over the past 26&nbsp;years of direct rule and the cumulative and disastrous effect of underfunding over that period. I envisage a special modernisation fund in the form of a one-off payment to compensate for that underfunding and neglect.</p>

<p>This question of funding is more properly a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It involves general issues about the structure of the block grant and how it is dispersed. It was not raised directly at the British/Irish Council meeting, but of course the question of the funding of Northern Ireland programmes in general is a matter with which we are very much concerned. It happens that the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister and I will have a meeting with the Chancellor of Exchequer on Wednesday morning. That meeting is directed mainly towards the particular tax problems we have with regard to the fuel cost differential between ourselves and the Republic of Ireland; it is partly a tax issue and partly also a currency issue. We plan to raise some other tax issues with him as well, but we are always conscious of the opportunity on these occasions to raise all issues relating to what is called the Barnett formula.</p>
<p>In raising these issues, we have to bear in mind that public expenditure in Northern Ireland is significantly above the UK average. Underfunding of transport, like underfunding of other areas, is a matter of how decisions have been made in the past with regard to allocations within the Northern Ireland block.</p>
<p>When we deal with expenditure and ask for more, we must bear in mind however that we are being treated extremely generously at the moment. We will still ask for more because we believe that some areas have greater needs, one of which is the need for investment infrastructure. In view of the generous provision of public expenditure in Northern Ireland, we need to proceed diplomatically.</p>

<p>I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he wishes to make a statement on the outcome of the December monitoring.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" speakeroffice="The Minister of Finance and Personnel" time="11:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the Executive&rsquo;s decisions on the December monitoring round.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 18 January the Executive decided on some reallocations of expenditure for the short time remaining in the current financial year. These reallocations make use of the resources available from changes in Departments&rsquo; estimated requirements, which became available in the December monitoring round. As I explained in my statement on the October monitoring round, the focus is on changes to estimated requirements and the fine-tuning of allocations rather than on any new advances through policy change or new priorities. The Programme for Government still guides our prioritisation of the allocations, but at this stage of the year the process is based on what is possible and necessary in this financial year.</p>
<p>The December monitoring round completes the process of considering what revisions might be necessary to estimates provision. The process for the passage of the next Appropriation Bill, which addresses the spring supplementary estimates for all Departments, has to begin now. Thus the issues addressed in this monitoring round will be the last which can be reflected in supplementary estimates for this financial year.</p>
<p>Last week the Executive decided that the agreement of the Assembly should be sought to a modification of Standing Orders to ensure that accelerated passage for Appropriation Bills is recognised as routine and essential. Last autumn I discussed this fully with the Committee for Finance and Personnel, and I am very grateful for its having signalled that it would be content for this to happen, subject to appropriate consultation on the public expenditure plans. I acknowledge that this year the extent of involvement and consultation with the Committee for Finance and Personnel and the Assembly on the Budget cycle has been constrained. In relation to the spring supplementary estimates, I hope that the details I am providing today and further discussion with the Committee will be helpful to all concerned as background to the next Appropriation Bill, which will be introduced in mid-February. That will draw together all revisions to public expenditure allocations subsequent to the main estimates that we passed in June. Thus it will draw together the June monitoring round, the Agenda for Government, the changes to departmental running costs that were agreed by the Executive in July and the October and December monitoring rounds.</p>
<p>Turning to details of this monitoring round, the amount available for reallocation is ¬£67¬∑7 million. Once again, there are unique reasons for the figure being so high at this stage of the financial year. We did not expect to have a substantial amount, but several factors have yielded substantial resources for reallocation. The amount available through revised estimates of departmental requirements is ¬£35&nbsp;million, of which some ¬£11 million is from additional receipts, either from fees and charges or from disposals of assets. At this stage of the year minor changes to these items always come from Departments. The amount is increased because the revision in the treatment of rate rebates that provided some additional spending power in 2001-02 and later years, as was explained in the Budget that was laid before the Assembly on 12 December 2000, also applies to 2000-01.</p>
<p>Members will be aware also that because of the suspension last year, the full Budget allocated for the Assembly Commission this time last year will not be needed in this financial year. The Executive recognise the need to consider carefully the need for more office accommodation, which may mean that there will be additional requirements in 2001-02 or later years for the Assembly.</p>
<p>However, when the underspend from the Assembly this year is taken into account, there may not be a need for any net increase in the Assembly&rsquo;s costs, taking the several years together. That position is still highly uncertain, given the need to explore accommodation options for additional Assembly staff. The Executive are happy to work further with the Assembly to ensure that the needs are facilitated and addressed, showing the due regard for economy and effectiveness that the Assembly requires in respect of all public expenditure.</p>
<p>Thus, making use of some of the forecasted underspending from the Assembly&rsquo;s Budget for 2000-01 does not undermine the Assembly Commission&rsquo;s plans: the funding of our needs can be addressed fully in 2001-02, if necessary through the end of year flexibility arrangements.</p>
<p>The ¬£67¬∑7&nbsp;million available for reallocation comprises Departments&rsquo; estimated underspending, the revised approach to rate rebates and the amount the Assembly does not directly require for this financial year. The Executive&rsquo;s proposals for the use of these resources take account of the bids from Departments, the need to retain flexibility to address the Assembly&rsquo;s needs and the major question of the Health Service&rsquo;s trusts&rsquo; deficits.</p>
<p>Departmental bids for additional spending in this financial year amounted to some ¬£50¬∑4&nbsp;million, excluding the matter of the Health Service&rsquo;s trusts&rsquo; deficits. Given the substantial amounts available, the Executive have decided to meet a large proportion of those bids, totalling some ¬£39¬∑8&nbsp;million. It is not surprising that the bids are smaller than would be the case at other stages since only a few months remain in which to make further spending this year. I will say a little about the additional allocations for each Department.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will receive an additional ¬£2&nbsp;million, mainly for the fine-tuning of disease compensation payment requirements and the cost of assistance schemes and a science service. For the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, a total of ¬£0¬∑9&nbsp;million is available for several key aspects of the Department&rsquo;s activities, including museums, the Northern Ireland Millennium Company, sport and other services. While no bids were received from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, its needs in relation to assistance to industry will be kept under review for the remainder of the financial year to ensure that all needs are addressed.</p>
<p>The Department of Education receives ¬£2¬∑6&nbsp;million, including provision for the Irish-medium trust fund. The Department of Finance and Personnel receives ¬£0¬∑8&nbsp;million for the fine-tuning of estimates of administrative costs. The Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment receives ¬£0¬∑3&nbsp;million, again for the fine-tuning of expenditure for European Community initiatives and for the administration of student awards by the education and library boards.</p>
<p>The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety made a substantially larger bid. Leaving aside the question of the Health Service&rsquo;s trusts&rsquo; deficits, which I will come to shortly, the Executive have decided to allocate ¬£14¬∑5&nbsp;million to address a range of needs in the Health Service. That includes ¬£3&nbsp;million for the fine-tuning of estimates for capital expenditure, ¬£3&nbsp;million for winter pressures and community care, ¬£1¬∑2&nbsp;million for pressure on the acute hospitals, and ¬£1¬∑3&nbsp;million to improve premises used by general practitioners.</p>
<p>An additional ¬£1&nbsp;million will be made available to the Department of the Environment, including ¬£600,000 for historic buildings grants and an amount for planning compensation. For the Department for Regional Development, it has been necessary to add ¬£5&nbsp;million to the Budget because of a delay in the disposal of assets by the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company (NITHC). In essence, that is a rephrasing of a receipt, and thus the proposal, as agreed by the Minister for Regional Development, is that the increase now made for 2000-01 should be offset by a corresponding decrease in 2001-02 when additional receipts will be available from that disposal of assets. The changes do not affect the spending power of the Department for Regional Development and, therefore, make good sense as straightforward aspects of financial management. There would be no need for such fine tuning if the asset disposals had been managed as planned at the outset of the year. The Executive hope that that will be the case in the future, so that there is less need for the adjustment of spending allocations.</p>
<p>In addition to that ¬£5 million, further moneys have been allocated to the Department for Regional Development, including ¬£4 million for structural maintenance on the roads, and ¬£1¬∑5 million for equipment and minor works in the Water Service. In total, the proposed additional allocation to the Department for Regional Development is ¬£14 million.</p>
<p>For the Department for Social Development, there is an additional ¬£3¬∑5 million, including ¬£2 million to deal with fuel poverty, a matter that I know to be of concern to Members from all parties. There is also an additional ¬£1 million for the regeneration of housing in north Belfast and ¬£0¬∑5 million to make up for some of the rental income lost by the Housing Executive as a result of the extensive programme of house sales.</p>
<p>Finally, an additional ¬£0¬∑1 million has been allocated to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to meet the costs associated with President Clinton&rsquo;s visit before Christmas.</p>
<p>Largely, the allocations represent the fine tuning of the estimated requirements of Departments. They are routine allocations, moving resources from where they are no longer needed to the emerging pressure points in the Executive&rsquo;s Budget.</p>
<p>The Executive have also considered carefully the difficulties facing the Health Service, which have left an increasing number of health service trusts facing deficits. Financial arrangements in the Health Service still reflect the internal market and include the possibility that individual trusts will have surpluses or deficits that will balance out over several years. Thus, the existence of deficits is not, in itself, a critical difficulty. However, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has indicated that deficits have been increasing materially, which represents a growing problem for the Health Service. The Executive recognise the serious pressure facing the Health Service and the difficulty of finding adequate additional resources for services, mainly caused by the fact that we are not getting sufficient resources from the Barnett formula. The Barnett formula amounts that we receive, when additional funding is provided for the Health Service in England, do not meet our needs proportionately. We will need to take that issue further with the Treasury, as part of our work on the Barnett formula. The Committee for Finance and Personnel has recommended that approach, and the issue has been discussed extensively in this House in the context of next year&rsquo;s Budget.</p>
<p>The Executive are also concerned to ensure that the management of resources provided by the Assembly for the Health Service is consistent with control requirements. That is important to the Assembly as a whole and to the Public Accounts Committee in particular. We must ensure that the problems that face the Health Service are dealt with following the procedures for financial management and control required by the Assembly. My Department, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will consider the issue of trust deficits in detail in the coming weeks, to ensure that we fully understand the complex financial arrangements and their implications, and to allow appropriate action to be taken.</p>
<p>Substantial resources are available to us, even after we have met a large proportion of the bids from Departments. It is necessary, of course, to consider what additional help we should provide to the Health Service this time. We must also consider the implications of the deficits for future patterns of activity in the Health Service. The Executive have therefore concluded that they are not yet ready to decide exactly how to handle the issue in the remainder of this financial year. Some further details are being investigated to ensure there is a clearer picture. When that has been completed, the Executive will set out its proposed approach to the Assembly.</p>
<p>This monitoring round has provided some significant adjustments to expenditure patterns in this financial year. However, I stress again that these are routine adjustments, mainly driven by revised estimates of requirements, both up and down, across a very wide range of services. This is to be expected at this stage of the year, and I do not want to give the impression that there were significant choices to be made in this monitoring round given the limited scope for change in any action at this late stage of the financial year.</p>
<p>I will be happy to discuss the issues arising further, especially with the Finance and Personnel Committee, so that the background is fully covered as necessary before the spring supplementary estimates are introduced next month. The Executive will also address further the question of health service trust deficits and bring its conclusions to the Assembly as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. First, I thank the Minister for the statement, which at least shows the very healthy state of the Budget, if not of the Health Service. The ¬£67 million recouped for reallocation is a substantial amount of money. It is very prudent of the Minister to be able to recoup that amount for reallocation.</p>
<p>The Minister mentions the issue of the rate rebate revisions in the statement. Can he explain further how that affects the amount of spending that is available for us in this particular end of year monitoring round? Will it leave us in a situation where he can actually reconsider next year&rsquo;s 8% rise in the rates? There has been a substantial amount of underspending in the past year and that amount could be offset against the ¬£12 million that the 8% rise will realise. That rise could then be brought into line with inflation. I know that the Minister will want to do that if possible.</p>
<p>Taking on board the Finance and Personnel Committee&rsquo;s recommendations on the Barnett formula, it is important to know how the Minister proposes to tackle that issue. Maybe he will clarify that for us. We have not been getting a fair allocation under the Barnett formula for spending in the Health Service, in particular, compared with England. We need to achieve equality. Can the Minister clarify that?</p>

<p>Before calling the Minister, I want to point out that this is not an opportunity to raise broad questions about the principles of finance in the Northern Ireland Budget. It is an opportunity to ask questions on the December monitoring proposals.</p>

<p>I thank the Chairperson for his remarks and questions.</p>
<p>First, we need to build a strong case concerning the Barnett formula and we need to make representation in time for the next spending review.</p>
<p>As the First Minister indicated in response to previous questions, this is a matter not just for myself, as the Minister of Finance and Personnel, but for the Executive as a whole. The representational role of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is going to be key in this particular exercise.</p>
<p>We are trying to build up the type of case that will need to be made. We also need to anticipate the argument that is likely to be made against our case. That is why there are a number of issues that we need to address.</p>
<p>The Chairperson also raised the question of the rate rebate treatment. We covered this in the Budget statement and in the Budget document. There are changes, as approved and agreed by the Treasury, in the treatment of rate rebates, which now come under the departmental expenditure limit (DEL). That has applied this year, and that is why we have additional money available. The rate rebate factor has already been factored into next year&rsquo;s Budget. It would not be appropriate to carry money from this year&rsquo;s rate rebate and set it against next year&rsquo;s Budget. That is not the basis on which we can plan budgets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rate increase that we have indicated looks like being the increase that we are going to have to adopt &mdash; subject to some final figures being available. It is simply to meet expenditure planned for next year and subsequent years. Notwithstanding the money that has become available in this monitoring round, nobody has yet said to me that there is money in our spending plans that is not required and could be used to allow a lower rate increase.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that trusts have managed to spend more than their budgeted income by delaying the payment of bills to suppliers. If deficits have been financed by trade credit, the latest annual deficits must represent the total deficit. In view of the annual budgetary arrangements, is it sensible to accumulate the annual deficits over a number of years? What is the total overspend?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>First, trusts operate under financial arrangements that allow them to run deficits in given years. However, the trusts are required to balance their finances over a period of time, perhaps three to five years. There has been no breach of the financial controls. Obviously, the situation will be different when resource accounting is adopted; deficits will no longer be separate from departmental expenditure limits.</p>
<p>The Department of Finance and Personnel, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister need to identify any problems suggested by the pattern of the deficits. The Member suggested that some deficits were caused by delaying payment of suppliers&rsquo; bills. Such issues must be explored in a manner that is sensitive to the pressures that are contributing to the trusts&rsquo; problems. Financial management and control issues must also be examined.</p>

<p>Health trust deficits are a serious and complex matter. I appreciate, therefore, that the issue needs further examination before any conclusive statement can be made. However, the matter is urgent, and the Assembly needs to know that the matters will be addressed within a definite and tight timetable. On behalf of the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee, I register with the Minister our concerns and our desire to be fully informed on the background of the problems and on any planned remedial action.</p>

<p>I recognise the urgency of the situation, but we must face up to its complexity. The Executive were unable to take conclusive decisions at this stage, without gathering further information. Obviously, we must reach firm conclusions in time to allow us to make decisions about financial allocations in this financial year, if the Executive consider that that is the best way forward.</p>
<p>The current arrangements are complex, and we need a little time to reflect on the most appropriate way forward. I expect that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will ensure that the departmental Committee is kept fully informed about all developments.</p>

<p>Did the Minister take any cognisance of the plea made by traders and small businesses to the Assembly last week to reconsider the increase in the regional rate, which is to be almost three times the rate of inflation? When will the Minister and the parties in the Executive that support him take on board the fact that it is scandalous to raise the regional rate by 8%? It is especially scandalous in view of previous commitments made by members of the Minister&rsquo;s own party when they sat on local councils. He can take it from me that householders, small traders and businesses will draw very little comfort from his statement today in relation to the issue of the regional rate.</p>
<p>The Minister mentioned an overall amount of ¬£67¬∑7 million being made available for reallocation. He said that ¬£35 million came from revised estimates of requirements by Departments. Can he give us some more details on which Departments have given up what amounts of money, rather than just a global sum? He said that of that ¬£35 million, ¬£11 million is additional receipts. Can he confirm that some of those receipts come from the sale of Housing Executive homes? Will he take on board the point that has been made by many Members in the House about the need to address chronic housing need in Northern Ireland, especially in areas like north Belfast? Will he accept that to continue to draw money out of the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s budget in this way, and not to return a proportionate amount, is unacceptable?</p>
<p>Finally, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement today of ¬£1 million extra funding for the regeneration of housing in north Belfast. I am pleased to have received a letter from the Minister for Social Development, indicating that thus far ¬£4¬∑5 million has been allocated. This extra ¬£1 million will be of enormous assistance and benefit to our work in regenerating run-down areas in north Belfast.</p>
<p>I also welcome the ¬£2 million towards alleviating the problem of fuel poverty. I ask the Minister to continue with the work that he is doing &mdash;</p>

<p>Order. The Member has put quite a number of questions to the Minister.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.12" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I thank the Member for his many questions.</p>
<p>First, on the question of rates, the Member knows that the December monitoring round has nothing to do with the budgeted rate increases for next year. This is an adjustment to this year&rsquo;s allocations, and it does not relate to our revenue needs in terms of allocations for next year or future years. It has nothing to do with the rate increase at this point.</p>
<p>As I have already said, we will be finalising the determination in relation to the rates next year, subject to further figures being available. The Executive have heard, and are alert to, a lot of the concerns, frustrations and misgivings that have been expressed about rate increases. Nevertheless, we have made clear the basis on which the decisions have been taken.</p>
<p>The point has been made about those parties who sit on the Executive and agree with this. Again I say that whenever we were going through the papers on the Budget &mdash; and papers were fully circulated, including recommendations on options on rate increases &mdash; no Minister of any party specifically opposed the rate increases that were proposed. I want to make that clear again, because the point seems to have been lost.</p>
<p>Concerning where the money has come from, obviously there are some small adjustments. Of the significant amounts, there is some ¬£7 million from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment; that basically is money that was being held there in support of possible bids in relation to Harland &amp; Wolff. A further ¬£3 million has come in from house sales. I have never made a secret of the fact that there are significant receipts coming in from house sales. Indeed, I referred to it in my statement. There is ¬£2¬∑5 million in Water Service receipts, ¬£6 million from the old round of EU programmes and ¬£1¬∑4 million from LEDU.</p>
<p>The Member made a point about the Department for Social Development and housing receipts. The Department for Social Development&rsquo;s bids in this monitoring round have been met. There seems to be a suggestion that we should be allocating more than has actually been bid for. As I have said before, we cannot adopt a position that says that receipts automatically lie where they fall, because not all Departments and programmes are in a position to generate receipts.</p>
<p>I am pleased that the Member welcomes the additional money for the north Belfast strategy.</p>
<p>That additional ¬£1 million follows the additional ¬£2 million that was allocated in the revised Budget in December.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.13" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90023" speakername="Mr Seamus Close" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>Does the Minister agree that in situations such as this it would be advantageous and in the interest of the Assembly if the final figures were brought to the attention of the respective Statutory Committees before they are brought before the Executive? That would enable Members to have an input into the reallocation of those easements. Otherwise the Executive announce figures and almost create a &quot;them and us&quot; situation where they do their thing and the rest of us follow. That is not in the interests of democracy or the Assembly. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>
<p>Paragraph 16 of the Minister&rsquo;s statement states that the allocations are from resources that were &quot;no longer needed&quot;. The figures from the October monitoring round and the December monitoring round amount to ¬£143 million &mdash; approximately 2% of the overall Budget. Does the Minister agree that that clearly demonstrates that there is an in-built fat content of ¬£143 million in the budgeting mechanisms? In view of that, the ¬£143 million could have been reallocated for future years &mdash; for example, 2001-02 &mdash; thus keeping the regional rate below inflation. That would assist Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy by protecting its backbone &mdash; the small traders.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to say that we cannot look to the revenue for future years when we are dealing with reallocations. It is part and parcel of the budgeting exercise, and where there is fat, it is the Assembly&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that it does not exist in future years.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.14" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>When we say that money is not needed, we do not mean that it is not needed for public expenditure, rather that it is not needed against the budgeted item for this year. It may be because there has been a change in circumstances and the need is not the same, or it may be because there has been a slippage in spending, and the money cannot be spent on that issue in this financial year but can be spent on the same need in future years. Therefore we are not saying that the money is not needed.</p>
<p>The Member&rsquo;s argument suggests that Northern Ireland can afford to have a lower level of public expenditure. With regard to the Barnett formula, most people argue that Northern Ireland needs more public expenditure. That is an argument that the Member and his party have made. However, there now appears to be a suggestion that Northern Ireland can afford less public expenditure.</p>
<p>Adjusting moneys in the monitoring rounds justifies the use of monitoring rounds. Nobody pretends that we get estimates right or that things always go according to plan. Therefore monitoring rounds are used to ensure that we get the best use out of moneys in-year.</p>
<p>This money is needed. Proof of that is in its allocation to pressing needs, needs that, it is hoped, Members will welcome. There are also outstanding needs in the Health Service. Therefore the money is required this year and, as I am sure all Members will agree, we will need more public expenditure next year and in the years beyond.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90086" speakername="Prof Monica McWilliams" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I agree with Seamus Close. It would be useful if Committees received advance note of the detail of the Minister&rsquo;s statement. However, I welcome the statement. I am concerned about the trusts that are in deficit, and I add my concern to that of Rev Robert Coulter&rsquo;s. Health bodies that are in deficit are: the North and West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust; Altnagelvin Area Hospital; Sperrin Lakeland Trust; Ulster Community and Hospital Health and Social Services Trust; Armagh and Dungannon Health and Social Services Trust; Causeway Health and Social Services Trust; Homefirst Community Trust; United Hospitals Health and Social Services Trust; Greenpark Healthcare Trust; Belfast City Hospital; Craigavon Area Hospital; and the Royal Group of Hospitals.</p>
<p>What happens to those trusts with regard to penalties? Are there incentives for other trusts not named on the list?</p>
<p class="italic">12.00</p>
<p>Will the Minister also tell us where the finance will be found for the very expensive judicial reviews that are being taken by Departments against Departments? Will that finance now have to be found out of the ¬£17¬∑3&nbsp;million that is not currently allocated?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.16" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>Departments meet legal costs out of their budgets.</p>
<p>On the wider point about trust deficits, I recognise that many people will consider some trusts to be in significant deficit, while others have stayed within budget and reported surpluses. We need to look at all the issues involved. It is not a case of drawing up blacklists or penalty lists. We need to deal with this problem in all its aspects, which are manifold. We need to look at where pressures on trusts, particularly trusts providing acute services, are giving rise to this problem. We need to look at the wider issues of funding, and we also need to look at the management and control questions. The Executive, the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Office of the First&nbsp;Minister and the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister are agreed that we need to approach this from the point of view of accountability for service, care, spending and control. This is not just an accountancy exercise; it is an exercise in accountability for services provided and expenditure managed. It would be premature for me to speculate on any particular issue to do with any particular trust.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to respond to Mr&nbsp;Close&rsquo;s point about Committees. The Department of Finance and Personnel receives bids from Departments in monitoring rounds. We explore the issues that are involved in those bids with the Departments. We also receive notification of easements of money from Departments that feel that they will not be able to spend what they have been allocated. We manage the process by making recommendations to the Executive, and the Executive make the decisions. It is up to other Departments and Ministers to decide the level of consultation or information exchange they have with their Committees.</p>

<p>The Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee has been concerned for some time about the visibility of NHS funds and the fact that there seems to be enormous difficulty in identifying where the funds go when they leave the boards. Why have the Department of Finance and Personnel and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety not been more curious before now as to why a detailed monitoring system has not been in place for identifying the destination of the ¬£2¬∑3&nbsp;billion that leaves the former Department and goes to the latter? Where does it go, and what is it used for?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.19" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>The budget for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is significant, as has been mentioned in the statement and in response to other questions. There are complex financial arrangements involved, and we now want to review those. The Minister has already said that some aspects of Health Service structures and systems will be looked at. The Department of Finance and Personnel and the economic policy unit in the Office of the First&nbsp;Minister and the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister want to see more streamlined arrangements, so that it is much easier literally to follow the money. The move to resource accounting and budgeting is one change in the overall system that should contribute to that. That will have an impact on the Health Service as well as on all other aspects of the public sector. It should also make it easier to trace money, to detect problems as they emerge and to require people to alert us to problems as they emerge.</p>
<p>Regarding the particular pressing points on the current deficits, my officials only became aware of their acuteness in the context of this particular monitoring round. The Executive now recognise that this is an issue which, for a number of reasons, we need to address now. However, we need to address it in light of fuller information on all of the factors, rather than just making a reflex allocation now. There are wider issues, including some of the questions that the Member touched upon, that need to be examined.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasChann Comhairle. I welcome the statement, particularly the allocation of extra funding to health. The fact that the Minister gave seven paragraphs to health is also welcome. On the question of accountability, I refer to page 6 in relation to the Department for Regional Development:</p>
<p class="small">&quot;There would not be a need for these fine tuning changes if the asset disposals were managed as planned at the outset of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Does this indicate a mismanagement ethos within the Department for Regional Development?</p>
<p>We all welcome monitoring of spends, and I notice ¬£14 million being given to the Department for Regional Development and ¬£14¬∑5 to health. It seems from that that if you are outside the loop, you get much better treatment. In addition, what measures of accountability does the Minister have in place for those who are outside the loop, regarding where they spend their money, how they spend it, and what areas they spend it in?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.21" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I hope that in future these statements will not be judged on how many paragraphs people get &mdash; although it might be easier, particularly for me, to give people paragraphs rather than money. I will bear that in mind. There will be compensating paragraphs for those who are not quite so successful when it comes to bids.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, all Departments are in the loop in terms of public expenditure. That is also the position taken by the Department of Finance and Personnel and by the Executive. In agreeing these allocations, the Executive are discharging their responsibility. It is not just for Ministers to have regard for the needs of their own Departments, but also to have regard for the needs of the total public services, including public services administered by the Department for Regional Development and the Department for Social Development.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of people being advantaged by being either inside or outside the loop. That is a mistaken and superficial approach, not unlike the rather crass approach that Ian Paisley Jnr took earlier when trying to look at it in terms of Nationalist Ministers and Unionist Ministers. We have responded to need. Bids have been made by Departments and we, as an Executive, have responded to those bids as we have seen fit to do in the circumstances.</p>
<p>The point about the ¬£5 million obviously relates to the Hi-Park Centre. It had been anticipated that the transport holding company would sell Hi-Park this year, raising about ¬£5 million. That was the basis on which the Department for Regional Development budget was predicated. Obviously, that has not happened. We do not take that lightly. That ¬£5 million has been made good now on the understanding that it will come back to us in a revision of the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s budget for asset sales next year. That is working out in those terms precisely because Departments need to uphold the terms and the premises on which their budget has been allocated.</p>

<p>On the subject of health trust deficits, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s indication of a possible role for the Public Accounts Committee. Will he support increased powers for the Comptroller and Auditor General so that health trusts can be brought before the Public Accounts Committee to explain their overspending, their consistent failure to meet targets and their plans to put things right?</p>

<p>As I have said, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed. At this stage I think it would be wrong for me to focus on any one aspect of the issues that we need to pick up. The questions that have been raised in relation to audit and the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General are wider questions than pertain with this particular monitoring round.</p>
<p>The Member is aware that in the context, both of the Government Resources and Accounts Bill and of work on the pending audit reorganisation Bill, we are looking at ways of adding to the scope and access of the Comptroller and Auditor General on behalf of the Assembly. However, there is nothing in particular that I can add at this stage in the context of this monitoring round statement.</p>

<p>I welcome the additional ¬£600,000 for historic buildings grants, as that will lever more money from the heritage lottery fund for Northern Ireland. How much money is being spent on planning compensation? How much money has been set aside for the Irish-medium education trust fund? Given the state of school buildings in the controlled sector, there is a lot of concern in my community that money is being awarded to the Minister&rsquo;s pet projects while schools are falling down around children.</p>
<p>Did the Minister receive a request from the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister for ¬£120,000 for victims? Would that money not have been better allocated than the ¬£100,000 to the President&rsquo;s last-minute trip over to the Province to try and get some concession for his foreign policy, which has failed everywhere else?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.25" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I am glad that the Member welcomes the ¬£600,000 for buildings and heritage. As for his specific question on planning compensation, it is ¬£293,000. That is to meet legally binding settlements for planning compensation that could not be met within the existing budget.</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation in the Department of Education, in particular the question of the Irish-medium trust fund, ¬£750,000 is being allocated there. Obviously that is in response to the needs of that particular sector, and those bids, like other bids, have been assessed by the relevant Department and by ourselves. The Executive have seen fit to meet those bids. Bids have also been received in the past, and met, in the context of budget and other monitoring rounds, in relation to other sectors in education and to the wider school estate.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.26" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90101" speakername="Ms Sue Ramsey" time="11:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>In response to Monica McWilliams&rsquo;s question on trust deficits, the Minister said that it had to be dealt with within the context of financial control and management. I am a bit disappointed that the needs of the people did not come into play there. We need to ensure that the needs of the people come into play because there are different needs across different trusts.</p>
<p>On the issue of the additional money to Departments, the total amount, according to the statement, is ¬£67¬∑7 million, but in the allocation it is ¬£39¬∑7 million. That is a shortfall of ¬£28 million. What will happen to the rest of that money? I am concerned that there is no additional money in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Will this money be used to prop up shipbuilding, as has been done in the past? In total, how much has been given to the regeneration of north Belfast lately?</p>

<p>I thank the Member for her questions. I made it clear in my statement, and in my responses to questions, that there are a number of issues that need to be addressed regarding trusts. I have talked about being sensitive to the pressures that are facing trusts, particularly those providing acute services. I do not think it is fair for the Member to imply that any exercise that is now being carried out on behalf of the Executive will be blind to the needs that are there. We are taking this exercise forward in ways that will be sensitive, realistic, and responsive &mdash; where we can be &mdash; to needs, but we also have to regard our own financial control and management requirements. That is a responsibility I have to this Assembly.</p>
<p>I have said that we want to look at all of the issues involved, and that is why we are taking more time on this. I want to reassure the Member and the House generally on that point.</p>
<p>The allocation of ¬£1 million to north Belfast is in addition to the ¬£2 million allocated to the north Belfast regeneration effort in the revised budget that I announced in December. These two announcements mean a total contribution of ¬£3 million to that strategy.</p>
<p>We have detailed the amount of money available as ¬£67¬∑7 million; we are allocating ¬£40 million. We have said, on behalf of the Executive, that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department of Finance and Personnel and the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister are going to look into the issue of trust deficits, and we will make recommendations on allocations to the Assembly if that is what the Executive see fit to do. Obviously that is relevant to the money not allocated in today&rsquo;s statement. So too are other possible uses for money allocated into Executive programme funds for future use.</p>

<p>I welcome the additional ¬£5 million that has been allocated as a capital grant to railways. Will the Minister further outline exactly what that large amount of money will be spent on? Can he let the House know when each of the Roads Service divisions can expect to hear its additional allocation from the ¬£4 million earmarked for road maintenance? Will the Minister highlight the allocations that have been made in health that reflect expenditure or deficits that have already occurred? Can he further advise what additional money has been targeted on bed blocking and the associated inefficiencies related to this? Will he ensure that a better balance of funding in the health sector will occur in the future?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.29" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>The capital funding for the railways is essentially the money from the Hi-Park Centre. Members are well aware of the case that has been made regarding railway need, not least on the capital side, so this is part of a response to that. The ¬£5 million that I mentioned in response to an earlier question is being allocated to that particular end.</p>
<p>The Department has allocated ¬£4 million towards structural maintenance. Members are aware that there is a significant backlog in structural maintenance, so this is aimed at reducing this problem.</p>
<p>There is also the point of oil-related pressures. Roads Service uses oil-related products, such as asphalt and bitumen, so that puts a particular burden on its budget. Again, this is extra funding to try to mitigate those extra pressures. The Member also touched upon the issue of bed blocking with regard to the health budget. The Minister announced last year, in the context of winter pressures, several significant reviews into the different causes and contributing factors to many of the pressures which manifest themselves, particularly in the winter, but which are not always easily described as merely winter pressures. Those include the issue of bed blocking. We have responded to a number of bids from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and we are giving consideration to the outstanding points in relation to deficits.</p>

<p>I welcome the ¬£1&nbsp;million allocation to the north Belfast housing strategy, which, combined with the ¬£2&nbsp;million from the last monitoring round, will contribute greatly to the most pressing housing need in all of Northern Ireland. Had it not been for the dilatory and inept manner in which the Minister for Social Development has dealt with this issue &mdash; or rather has not dealt with it &mdash; and his lack of diligence in highlighting this as an urgent housing need, these topping-up allocations would not be necessary. Does the Minister agree that it is the Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s lack of commitment which has necessitated this matter&rsquo;s being brought to the Assembly today?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.31" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I thank the Member for his welcoming of the additional money, which means in total a further ¬£3&nbsp;million to the north Belfast housing strategy. That is not the only money going into the north Belfast regeneration scheme. Other money is going in from the Housing Executive and from the Department for Social Development budget. I hope that these top-ups are not regarded as second-rate money and that they will go as far and be spent as effectively as any other money. A bid has been received from the Department for Social Development, and we have been able to meet it in this context. It would be inappropriate for me to comment any further along the lines that the Member has requested. I find that all Ministers deal with me and my Department in a straightforward manner. I hope that my Department and I deal with them in a straightforward way in return. That applies in this Chamber and anywhere else.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.32" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90105" speakername="Mr Peter Robinson" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>Can the Minister confirm that he considers his Colleague&rsquo;s remarks to be petty, party political rubbish? First of all, how can he attack a Minister who put in a bid for funding, considering it to be urgent, for not taking the matter seriously? Secondly, pursuant to the reply that he gave to Monica&nbsp;McWilliams with regard to the legal cases that Ministers are taking against each other, what is the size of this ministerial wrangling fund that he has? How much does he expect will be spent by Ministers taking each other to court so that we may assess what good could have been done for Northern Ireland if they had not decided to do so?</p>
<p>Can the Minister also indicate, in relation to the regional rate, what degree of fiscal flexibility he has? Is it possible for him to carry money forward from one financial year to the next, considering this is a relatively small amount of money in relation to his overall Budget? That is one possible way for the Minister to reduce the impact that businesses in Northern Ireland will have as a result of his significant hike in the rates.</p>
<p>As has been indicated, about ¬£150 million is reallocated every year. Ten million pounds is all that is required to maintain the regional rate at the level of inflation. Surely the Minister recognises that during the course of the next financial year he will be making statements similar to today&rsquo;s, and he could very easily have absorbed the regional rate increase by allowing that on this occasion.</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to the Department for Regional Development, he has indicated ¬£5 million pounds for the sale of capital assets. Does he take into account that, for instance, if the Hi-Park Centre is sold, a revenue stream in the region of ¬£800,000 will come from that, which he will additionally have to input in every subsequent year?</p>

<p>There are several points. First, I decline the Member&rsquo;s invitation to brand my party colleague&rsquo;s contribution as petty or partisan. Mr Maginness was possibly making the point partly to counterbalance some remarks made in the Chamber by Nigel Dodds that there had previously been impassioned pleas about north Belfast that I had rejected. That was not exactly true, I hasten to add &mdash;</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.34" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90036" speakername="Mr Nigel Dodds" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I did not say that. I was thanking the Minister.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.35" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90242" speakername="Mr Speaker" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">

<p>I was referring to a previous occasion in the Chamber when the point was made that there had been impassioned pleas.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.37" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90242" speakername="Mr Speaker" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>Order. It is a curious problem when we get confused between praise and blame, but perhaps the Minister will continue to respond to the substantial number of questions raised by Mr Robinson.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.38" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>As regards the further points in relation to the regional rate, clearly we can carry money forward from one year to the next. We have already indicated that in relation to Executive Programme Funds and in relation to an amount for health service capital. It can be done.</p>
<p>However, it would not be appropriate for us to carry money forward from one year to the next simply to offset the rate increase. It would not be good budgeting practice to use budgeted money from one year to reduce revenue needs in another year. Had we tried to do that, many in the House would have raised their eyebrows and said that we were trying to duck hard decisions and were taking softer options. We recognise the serious concerns that are felt in relation to the rates in general, and that is why I will shortly be bringing forward details of the review of overall rating policy, which is provided for in the Programme for Government.</p>
<p>Concerning the Hi-Park Centre, again I would point out that what I have announced today is with the agreement of the Minister for Regional Development, so I hope that all the relevant points have been taken into consideration. It is obviously a matter for him to determine. I am not in a position to specify that the assets that might be sold next year by the Department for Regional Development to reflect that ¬£5 million will necessarily be the Hi-Park Centre. The commitment to the sale of assets is there. However, it does not refer to a specific asset. It is a matter for the Minister for Regional Development, and it would be inappropriate for me to go into any more detail on that point.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I congratulate the Minister. The benefits of having a local hand and local accountability can be seen in the two monitoring rounds, and there have been some impressive results. We are talking about a very significant amount of money, and it is hard to find any grounds for criticism of the announced allocations.</p>
<p>This should not be taken as a sting in the tail. The Minister has demonstrated considerable interest in the subject, but I was disappointed that there was no reference to the gap funding proposal. It was a very welcome announcement by him on the last occasion.</p>
<p>Community and voluntary sector groups are facing a significant problem in the hiatus between the outgoing and incoming European programmes. That time frame may be more significant than was originally thought.</p>
<p>Does the Minister agree that there may be an opportunity to extend the scope, the budget and the time frame of that gap funding proposal so as to ensure that there is no significant loss of capacity, experience or jobs in the most vulnerable parts of our society? The Minister has recognised that problem in the past. There is money in reserve &mdash; he has not spent all his money &mdash; so there is the opportunity to do something about that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.40" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>With reference to what is not in the statement in terms of gap funding, I recognise the concerns felt by many, not just in this House but across the community. We have met bids in previous monitoring rounds in relation to gap funding, particularly with reference to the peace programme. There was no specific bid for gap funding that was not met in this monitoring round. We cannot meet bids that are not presented.</p>
<p>We are trying to keep the wider issue under review on a number of levels. We have to deal with the fact that a considerable amount of money allocated under Peace I has yet to be spent or drawn down &mdash; something like 27% &mdash; and that has to be spent by 31 December 2001. We want to look at the problems in that hold-up and consider what can be done to ameliorate the situation. That could, in turn, ease many of the problems that are manifesting themselves as gap funding issues.</p>
<p>The Member touched upon not just the amounts of money but also the dates. Some groups are on different end dates for funding for different measures, which creates difficulties. We want to look at the total picture and will keep it under review. We will be as responsive and effective in the future as we have tried to be in the past.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.41" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90015" speakername="Dr Esmond Birnie" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I note that the Minister had ¬£68 million available and he allocated ¬£40 million. What is going to happen to the difference? Is he building up a war chest? What is that money for? Is it to bankroll financial mismanagement, possibly in the NHS trusts?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.42" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I have already said that there is ¬£28&nbsp;million that we are not allocating today. We need to look at the deficits issue. There are a number of matters there, not just relating to financial management, but also to service pressures and unmet need. We need to look at this matter in the round and take a balanced approach, with due regard both to financial management and accountability and to service accountability and meeting need. Those are legitimate concerns of the Assembly and the Executive.</p>
<p>I cannot anticipate what will be allocated to the trusts. The Executive will decide after the three Departments involved have looked at the issues and brought recommendations forward. Money can clearly be used in that area, and I have also said that money can be used and carried over in Executive programme funds. It is not a case of building up a war chest. All the moneys available are declared and open. There are no public moneys hidden, and people will see clearly that our system is geared to ensuring that public expenditure takes place rather than does not take place. We need to do more to ensure that public expenditure takes place according to the authority on which it was given.</p>

<p>Many citizens in Northern Ireland have concerns about performance-related pay and fat-cat bonuses, as identified in the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which was published last year. Many people in the Health Service cannot avail of performance-related pay. Can the Minister confirm that work is taking place on these issues? Can he also confirm that those trusts identified this morning &mdash; those whose chief executives are getting performance-related pay while the trusts themselves have a deficit &mdash; and the whole management culture within them will be investigated?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.44" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I recognise, as do most people, the wide concern that the public and the House have about the whole issue of performance-related pay for Health Service managers. That issue has been addressed by the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in communication with the trusts and in legislation.</p>
<p>We also need to be conscious that in this exercise we are trying to deal with service-related problems as well as with financial management. We want to get the total picture. I hope that the wider exercise that we are conducting will address all issues to do with performance-related pay that impact on trust performance and trust deficit. We are not trying to scapegoat anyone; nor will we come up with a short-term fix. We want to deal with the problem in ways that make sense and work for the Health Service as well as for our financial management processes.</p>

<p>A lot has been said this morning about trusts&rsquo; deficits. The Minister has stated that he intends to address further the question of the Health Service trusts&rsquo; deficits and to bring his conclusions to the Assembly as soon as possible. I appreciate that this is a very complex issue, but I would like to know if the Minister is going to give us a timetable for dealing with it as soon as possible. Is it going to be a matter of weeks or months? When does he intend actually to do something about it?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.46" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I do not want to repeat the points I made earlier on the issue in general. On the question of timing, as I indicated in the statement, we clearly need to be able to bring indications forward in time for the spring Supplementary Estimates. We need to table those in mid- February, so it really is a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>I welcome this monitoring round and thank the Minister for it. A number of points have already been covered. I welcome the moneys for children&rsquo;s issues and community care, et cetera. However, I am disappointed that no bid was made, nor moneys allocated, for the purchase of urgently needed library stocks. Can I have a breakdown, perhaps by way of a written reply, of the moneys allocated to the Department of Education for oil? In response to the Minister&rsquo;s comment earlier about budgeting, is it really good budgeting practice to put people out of business with increases in rates?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.48" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>I thank the Member for her broad welcome. The Department of Education has been allocated ¬£1¬∑8 million for fuel costs. I assume that the Member would like that figure to be broken down by board areas or by school sectors, and we will endeavour to do that. Members may recall from the previous monitoring round that some allocations were made to cover fuel costs, particularly for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. No such allocation was made for the Department of Education, so it has to absorb the cost pressures.</p>
<p>I have already indicated that in a few weeks&rsquo; time we will be making a final decision on the rates, based on available figures. If those figures allow us to reduce the rates increase in any way, the Executive will look positively at such an option. I am not confident that there will be significant room for manoeuvre in that regard, but I hope that when the figures become available, I will be consulting with the Committee for Finance and Personnel.</p>

<p>I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, particularly the reference to funding allocations for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. I also welcome the view he expressed on poverty allocation &mdash; I am very glad to hear that.</p>
<p>The issue of Health Service trusts&rsquo; deficits has already been well probed. However, will the Minister ensure that those trusts that are not in deficit, those that have surplus funds or that break even, will not be punished for living within their means, regardless of what is seen to take place?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.50" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>Officials will be examining the trusts&rsquo; figures in detail over the coming weeks. Current estimates suggest that just under half of the 19 trusts experienced a cumulative deficit, but it must be remembered that every trust, bar one, reported a deficit in 1999-2000. Obviously, we will be eager to ensure that any proposals drawn up will deal with the problem in an even-handed and equitable manner.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.51" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90242" speakername="Mr Speaker" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>We have come to the end of the time. Other Members wished to ask questions. Unfortunately, we were not able to get to them.</p>
<p>In that regard, almost all of the Ministers, including Mr Durkan, when asked the same question more than once, are courteous enough to repeat their replies. However, this is not always the best use of time. I will not object if a Minister, when asked a question on the same issue more than once, refers a Member to a reply that he gave earlier. It is another matter if a Member is creative enough to base his question on something closely related, but who frames it in a slightly different way, so that an additional response can be given. I am not suggesting this to enable Ministers to avoid the responsibility to be accountable; rather, I want to ensure that time is properly used.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I would like you to rule, now or later in the day, on comments made earlier by Mr Paisley Jnr during the discussion on the statements by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. As I understood it, Mr Paisley Jnr referred to the attendance or non-attendance of Ministers at meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council, in accordance with their party manifestos. Clearly, Ministers attend those institutions by virtue of the Pledge of Office, which legally binds all Ministers. This admission by the DUP that one of its Ministers is in breach of his Pledge of Office, in accordance with the party manifesto, is an important one.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.4.53" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90242" speakername="Mr Speaker" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#4">
<p>It would be difficult to speak with authority on the specific matter to which you refer. In general, you refer, on the one hand, to Members&rsquo; responsibilities in respect of their manifesto commitments and, on the other hand, to the responsibilities that they may have by virtue of Standing Orders in which the Pledge of Office is mentioned. Obviously, anyone elected to the Assembly has a responsibility to his electorate to uphold his manifesto commitments. However, there are responsibilities in respect of the Assembly that outweigh that. My own position, for example, is a clear case in point. Regardless of any political commitment I may have made to pursue certain matters, it is no longer open to me to follow through these pledges. I have had to forego my involvement in party politics, and it is unlikely that I will be able to return to them in this jurisdiction.</p>
<p>So it is quite clear that certain commitments made when taking office do obviate and overtake manifesto commitments that may have been made.</p>
<p>Without thorough thought, I could not comment on how far that applies to the matter that the Member raises. However, in principle, the pledges one gives to the House when taking office have a particularly special place. They also have particular substance and are therefore taken account of in Standing Orders.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr Speaker. If the Member believes that another Member, a Minister or whatever, is in breach of any pledge of office or any other obligation owed to the Assembly, is it not open to him, or to any Member, or to any party, to propose that that matter be dealt with in the Assembly? Seeking direction from the Speaker is not the only method.</p>
</speech>

<p>It seems appropriate to me that Members seek rulings and guidance from the Speaker inside and outside the Chamber. The Member is entirely right about Members being able to move motions or take other action. However, it is always preferable, before an action of that kind is taken, for a matter to be raised by way of &mdash; I was going to say a warning shot across the bows, but perhaps not &mdash; seeking advice. Sometimes I have to do that with Members to indicate that certain consequences are attached to certain conduct. Of course, whether or not matters are dealt with in that way is not a matter for me.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. This issue of presence at North/South or, indeed, British-Irish Council meetings is not as straightforward as some seem to believe. In fact, the legislation quite clearly provides for circumstances in which it is possible for a Minister to refrain from attending without breaching his pledge.</p>

<p>I think that the Member is simply pointing out the advisedness of my own stance, which is to take advice and study a matter before giving a ruling in the Chamber. I will endeavour to do this in response to the point of order raised by Mr Maskey.</p>
</speech>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. If the Member now wants to put down a motion to exclude the DUP from government, as he clearly will, can you advise him when to submit his motion and how to go about that?</p>

<p>I think the Member is well aware of the procedure. He will also know that unless he has sufficient support, motions for exclusion may not even be debated. The Member who asked the question knows that well, but I think we can accept with some confidence that Mr Maskey is familiar with these procedures also. As the Whip of his party, he has had to address them on a number of occasions.</p>

<p>Some Members may not be familiar with our procedures. Members have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments detailing the order of consideration, and a grouping list of amendments. Members will see from the grouping list that amendments 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be considered together, followed by amendment 5 and then amendment 6. When I call a Member to move the lead amendment in a group &mdash; in this case, amendment 1 out of the group 1 to 4 &mdash; he or she, and any subsequent Members, may address that amendment and any other amendments in the group. I hope that Members will take the opportunity to do that, since it is best for us to have a coherent debate.

<p>It may be helpful for Members if I recap briefly on the purpose of the Bill. The Bill proposes to amend the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. Both Departments have powers under the Act, given the post-devolution split in fisheries functions. Broadly speaking, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has retained responsibility for sea fisheries and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is now responsible for inland fisheries. As the proposed amendments to the Bill were proposed before devolution, it has been agreed that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will take the lead in bringing one Bill to the Assembly on behalf of the two Departments instead of each Department bringing separate Bills.</p>
<p>Clause 1 proposes to provide the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development with the power to regulate the collection of wild shellfish, which are a natural resource, from the intertidal area and to use fisheries&rsquo; regulatory powers to conserve and enhance the environment.</p>
<p>Clause 2 proposes to make it an offence to contravene regulations made under these powers and provides authorised officers with the necessary enforcement powers to enable the Department to enforce such regulations.</p>
<p>Clauses 3 to 7 are the responsibility of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. Clause 3 proposes to lift the restrictions that prohibit trade in salmon roe taken from fish farms and to allow trade in spawn produced at a fish farm for salmon production for human consumption or for stock enhancement. It also gives powers to the Fisheries Conservancy Board (FCB) to control the removal of materials such as gravel from river beds.</p>
<p>Clause 4 proposes to streamline the administrative process through dispensing with the requirement for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to obtain agreement from the Department of Finance and Personnel each time it varies the amount it charges for fishing permits for fishing in the public angling estate.</p>
<p>Clause 5 proposes to provide the FCB with powers to issue angling licences at reduced rates to certain classes of person.</p>
<p>Clause 6 proposes to amend the Act to enable the FCB to make by-laws relating to the management and protection of fisheries and to regulate salmon fishing for environmental purposes.</p>
<p>Clause 7 proposes to strengthen the powers of the FCB to reinstate polluted waters and to recover the full costs from the polluter. Reinstatement will include restocking, restoration and enhancement of the fish habitat to its pre-pollution level.</p>
<p>In my comments on amendment 1, I will also be referring to amendments 2, 3 and 4. As originally drafted, the Bill provides the Department with the power to regulate fishing by means of vehicles and equipment in the area between the sea and high water mean median tide.</p>
<p>The use of the term &quot;foreshore&quot; in the Bill will extend the Department&rsquo;s power only to that area between high water mean median tide and low water mean median tide, because the commonly accepted definition of the foreshore refers only to that area. This leaves a potential loophole in that the commonly accepted definition of the term &quot;foreshore&quot; does not cover that part of the intertidal area between low water mean median tide and low astronomical tide. This area is less often, but still regularly, left uncovered by the movement of tides, and the Department wants to ensure that any regulations made will apply to this area as well as to the foreshore because this area is fertile in wild shellfish.</p>
<p>The purpose of amendments 1 and 2 is to replace the term &quot;foreshore&quot; when used in the Bill with the term &quot;Northern Ireland inshore waters&quot; and to define the term &quot;Northern Ireland inshore waters&quot; as all waters up to high water mean median tide.</p>
<p>Moreover, as a consequence of using the term &quot;Northern Ireland inshore waters&quot; in the Bill, the term &quot;sea-fisheries&quot; is being amended to include any fishery within Northern Ireland inshore waters. This will ensure that any fisheries within Northern Ireland inshore waters are covered by references to sea-fisheries in the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966.</p>
<p>Clause 2 of the Bill, as originally drafted, provides authorised officers with the power to require the attendance of persons in charge of, and any other persons in or on, any vehicle or equipment that is or has been involved in fishing for the purposes of enforcing regulations. However, a person may use a vehicle or equipment that is or has been involved in fishing, but who is not in charge of the vehicle or equipment and who is not in or on the vehicle or equipment. As the Bill stands, an authorised person would have no power to require the attendance of such a person to assist the officer in the performance of his duties, so amendment 3 proposes to extend the enforcement powers of authorised officers in the Bill to provide them with the power to require the attendance of any person using a vehicle or equipment to assist the officer in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the removal of the term &quot;foreshore&quot; from the Bill, the redefining of the terms &quot;sea-fish&quot; and &quot;sea-fisheries&quot; to include fish and fisheries in or on the foreshore in the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 is no longer necessary. The Department therefore no longer wishes to redefine the term &quot;sea-fish&quot; and &quot;sea-fishery&quot; to refer to the term &lsquo;foreshore&rsquo; in the Fisheries Act 1966.</p>
<p>A redefinition of the term &quot;sea-fisheries&quot; to take account of the use of the term &quot;Northern Ireland inshore waters&quot; in the Bill is provided for by virtue of amendment 2 on the Marshalled List. Amendment 4 ensures that these terms are not redefined.</p>
<p>These amendments are necessary to enable the Department to regulate the collection of wild shellfish in the entire intertidal area up to high water mean median tide and to ensure that authorised officers have the appropriate powers to enforce any such regulations. I ask the Assembly to approve these amendments to the Bill.</p>

<p>Before addressing the amendments proposed by the Minister, I would like to convey my appreciation to my Committee colleagues for completing the Committee Stage of the Bill.</p>
<p>The Agriculture and Rural Development Committee dealt with clauses 1, 2 and 9. Clauses 1 and 2 relate to the need to implement measures to protect the foreshore around Northern Ireland from methods of fishing likely to damage the fisheries and the local environment.</p>
<p>The Committee was required to meet on six occasions to complete its work. During its consideration, the Committee received written submissions from six organisations. Subsequently, it took evidence from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the National Trust and the Strangford Lough Management Committee. I would like to thank all the organisations that assisted the Committee for their commitment to this work.</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee had three very helpful meetings with the Department&rsquo;s officials. I am pleased to report that they took on board all of the Committee&rsquo;s concerns and fully explained the technicalities of the Bill. The Department also drafted the amendments agreed with the Committee. I would like to express the Committee&rsquo;s appreciation for the officials&rsquo; help.</p>
<p>The various amendments tabled by the Minister are largely technical in nature and are necessary to tighten up the Department&rsquo;s original wording. In considering them, my Committee was seeking to ensure that the Bill was competent and would have the effect intended by the Minister. I am pleased to say that the Department accepted points made by the Committee, which are now being implemented.</p>
<p>My Committee agreed that these changes are needed, and I commend them to the Assembly.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister a question about amendment 2, which deals with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s inshore waters. Some of the fisheries organisations have told me that they are not happy with the idea of inshore waters being extended six miles from the baseline.</p>
<p>For that reason, perhaps the Minister could indicate to the fishing organisations and myself that any suggested environmental measures will not be detrimental to the fishing organisations operating in that six-mile area. The organisations have said to me that this matter seems to involve more than the foreshore &mdash; it is going further out to sea. For some local fishermen, especially those around the edge of the Ards Peninsula in my constituency of Strangford, it could be disadvantageous. I need an assurance from the Minister that the six-mile radius will not disadvantage local fishermen, and that environmentalists will not be able to impose any measures that will adversely affect the work of the fishermen.</p>

<p>That is the good news.</p>
<p>I thank the Member for his question. The definition of Northern Ireland inshore waters closely follows the definition used in Great Britain legislation to provide for similar regulation. It is based on the commonly accepted definition of inshore waters throughout the UK. They are deemed to extend from six miles out from the coast inwards towards the land, up to the mean high-water mark of ordinary spring tides. This very broad area ensures that all parts of the coast that may be exposed by the movement of tides will be subject to regulation. There will be no detrimental effect on those fishing out at sea. The Department already has adequate powers out at sea.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment 5: In page 3, after line 36 add</p>
<p class="small">&quot;(2) For section 208 of the principal Act (saving for right of owner to take materials from streams) substitute &mdash;</p>
<p class="small">&lsquo;208. Nothing in this Act other than section 48 shall prejudice the right of any owner to take materials from any stream.&rsquo;.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bill was referred to the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee for consideration on 22 September 2000. We considered clauses 3 to 8, and the Agriculture Committee considered clauses 1, 2 and 9.</p>
<p>Clause 3 will amend section 48 of the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. The major rationale for the existence of section 48 is to protect young and breeding fish. That is why rights of owners are restricted and a number of defences have been added to the section 48 offence. The new subsection, through the words on the marshalled list, will provide another defence for the owner of the stream, allowing a person to take materials from the bed of any river with the consent of the FCB.</p>
<p>If consent has been given, no offence is committed.</p>
<p>In collecting evidence, we spoke to the Ulster Angling Federation (UAF), who, in their written submission to us, raised concerns about section 208 of the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966, which states</p>
<p class="small">&quot;Nothing in this Act shall prejudice the right of any owner to take materials from any stream.&quot;</p>
<p>The UAF suggested its removal from the Act, on the basis that it weakened the effect of clause 3(5) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill.</p>
<p>Section 208 overrules section 48 and protects the right of the owner of a stream to remove materials. We sought legal advice on the matter and had correspondence with the Department&rsquo;s legal section. The advice was that section 208 is a general saving provision in the 1966 Act. It protects the right of any owner to take materials from a stream and states that nothing in the Act shall prejudice that general right. Legal advice was that we should not remove or repeal section 208, as that section affected every other provision in the Act. We were advised to consider amending section 208 to read as follows:</p>
<p class="small">&quot;Nothing in this Act, other than section 48, shall prejudice the right of any owner to take materials from any stream.&quot;</p>
<p>I refer Members to page 159 of the minutes of evidence from Monday 4 December 2000.</p>
<p>The Committee is therefore satisfied that the proposed amendment &mdash; adding the words &quot;other than section 48&quot; to section 208 &mdash; will ensure that that section 208 does not dilute or negate the effect of clause 3(5) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. I hope that Members will understand our position.</p>

<p>I thank Mr ONeill and the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee for their hard work during the Committee stage of such a complex and technical Bill. I welcome the amendment that has been put forward by the Committee; it deals with an outstanding problem that otherwise would have to be dealt with by a longer route.</p>
<p>The Committee is acting in line with advice contained in correspondence between my officials and their legal advisers, which was forwarded to it to enable it to arrive at a conclusion on the question of section 208. The Committee has arrived at a sound appreciation of the situation and has acted accordingly.</p>
<p>Section 208 needs to be amended to ensure that clause 3, which, inter alia, will require anyone who wishes to extract materials from a river bed to seek the permission of the FCB first, will be more effective. Section 208 is a saving provision that may or may not have some merit in relation to other parts of the 1966 Act; it has no merit in relation to clause 3 and should therefore cease to apply. That will be the effect of the proposed amendment, which has my full support.</p>

However, the Department now wishes the Act to come into operation as soon as it is made, rather than by appointed day Order, as the latter procedure may delay the coming into operation of the Act. Amendment&nbsp;6 removes the requirement for an appointed day Order and, by remaining silent on the mechanism for coming into operation, will result in the Act coming into operation as soon as it is made. I therefore ask the Assembly to approve this amendment to the Bill.</p>

<p>My Department is currently investigating the potential for developing a viable and sustainable scheme for a national sports stadium for Northern Ireland. In 1999 a pre-feasibility study, carried out under the auspices of the Sports Council, concluded that a proposal for a stadium could succeed under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Subsequently my Department appointed a consultancy firm to undertake a market-sounding exercise to examine the scope of involving the private sector in such a development. This revealed that there was potential for support from the private sector, although a number of crucial issues still remain to be resolved, not least of which is the degree of support in usage to which the key sports would be prepared to commit.</p>
<p>On 25 October 2000 I met with the representatives of the four main sports &mdash; soccer, gaelic, rugby and athletics &mdash; to discuss the case for a national stadium for Northern Ireland. Each sport is considering its needs and the degree to which it could commit to use such a facility. The position of the four main sports will be important in determining the way forward, but if the project is to proceed, substantial funding will be required, and location and accessibility will be key considerations.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his response and particularly for his final words: &quot;location and accessibility will be key considerations.&quot; I assume that consideration will be given to locating a national stadium in an area outside Belfast. Can the Minister inform the House if he has had any consultation with the developers of the proposed Lagan Park, which the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society may be taking on, with a view to building a national stadium?</p>

<p>The location will be crucial, and apart from accessibility to all sections of the community, its potential to contribute to the wider objectives of Government must also be borne in mind. We are not yet at the point where we are considering location, and it would be presumptuous of me to start to be prescriptive of where a national stadium &mdash; if we decide to go ahead with it, and if the sports organisations decide that they want it &mdash; should be.</p>
<p>There are certain criteria that I have tried to indicate, and there is no area that we would be looking to exclude. There are interested parties in Belfast as well as outside Belfast. It is common knowledge that there are areas in the Member&rsquo;s constituency of Lagan Valley and around Lisburn, and the Lagan Valley Park is also under consideration by developers. However, it would be wrong for me to say more at this time.</p>

<p>On the same theme, can the Minister assure the House that his decision will target social need and will benefit the needs of the people outside the greater Belfast area, in particular, those in the north-west?</p>

<p>Yes, targeting social need &mdash; New TSN &mdash; is part of it. We have an action plan for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, and this is referred to in another question, which I hope to answer later. It is very much part of the thinking that although TSN is not a spending programme, it is a way of evaluating proposals, policies, and so on. That would be very much part of an evaluation process in terms of location, if and when we get to that point.</p>

<p>Will the Minister give me an assurance that should the proposal for a national stadium become a realistic prospect, very considerable consideration would be given to its location in order that this may be used not only to develop our sporting culture but also to help achieve economic regeneration?</p>

<p>As I said as part of a supplementary answer, the potential to contribute to the wider objectives of Government and regeneration is a key objective of the Government. Therefore, location will be evaluated not least with regard to that objective. The type of development that the Member mentions, combined with the large number of people that would be expected to go to it, would be a major contributor to economic regeneration and development wherever it is constructed &mdash; if and when it is constructed. Therefore, the location would be a consideration for the Department and the Assembly.</p>

<p>Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission I will take questions 2 and 11 together.</p>
<p>Following the unfortunate sequence of events in the 2000 season, the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland (MCUI) &mdash; the motor-cycle sports governing body &mdash; with the support of the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, established a road racing task force in August last year to conduct a review into road racing safety.</p>
<p>The task force presented its findings to me on 20 December and their recommendations will make a significant contribution to road racing safety. The MCUI is currently considering the task force&rsquo;s findings and will debate, and hopefully ratify, the recommendations at its inter-centre conference on 27 January. It would not be appropriate for me &mdash; in advance of that &mdash; to categorically spell out the range and extent of the actions that will be taken. However, excellent progress is being made, and I will be keen to see many of the recommendations being implemented for the 2001 season.</p>
<p>I recently made ¬£20,000 available to the Sports Council for Northern Ireland to engage a consultant to assess the physical condition of the Province&rsquo;s four existing circuits, and to examine the need, feasibility, and viability of providing a regional motor sports facility. The consultant, International Motor Sports Ltd, has been contracted to undertake the project and the terms of the contract commit them to produce a report on the four short circuits by 8 February 2001 and on the regional motor sport facility by 15 March 2001.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.6.15" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90009" speakername="Mr Billy Armstrong" time="14:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#6">
<p>Can the Minister assure me that circuit racing will not be promoted to the disadvantage of many traditional road races like the Cookstown 100, which takes place on a very safe circuit?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.6.16" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90079" speakername="Mr Michael McGimpsey" time="14:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#6">
<p>The Motor Cycle Union of Ireland has produced the road race task force report, which contains approximately 67 recommendations. Alongside the type of work that the MCUI undertakes on a regular basis, the task force&rsquo;s report will greatly contribute to increasing safety in all of the circuits.</p>
<p>The Cookstown 100 is the first race of the season and it has a good safety record, not least because the venue was changed from the Sherrygrim circuit &mdash; the 6¬∑1 mile circuit &mdash; to the new 3¬∑2 mile Oritor circuit in 1999. That will contribute to the safety of Cookstown 100. However, it would be premature of me to be prescriptive about the measures that will be taken. It will be a matter for the MCUI, at its meeting later this month, to determine whether or not it adopts the 67 recommendations of the task force. It is hoped that it will and then we will take the next step of attempting to ensure that all of the recommendations are incorporated quickly.</p>

<p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and I look forward to seeing the proposals being debated.</p>
<p>Is the Minister aware of the public calls being made by the Dunlop family, among others, for a Northern Ireland motor sport centre of excellence? Will he facilitate the study of the cost implications, tourist potential and sporting development of such a facility in the near future?</p>

<p>The Sports Council for Northern Ireland is responsible for promoting sport, but I am aware of the calls for a centre of excellence. It is an excellent idea, but the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland will have a major say in it, as well as the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, which is the funding body for sports. I am aware that the Dunlop family has an interest in this. The suggestion of a centre of excellence is not something that anyone would dream of ruling out. I have no doubt that when the assessments on the four short circuits and the dedicated circuit are completed, the information will be added to the ongoing debate on this matter.</p>

<p>Belfast City Council is responsible for pursuing the bid for the &quot;city of culture&quot; designation. In June&nbsp;2000 it established a capital of culture steering group, and by the end of this month the group will be constituted as an independent company limited by guarantee &mdash; Imagine Belfast&nbsp;2008. It will have 16&nbsp;directors. The appointment of a chairperson and deputy chairperson is under way and four advisory panels have been formed. The bid is to be submitted by 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2002, and the announcement of a UK shortlist of applicants, which will be designated as centres of culture, will be in autumn 2002. One city from that shortlist will be selected to go forward to the European institutions as the UK&rsquo;s nomination to become European city of culture&nbsp;in 2008.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that such a designation would not only be of enormous benefit to Belfast &mdash; consider what has been achieved in the likes of Glasgow in past years &mdash; but also be of major benefit to all the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland? Therefore it is very important that this be looked upon as a national bid on behalf of the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. There should be widespread support for this bid throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.6.23" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90079" speakername="Mr Michael McGimpsey" time="14:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#6">
<p>I truly agree. While it is a designation for a city, and while Belfast City Council takes the lead in this promotion, we are well aware that the designation is &lsquo;a city of culture in a region of culture&rsquo;. The benefits to Belfast and to all of Northern&nbsp;Ireland will be enormous. We only have to look at the experiences in Glasgow and Dublin to see the sort of benefits that can accrue, not least in the bidding process that will give us benefits in prestige and self-esteem. It is important for the Belfast bid to have widespread support because everybody will benefit, including the other towns and cities in the Province. If we are successful, and I sincerely hope we are, it will be very prestigious for all the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

<p>Has the Minister decided to shelve the joint city approach, which was the initial proposal?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.6.25" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90079" speakername="Mr Michael McGimpsey" time="14:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#6">
<p>I am not aware of a specific joint city approach. This has been ongoing for at least 18&nbsp;months. I am also a member of Belfast City Council, and it has always been my understanding that one city takes the lead, but the emphasis will be on &quot;Belfast, a city of culture in a region of culture&quot;. It is something that joins everyone together. Presumably Mrs&nbsp;Courtney is speaking from the perspective of her own city. Derry will benefit enormously from the bid. It is not simply for the benefit of Belfast, and it would be wrong to see it purely in Belfast terms. It is &lsquo;a city of culture in a region of culture&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We are a small country of about 1¬∑6 or 1¬∑7 million people &mdash; roughly the size of any normal regional city in Europe that might pick up this type of award. We will all do very well out of this. As Mr Neeson said, it is something that merits widespread support and that we can all get together on.</p>

<p>Has the Minister made any detailed estimate of how many additional visitors could be expected to visit Northern Ireland as a whole, instead of just Belfast, as a result of its being designated city of culture? How many additional visitors would be attracted to our many world-famous assets such as the Glens of Antrim and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, as well as to our fine museums and heritage centres? If more people stay overnight, how much additional tourist revenue would there be?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.6.27" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90079" speakername="Mr Michael McGimpsey" time="14:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#6">
<p>We can make a comparison with the last UK city to hold the title, and that was Glasgow in 1990. They experienced a 40% increase in public attendance at theatres, halls, museums and galleries, an 81% increase in the number of tourists visiting arts, events and attractions and generated revenue of between ¬£38 million and ¬£42 million in 1990 terms. Substantial benefits can accrue in respect of tourist visits. Tourist visits to arts events and attractions rose 81% above the level of the last previously measured year. There was also extra employment, estimated at 5,700 man-years, as well as substantial private sector investment. Getting the award is not the only important thing; the bidding process is also valuable, and taking into account the experience of Dublin, Glasgow and other cities, you will attract a seriously increased number of visitors into the area. Being designated a city of culture for all of Europe is a major and prestigious achievement.</p>

<p>My Department has produced an equality scheme, which is currently with the Equality Commission for approval and will, it is to be hoped, be approved in the near future. During the drafting phase it was issued widely for consultation, and it contains a schedule of equality impact assessments which must be completed over the next three years. All of our non- departmental public bodies and associated bodies have produced their own equality schemes, which will be submitted to the Equality Commission for approval.</p>
<p>On New TSN, we have produced an action plan, which will be published alongside all other Departments&rsquo; plans in the near future. Where required, our non- departmental public bodies and North/South bodies are in the process of producing their plans, and these will be issued for consultation in the coming weeks.

<p>Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for that reply. Given the imperative of the Good Friday Agreement and the very clear evidence that has emerged recently of the strong potential for economic development within the Irish-language movement, to give one example that falls to his Department, does the Minister intend to discuss plans with the Minister for Social Development or the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for any collaboration on economic development projects involving the Irish language?</p>

<p>I have said that all Departments will be following the steps that I have laid out regarding equality and new equality schemes such as TSN. I do not currently have any plans for consultation with the Department for Social Development regarding the promotion of the Irish language, but I must point out that my Department has responsibility for language, and it takes that responsibility seriously. My Department has, however, had a degree of success &mdash; and I am sure that we will continue to do so &mdash; in the promotion of Irish and Ulster-Scots, as well as other languages where they are appropriate. As Members are aware, as a result of the agreement, there is a North/South body that is dedicated specifically to language, particularly Irish and Ulster- Scots. Enquiries of that type need to be directed to that body; I cannot answer on its behalf. It may be that they are having ongoing discussions with the Departments that the Member mentioned.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that if there is to be a system for targeting social need, there needs to be, in the first place, an adequate means of measuring the need?</p>

<p>Means of measurement, as a principle, must run throughout Government, including New TSN. We are aware that New TSN is not a spending programme but a theme that runs through existing programmes, requiring us to redirect or shift funding within those programmes to benefit the most disadvantaged people.</p>
<p>My Department is currently reviewing existing indicators, using information available from various functional areas, to produce targeting information. To date the Government and councils have used the Robson indices as indicators of deprivation. However, we are aware that they are not entirely adequate, and it is generally accepted that they must be superseded. The Government are currently undertaking a further exercise, which is being led by Prof Noble of Oxford University. In relation to targets and indicators, it is important to point out that in my Department&rsquo;s plans for New TSN, we are always looking to establish the requirements for baseline information to identify indicators of social disadvantage. That is a recurrent theme in all of the Department&rsquo;s objectives, and it is probably replicated throughout the Departments.</p>

<p>It would not be prudent, or right, for me to comment specifically, other than to say that the parties, including Sinn F√©in, are signed up to the agreement. Equality, which applies to everyone, is part of the agreement. There are no exceptions in our Province and, as I have already indicated, equality covers all sections of the community. No one is excluded from this provision, because no one is exempt from inequality.</p>
<p>Regarding the Diversity 21 &quot;Northern Odyssey&quot;, I agreed with Mr Sammy Wilson, when we met that night, that the event was an excellent example of what we can do as a Department, an Assembly and as a country. I thought that we put on a display that demonstrates how we can handle our culture, history and legacy. It illustrates what we would be doing if Belfast were to be European city of culture 2008. There was universal praise &mdash; not just from the media critics but from the people who went to it. I can also say that the event was recorded in its entirety, and we hope to broadcast it on television so that everyone can enjoy it, not just those who were there.</p>
<p>I understand that there was a criticism along the lines that there was no hint of the Gaelic language. That is incorrect. The White Rose, an opening anthem sung by the Celtic Divas, was specifically written for the show and performed in Gaelic. There were also pieces of work conducted in Ulster-Scots. The criticism may have resulted from a misunderstanding. I am perhaps charitable enough to say that the RUC band was an important part of the proceedings. It was there with the Garda S√≠och√°na band, and I know that we all enjoyed the performance.</p>
<p>On the reference to the Lambeg drums, one of the most important pieces of work undertaken is that by Roy Arbuckle and his Different Drums ensemble. I find the sounds made with the different drums, and his use of the Lambeg drums, exhilarating and exciting, and I think that the 5,000 people who were there that night would agree.</p>

<p>With permission, I will answer questions 5 and 10 together.</p>
<p>It will be helpful if I give an update on the progress of the soccer strategy for Northern Ireland since it was announced last October.</p>
<p>Initially, I established an advisory panel to help guide my Department as it takes this initiative forward. In addition, consultants have been appointed to confer with the whole range of interested groups and individuals on the issues facing the game. These include administrators, managers, coaches, players and the media. So far, more than 2,500 people have been consulted.</p>
<p>In addition to this exercise, the Department organised a series of open meetings last week at different venues throughout the Province. These attracted a significant level of interest from football fans, with several hundred people turning out to make their views known. The consultants will be presenting me with a report of their findings in the near future.</p>
<p>The next and vital stage in the process is a conference workshop organised by my Department. It will bring together, for the first time, representatives of all the key interest groups to debate the issues facing soccer and to develop ideas and recommendations for the future. I anticipate that further work will be required after the conference workshop to develop these ideas, but I expect to be in a position to produce a draft stategy document for consultation by the summer.</p>

<p>In view of the gradual demise of Irish league football, does the Minister agree that time is of the essence? Will the recommendations of the task force, if reasonable, be implemented as soon as possible so as to turn around the fortunes of the footballers and their supporters?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.6.42" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90079" speakername="Mr Michael McGimpsey" time="14:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#6">
<p>I agree that one of the major problems for football, and one of the challenges it faces, is the relative demise of senior clubs in the Irish league. I will not rehearse all of the difficulties faced by football, because they are well documented. It is timely that the task force has come about and that, as a result of devolution, my Department and the Assembly are able to address the needs of soccer in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence, and much depends on what the draft strategy recommends. I cannot pre-empt that &mdash; it is not for me to say what will be in it. But when we get that out for consultation and agreement, the next stage will be to investigate how to implement the proposals. We have managed to find funding for a health and safety programme, which affects soccer as well as other sports. Those are the sort of steps that the House can take, if we have the will to take them.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.6.43" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90057" speakername="Mr David Hilditch" time="14:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#6">
<p>Does the Minister agree that, since the Taylor Report of the early 1990s, many clubs have been compelled to spend hard-earned money on areas relating to health and safety, therefore depriving the game of resources which could have been used, for instance, on youth development? I appreciate the recent announcements about future improvements to stadiums, but will the Minister consider areas of the game, such as youth development, which have been deprived of much-needed resources?</p>

<p>While I do not disagree with Mr Hilditch, this issue will be discussed extensively as part of the soccer strategy and at February&rsquo;s conference. Lots of ideas have evolved. We have had a consultation process to examine the issues and problems and to attempt to set the agenda for the conference. Those who have been involved in this will come up with a series of ideas and proposals, in the form of a draft strategy, which will go out for wider consultation. Among the issues to be examined are youth and junior soccer, the treatment of fans, women&rsquo;s soccer and soccer for the disabled. It is not simply about the Irish league, although the league does play an important part.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his initiative in setting up the task force. The Committee recognises that the consultative arrangements are thorough, but it is concerned that, geographically speaking, the consultation may not be wide enough. Will the Minister look more favourably at ensuring that there are no points of view in any geographical pockets that are ignored in the consultation process? This is an important and valuable exercise, and we want to be as comprehensive about it as possible.</p>

<p>Broadly, I agree with Mr ONeill&rsquo;s sentiments. We are looking for as widespread a consultation as possible. We went out, for example, in the form of a travelling roadshow to consult the general public. We went to Craigavon, Belfast, Omagh, Ballymoney and Londonderry. That was with careful consideration. I am happy to go back and talk to the Department and interested members of the Committee again and to consider, perhaps, the need for visiting one, two, three or four more venues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.6.50" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90108" speakername="Ms Brid Rodgers" speakeroffice="The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development" time="15:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#6">
<p>My Department continues to deal with brucellosis in cattle through a biennial blood-testing programme. Where infection is found, an intensified testing regime is applied around the infected premises, through contiguous to the infected herd &mdash; the inner-ring herds &mdash; being restricted and tested immediately, and subsequently at four-monthly intervals. Herds in an outer ring &mdash; that is, herds contiguous to the inner ring &mdash; are tested immediately and at four-monthly intervals. That is the basic testing programme.</p>
<p>However, concerns at the level of brucellosis have led us to take a number of additional measures. First, in the more heavily infected areas &mdash; Armagh, Newry and Enniskillen &mdash; we have increased the frequency of testing from biennial to annual. Secondly, we are about to undertake a blood sampling programme for cows being slaughtered under the over-30-months scheme and intend to extend a pilot bulk milk sampling programme to all areas of Northern Ireland in the near future. These two measures would help to provide an early indication of infection and point up the need for a full herd test in the herd of origin.</p>

<p>I am delighted to see that, in line with the objective of eradication, the Minister has confirmed that blood tests are currently being taken at the abattoir from culled animals over 30 months old and that spot milk samples are being taken in high-risk areas. Will the Minister confirm whether there is any correlation between high incidence and geographical proximity to the border? Will she assure the House that, should any correlation exist, she will actively pursue this aspect of animal health with her counterparts in the neighbouring state?</p>

<p>I do not have evidence suggesting any such correlation, but I am aware that disease does not recognise borders. I am therefore in consultation with Minister Walsh in the Republic through the North/South Ministerial Council. We have initiated a programme that will lead to joint strategies on animal health on the island of Ireland.</p>

<p>Brucellosis is costing the industry dearly. In 1995-96, we had three outbreaks in Northern Ireland. In 1999-2000, 172 herds had reactors. Those figures are a matter of concern. Does the Minister agree that it would be a good idea to have an all-Ireland disease eradication programme?</p>

<p>The eradication programmes North and South have the same aims. Our approaches to the control of brucellosis are broadly similar. Nevertheless, there is merit in working more closely with our Southern counterparts to our mutual benefit. I am taking this matter forward through the North/South Ministerial Council. While existing co-operation is good, and has been over the years, we have an opportunity through the working group on brucellosis and tuberculosis recently established by the council to put that co-operation on a more formal and structured footing. That will be to the benefit of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in the Republic in controlling and eradicating brucellosis. That will further benefit the whole industry on the entire island.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has pointed out the particularly high incidence of brucellosis in the Newry and Armagh regions in the last three calendar years.

<p>I am sorry. I asked if the Minister was aware of the concerns about the movements to which I referred and of the concerns that such movements may contribute to the spread of brucellosis. Has the Minister or her Department considered any recommendations to address those concerns?</p>

<p>I thank the Member for his question. I am aware that those concerns have been raised, but where the disease is present there is always a risk that it can be spread mechanically on footwear. The more important vectors of brucellosis are the movement of infected material, contact between neighbouring herds and the movement of infected materials &mdash; aborted foetuses or afterbirth &mdash; by birds, dogs, foxes or other wildlife. Nevertheless, Department officials have made the security forces aware of the need to take appropriate precautions when crossing farmland.</p>

<p>While the specific criteria applied to the decision-making process may vary according to the nature of the issue under consideration, I assure the Member that all such decisions are taken in the light of objectively based evidence of such criteria as income levels, geographic location and size of holding.

<p>I am aware that there is need throughout the agriculture industry, and there is an overall need. I am, however, aware that the smaller producers face greater difficulties in this situation. Therefore in targeting social need I have to take into consideration their incomes and their needs.</p>

<p>There are several recent examples &mdash; for instance, the protection for small producers within the beef special premium (BSP). The removal of the 90-head limit on claims for BSP was agreed collectively by the four UK Agriculture Ministers and will apply from the 2001 scheme year. In doing so, there was concern about the possible adverse effects on small producers if the removal of the limit leads to the UK regional ceiling&rsquo;s being exceeded, with consequent scaling back of producers&rsquo; claims. It was decided to protect the incomes of smaller- scale producers by exempting those claiming on up to 30 animals per year from any scale back if the national ceiling is exceeded.</p>
<p>Also, the beef national envelope decision means that this money is part of the European Union&rsquo;s Agenda 2000 package of direct support for agriculture. For 2001, Northern Ireland received additional funds of ¬£2¬∑6 million, ¬£1¬∑6 million of which I have allocated to suckler cow producers. Using 60% of the funds as a top-up to the suckler cow premium scheme should benefit those farming enterprises that are generally accepted as being among the most disadvantaged.</p>

<p>I am disappointed that the Minister does not intend to submit papers about the find of contaminated beef in Newry last week. I urge her to bring before the House and the Executive proposals that would turn the discovery of contaminated German beef to the advantage of the Northern Ireland producer. Does she intend to meet the European Union Commissioner for agriculture, her German counterpart, and Nick Brown to ensure that the Northern Ireland beef export ban is lifted? On the previous occasion on which she spoke, the Minister informed the House that her strategy on low BSE status had had to be shelved until a more appropriate time: surely, now is the appropriate time for decisive action to have the ban on our beef exports lifted.</p>

<p>The incident at Newry is not a matter for my Department; it comes within the remit of the Food Standards Agency, which is an agency of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
<p>I am not convinced that pointing to a breach of the rules by the Germans will be helpful in persuading others that Northern Ireland beef is safe. More relevant will be the evidence of the true incidence of BSE in other member states produced by the tests that they are now compelled to carry out, as well as evidence of the true incidence in Northern Ireland, which will become obvious over the next few months. I assure Members that if those figures are in any way helpful to our case, I will use them to press for a relaxation of the ban.</p>
<p>As I have frequently told the House, I shall make a move to seek a relaxation of the ban when I am certain that the time is right. I shall base my decision on the advice that I receive from the various people in Europe who have just been mentioned, including the relevant Ministers and Commissioner Byrne, whose advice on the matter I have sought in the past. In the meantime, my officials continue to make whatever changes are required to our final proposals to the Commission.</p>
<p>I am totally committed to achieving the relaxation of the ban. It may well be that I can turn the present situation in Europe to our advantage. However, when we do seek to have the ban relaxed, I will be looking for the support of all the other member states. The Member should remember that. Criticising member states that are facing difficulties is not the best way to get their support when we need it.</p>

<p>There is deep concern about what happened in Newry last week. I ask the Minister to confirm that she not only is interested in protecting the beef industry but also has equal concern for the consumer. Can she give us some more details of the protections that she could put place to ensure that both the industry and the consumer are kept safe?</p>

<p>The Department has very strict controls in place to protect the consumer. With regard to this particular incident, the fact that the spinal cord was detected is a clear indication that our controls are working well and that no contaminated food has reached the consumer. The few instances that we have had in Northern Ireland have always proved that our controls work and that the consumer is protected. Consumer protection has to be a priority with all of us. Food safety is certainly a priority with the Executive, and I will be doing everything in my power within my Department to ensure that the controls that we have continue to be in place. I reiterate that, in my view, our controls are as good as any, if not the best, in the whole of Europe. This will be part of our strong argument when we come to make the case for the relaxation of the ban.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that no one in Northern Ireland is in any way responsible for, or has any guilt in relation to, what happened in Newry? Does she agree that this is the sole responsibility of the German authorities who brought this beef in sealed and with a certificate stating &mdash; as was given in evidence to my Committee today &mdash; that this beef was up to EU standard? When it was opened, it was found that, on three quarters of a beast, the spinal cord had not been dealt with as it ought to have been. Does she not feel that it is her business to take this up with the German Government? If this beef had got into the food chain of Northern Ireland, it could have caused serious difficulty. Does she not realise from reading the English press that the farmers of Northern Ireland have been attacked, the producer has been attacked and the man in charge of the meat has been attacked? Everybody has been attacked, and another black mark has been placed against people in Northern Ireland who are absolutely innocent.</p>

<p>I have some concerns about how this incident has been handled in the media over the past few days. I absolutely agree with the Member that there is no fault whatsoever accruing to anyone in Northern Ireland for what has happened. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has raised this matter with the Germans and with Commissioner Byrne. The Member will be aware that this is a matter for the FSA, not for my Department. The FSA is an agency of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. No-one in Northern Ireland is to blame, and our procedures worked impeccably.</p>
<p>There has been a suggestion that the incident somehow reflects badly on the beef industry. It is not useful to continue to say that. My concern is that if I were to make a statement about it, as I have been called on publicly to do, it would serve only to prolong what has become a very unwelcome debate. I believe that other member states and the commission will be well aware of where the fault lies for this episode, without my needing to make any further comment on it. As I have already said, it is not a matter for my Department but has been raised with the Germans and Commissioner Byrne by the Food Standards Agency.</p>

<p>The Department&rsquo;s scientists already contribute to the scientific advice on which the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for total allowable catches and member states&rsquo; quotas are based.

<p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reply. Our local fishermen are extremely angered by the recent cutbacks in quotas and the threat to many jobs in the fishing industry. In view of this, will the Minister assure the House that scientists from her Department will work with local fishermen to seek to satisfy, as early as possible, the requirements of the EU Commission, especially by allowing prawn fishing while protecting cod stocks?</p>

<p>I am very anxious that we should work with the fishing industry. The scientists will work with the local fleet to ensure that all possible technical measures are put in place to allow the prawn fisheries to go ahead without a by-catch of cod. Last Friday morning I had a meeting with the scientists to keep myself up to date, and I assure the Member that the scientists are very anxious to help the industry. They will be meeting with members of the fishing industry and working in conjunction with them.</p>

<p>I was pleased with the success in obtaining the Commission&rsquo;s agreement to a 28% increase in the permitted herring catch as well as a 58% increase for haddock and 33% for plaice. It was, however, disappointing that the Commission went against the advice it received and reduced the nephrops catch by 10%. Overall, we can claim some success against our objectives, but I accept that the industry does face a very difficult year, and I will be doing all I can to help it.</p>
<p>We did obtain a formal declaration from the Commission that it would revise the tax of those species caught in association with cod or hake, if information provided by the member states indicated that this was appropriate. I am discussing that with my Department&rsquo;s scientists at the moment, and I hope that this will enable the Commission to restore the 10% cut in nephrops imposed by the Fisheries Council.</p>
<p>As part of the cod recovery plan for 2001, we were successful in obtaining our derogation for the Northern Ireland fleet to enable it, under controlled conditions, to demonstrate a clean haddock fishery.</p>

<p>I have always been in favour of paying all available agrimoney compensation to our hard-pressed farmers, and my position on this has not changed. However, decisions on the issue must be taken at a UK level, requiring agreement between the four UK Agriculture Ministers and the Treasury. Agrimoney compensation represents one of the very few ways in which we can channel money directly into the hands of producers without breaching the very strict EU state aid rules. I was instrumental in initiating the moves which led to the securing of an additional ¬£8¬∑5 million compensation for Northern Ireland dairy, beef, sheep and arable farmers last year.</p>
<p>I have already written to the British Agriculture Minister, Nick Brown, about the latest tranches of compensation that have now become available for beef, sheep and dairy producers, urging him to approach the Treasury to obtain its agreement to draw down those additional funds. Indeed, as far back as October last year, I raised the issue of agrimoney compensation at the meeting of the UK&rsquo;s Agriculture Ministers.</p>
<p>In my endeavours, I welcome the support of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union as well as that of the English and Scottish unions.</p>

<p>As the Member is aware, the agrimonetary compensation runs out after three&nbsp;years. Of course, what happens after that will be a matter for negotiation with the European Commission and between the Commission and the UK Government.

<p>I trust that the question refers to the next tranche. It will be a number of weeks yet before the EU Commission completes its very complex calculations on this matter. It would be wrong for me to speculate now exactly how much may be made available to Northern Ireland producers; we will have to wait until the Commission produces the exact figures.</p>
<p>There will be a modest compulsory element in the overall total, which represents the third and final tranche of the compensation that was triggered on the establishment of the euro on 1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999. This is payable to beef and sheep producers and will be worth approximately ¬£2¬∑6&nbsp;million for Northern Ireland. I say approximately, because until the calculations have been made, it is not possible to be exact.</p>
<p>Unless there is a very significant strengthening of the euro during the first half of this year, Northern Ireland arable producers will also qualify for approximately ¬£0¬∑2&nbsp;million.</p>

<p>I am very conscious of local concerns about flood risk from the river Bann and its tributaries at Portadown. A previous proposal for a scheme exhibited for public comment in 1992 did not command comprehensive public support and was postponed when severe resource pressures were imposed on the budget of the then watercourse management division. I am pleased to report that in November last the Rivers Agency initiated an independent study to review the previous proposals and to identify and examine options that had not been considered previously.</p>
<p>The commissioning of consulting engineers will be completed by the end of this month. The study will examine options to provide existing property with the currently accepted standard of flood protection. It will take account of technical advances and flood estimation and will consider methods of integrating proposals with the amenity potential afforded by the river. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2001 and will include an environmental impact assessment and wide public consultation with a number of interest groups, including Craigavon Borough Council.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for her response and note her remarks about the current survey.</p>
<p>However, does she agree that in the absence of effective flood control measures the natural development of Portadown is obstructed, natural planning of the town is frustrated and natural economic progress is stunted? Does the Minister also agree that a comprehensive strategic study, together with costings for the entire river basin from the Mournes to Banbridge to Portadown to Coleraine and the associated water levels in Lough Neagh, would bring about informed new engineering solutions to the flooding problems and alleviate the flooding of the agricultural land, particularly around the Birches area of Portadown, and will she facilitate such a study?</p>

<p>I would certainly support the idea of a comprehensive study of an integrated approach to the problem in Portadown. I am aware of the problems in the area and attach high priority to implementing schemes within available resources. The Rivers Agency has to execute an extensive programme within its annual capital budget of approximately ¬£8 million, and an objective methodology has been devised so that projects are prioritised. A current study would release land that is blighted for development, and it is also examining the option of providing existing property with an accepted standard of flood protection.</p>
<p>It is departmental policy not to encourage development on flood plains, although the possibility of a scheme that by nature of its design provides an opportunity for development cannot be discounted. It is extremely important that development is not undertaken on flood plains, so that we are not in danger of having here the scenes of flooding that we saw on our televisions last year in England.</p>

<p>I would like to start by setting out the facilities that the Commission has already put in place.</p>
<p>Arrangements can be made for disabled visitors or staff to be set down, collected or to park in the upper east, or upper west, car parks. Parliament Buildings can be accessed from these car parks through doors specifically designed for use by disabled persons. A lift is reserved for use by disabled persons and can be accessed via ramps from either of these car parks.</p>
<p>There are various facilities in Parliament Buildings. For example, specially equipped toilets for disabled persons are available on each floor of the building. In the Assembly Chamber there is one wheelchair space in the viewing Gallery at either side of the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair. A maximum of two blind visitors with their dogs may sit the public Gallery. There is an induction loop to help visitors who have hearing difficulties, and there are appropriate hearing aids throughout the public Galleries. Advance provision can also be made for interpreters to sit in on Assembly proceedings. Disabled visitors in wheelchairs are catered for along the route for tours. Visitors with hearing difficulties who wish to go along the route can be accompanied by their own interpreter.</p>
<p>The Assembly Commission is aware of its responsibilities to ensure that all users of the Building, whether they are able-bodied or have some form of disability, have access to all parts of Parliament Buildings, and over the past two years it has commissioned access audit reports from Disability Action, Guide Dogs for the Blind and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. A common theme running through all three reports is the need for staff training. The programme of staff training recommended by Guide Dogs for the Blind has already been implemented, and courses in wheelchair awareness and deaf awareness for front-line Assembly staff are ongoing.</p>
<p>The Assembly Commission has recently received a very detailed report from the Construction Service. It brings together the recommendations of the three earlier reports and has produced a series of cost proposals for improving access to and around Parliament Buildings. As a result, the Commission has appointed a health and safety specialist to take forward the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>

<p>I thank the member of the Commission for a detailed report. One of the many issues that concern us is access for people with disabilities. There is only one access area at present &mdash; at the east wing &mdash; and one lift, which has broken down many times over the last number of months. Thankfully, no one with a disability &mdash; in particular, a wheelchair user &mdash; has needed to use it. However, it is still important to provide front access to the building for those with disabilities. The Assembly Commission also needs to consider that the gift shop is totally inaccessible for anyone in a wheelchair. The Construction Service&rsquo;s report has been available for a year now. Why has the Commission not yet acted to ensure that its recommendations have been put in place?</p>

<p>The Member has asked a number of questions. First, everyone accepts that many issues could have been acted on earlier. Part of the problem has been the Assembly&rsquo;s stop-start environment. We have had suspensions, the normal summer recess, as well as a shortage of staff. A specialist is in place who will shortly be bringing detailed proposals to the Commission, which came out of the Construction Service&rsquo;s report. For example, the issue of access by the front door was referred to in detail in the report, and it will be dealt with. The Commission is aware of all its responsibilities in that area under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Indeed, we are aware of all the equality legislation. The Commission will ensure that all initiatives are equality proofed. If current arrangements are not sufficient, members of the Commission are open to consideration and suggestions from Assembly Members. We would welcome that.</p>

<p>The Commission will be aware that, despite the House of Commons being even less accessible to disabled people than Parliament Buildings, the authorities at Westminster have succeeded in making it more user-friendly. Given that there are bound to be areas of common interest in legislative buildings, has the Commission considered consulting with the authorities at Westminster on the issue?</p>

<p>Yes. Indeed, the Commission consults on all issues not only with the authorities at Westminster, but also with the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales and with the Administration in the South of Ireland. Therefore the Commission is certainly open to &mdash; I suppose this is about not reinventing the wheel &mdash; looking at other areas and taking everything on board.</p>

<p>The issue of flags was considered by the Assembly Commission on 20 November 2000, when it was agreed to defer further deliberation until the Commission had received background papers. The Commission intends to return to the flags issue at an early Commission meeting. The members of the Commission realise that the resolution of the flags issue is a very sensitive and complex matter, and while the Commission would prefer to take its direction from the Assembly, it is recognised that the process has failed in that regard. However, the matter is under consideration.</p>

<p>I thank the Commission member for her answer. I agree that it is a sensitive and, at times, vexed issue. Does she agree that the Commission&rsquo;s initial decision to continue to fly the flags before the institutions went live was an interim decision, that it was not intended to be permanent? And does she agree, given the fact that to date no proposals have come forward from the Commission regarding the flying of flags from Parliament Buildings, that the decision has assumed a degree of permanency that needs to be reviewed in the light of human rights and equality legislation? Can the Member assure me that the Commission will consider the interim decision as a matter of urgency?</p>

<p>First, what is in place at the minute is really custom and practice. That means that the status quo remains until change is agreed by the Assembly or the Commission. As I said, the issue was raised on 20 November 2000. It was agreed to defer it until background papers were provided. It will be raised again at further meetings of the Commission.</p>

<p>I commend Mr Murphy&rsquo;s timing of the question, as today is the 200th anniversary of the first sitting of the new Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Does the Commission member agree that the policy of adhering to custom and practice at Commission level, as she has described it, has been successful? Should it be felt necessary to revisit this issue? The matter should be resolved on the Floor of the Assembly rather than at Commission level, and if it cannot be, custom and practice should continue.</p>

<p>As I said before, the procedures of custom and practice are in place. The issue is up for discussion by the Commission, and I do not want to pre-empt the Commission&rsquo;s decision. It is an issue that the Commission has considered and will do so again in the future.</p>

<p>First, I will point out that I am not a man &mdash; I am actually a woman. It would be better if the Member looked more closely at that.</p>
<p>I am here to represent the Assembly Commission, and the answer given is on behalf of the Commission. This is an issue that arises periodically in the Commission for discussion. It came up on 20 November 2000, and it will come up again.</p>

<p>The Commission member has informed the Assembly that this is an interim decision to fly the Union flag, based on custom and practice; that the decision is likely to be reviewed at some future date by the Commission; and that there is no lawful authority for that, statutory or otherwise. The business of the Commission has usually been characterised by efforts to achieve consensus on all issues. In the light of that approach, does the representative agree that the Commission will continue to seek a decision that will attempt to please the vast majority of people in the Chamber on this very vexed and divisive issue?</p>

<p>I trust that Members have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments. I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the corrigendum &mdash; a correction to the wording of amendment 6. I will remind Members of this when we come to it.</p>
<p>We also have a grouping of amendments. I ask Members to refer to that grouping in the debate. Knowing that not all Members have fully participated on a regular basis in Consideration Stages, I simply point out that we take the amendments in turn.</p>
<p>There are four groups. We will debate the amendments referred to in each group. The first debate will be on amendments 1 and 2, the second on amendments 3 and 6, the third on amendment 4, and the fourth on amendment 5.</p>
<p>However, the voting on the amendments will come in the order in which they appear. We will vote on each clause on its own, in the context where there is no amendment, or subsequent to the amendment being voted upon.</p>
<p>No amendments having been tabled to clauses 1 to 20, I propose, by leave of the Assembly, to group them for the purposes of voting.</p>

<p>No 2 (clause 22): In page 11, line 15, leave out &quot;18&quot; and insert &quot;17&quot;. &mdash; <i>[Dr Hendron]</i></p>
<p>The Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee considered the Bill, which covers 19 different issues, over a period of six weeks last November and December. As Members will have read in the Committee&rsquo;s report, many important issues were raised during the deliberations. The Committee was satisfied that these issues had been carefully considered by the Department before the Bill was drafted, with wide consultation having taken place on some and on-going discussions on the detail of others. I am assured that the Committee will be consulted further before these are finalised.</p>
<p>Although they were not part of the Bill, two important issues were raised during deliberations, which are important enough to bring to the attention of the House and to which my amendments relate.</p>
<p>The first covers the ambiguity in the use of the term &quot;residential care&quot;. Whilst appreciating that planning applications are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, the Committee wishes to highlight that the term appears to have a different legal meaning in planning legislation to that used by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the Registered Homes (Northern Ireland) Order 1992.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Committee, I have written to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister asking for the matter to be discussed by the Executive. If the matter is not resolved, it will have serious implications for those wishing to appeal against planning applications. This morning, I received a reply from the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and I will be bringing this up with the Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A prime example is the establishment of Brindley House, a private children&rsquo;s home in county Fermanagh, which obtained planning permission for a residential care home under the Department of Environment&rsquo;s planning regulations. Local residents understood that it was to be a home for the elderly and they were concerned when it turned out to be a children&rsquo;s home. However, it was too late to raise objections.</p>
<p>There is a great need for many more children&rsquo;s homes, as my Committee indicated in our recent report on residential and secure accommodation and local communities must be prepared to accept more children&rsquo;s homes if children in care are to remain in their own areas. However, it is most important that planning applications are clear and do not lead to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Amendment number 2 refers to the discrepancy in the upper age limit between the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 &mdash; which defines a child as a person under the age of 18 years &mdash; and the Criminal Justice (Children) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 &mdash; which defines an adult as a person who has attained the age of 17.</p>
<p>The Committee is aware that criminal justice is a reserved matter, but feels very strongly that young people in Northern Ireland, especially those in care, should not be required to attend adult court sessions or be held in adult jails at the age of 17.</p>
<p>I have written to the Secretary of State in my capacity as Committee Chairperson, strongly recommending that he revisits this matter during the ongoing criminal justice review. I seek the support of Assembly Members and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to raise this important issue with the appropriate authorities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.7.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90047" speakername="Mr Tommy Gallagher" time="15:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#7">
<p>I support the amendments. As the Chairperson said in relation to amendment 2, the discrepancy is a matter for the Northern Ireland Office. The other ambiguity he referred to concerns two Departments &mdash; the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of Environment &mdash; which have devolved responsibilities and which are adopting different approaches leading to ambiguity about the terms used to describe children&rsquo;s residential homes.</p>
<p>This issue came to light in my own constituency with the case of Brindley House. The planning application for that development came before the local council in the normal way, and it was described as a &quot;residential home&quot;. Planning was subsequently approved. Thereafter, it became clear that the development was for a children&rsquo;s residential home, and there was considerable controversy and protest involving residents in the vicinity. Locally elected representatives were called to account and asked why approval had been given without any questions being asked. Most of my colleagues on Fermanagh District Council had assumed that it was residential accommodation for the elderly.</p>
<p>There is an ambiguity, and local people affected see it as a shortcoming in the planning process and as something that requires particular attention. Such applications, when they are submitted, should specifically state the purpose of the development. Everyone understands that there is a need for residential accommodation for children in care, and that it must be provided for somewhere in the local community. However, the co-operation of local people is important, and that is more likely to be forthcoming where there is clarity surrounding the application. Therefore, this amendment is necessary if we are to avoid a repetition of the experience in Fermanagh where local people were, and remain, dissatisfied about the development. The Executive should tidy up this issue because it is a devolved matter for the Administration and the two Departments that I identified.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat. I want to briefly clear up a wee issue which the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety mentioned.</p>
<p>In case there is any confusion, I want to put on record that the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee is not against the need for residential homes. From the outset, there is a need for consultation with all interested parties. Brindley House has been mentioned. However, I do not think that the issue is about whether that was an elderly people&rsquo;s home or a children&rsquo;s home. The issue is about planning applications and the need to reword them so that residents and elected representatives can be involved from the start in order to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the Committee for their careful consideration of the Bill. With regard to amendment No 1, the present Bill and social services legislation generally must recognise different client groups in the terminology used. That is necessary to ensure that our regulatory framework is appropriate to widely differing needs. I cannot speak for the Department of the Environment, but I suspect that there may be difficulties in using the same terminology across the board. I look forward to seeing the outcome of the correspondence between the Speaker and the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the issue.</p>
<p>With regard to amendment No. 2, I am aware that the Chairperson has written to the Secretary of State regarding the definition of &quot;child&quot; in criminal justice legislation and about the holding of children in adult prisons. I recognise the concerns that have been raised by the Committee, and I will be interested to see the response from the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Members who have not so far involved themselves in much consideration of legislation may not be aware of the different reasons for putting down amendments. Members will, of course, put down amendments with the intention of pressing them to agreement or to a Division, to ensure that they are incorporated in the Bill. However, Members may also table probing amendments. That is the case with the current amendment, as has been indicated by the Member&rsquo;s request for leave to withdraw. If a matter cannot be discussed or debated unless there is an amendment to speak to, an amendment will be tabled. A probing discussion will take place, at the end of which the Member begs leave to withdraw. It is, of course, the case that the Member must have leave to withdraw.</p>
<p>There are two amendments in this group. One has been moved by the Member, who has now begged leave to withdraw it; the second has not yet been moved. When we come to the second amendment, Dr&nbsp;Hendron will simply say &quot;Not moved&quot; &mdash; I assume that on the basis of what he has just said. Many Members are familiar with legislation, but not everyone is, and we are trying to move forward together.</p>

<p>Amendment 3 to clause 44 and the associated repeal of paragraph 16(d) of schedule 3 to the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 remove any possibility of challenge to the Department&rsquo;s powers to direct health and social services trusts on terms and conditions of service for their staff.</p>
<p>It has been recognised for some time that the general powers of direction contained in paragraph 6 of schedule 3 were considerably less robust than had been envisaged. That was because the Department could only direct trusts in matters in which it had already directed boards and agencies. Accordingly, the original formulation of the Bill contained provisions designed to strengthen the departmental power of direction by requiring trusts to comply with any directions given by the Department on the exercise of its functions. That provision, which is significantly more robust than the original, will be retained in the Bill and will enable the Department to direct trusts on such matters as the delivery of ministerial priorities in relation to service provision.</p>
<p>However, doubts persisted that that general power of direction may be susceptible to legal challenge so long as there was an expressed freedom contained in paragraph 16(d) of schedule 3. That enabled trusts to determine their own terms and conditions of service without any further qualification. Accordingly, the amendment now proposed retains the freedom of trusts to employ such staff as they see fit. That will cover areas such as numbers and grades of staff. It also retains the freedom of trusts to develop individual pay schemes or to vary the terms and conditions of service of their staff. However, it makes it clear that in such matters the Department&rsquo;s powers of direction under paragraph 6 take precedence.</p>
<p>It is likely that the new power of direction in relation to terms and conditions of service will be applied in the first instance to the introduction of the new pay and grading system for senior executives, which is currently being developed in conjunction with the NHS confederation.</p>

<p>The need for this amendment was identified during the Committee Stage of the Bill, and once again I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairperson and the members of the Committee for their careful consideration of the Bill. The amendment is designed to clarify the circumstances in which the Commissioner for Complaints may disclose information obtained by him in the course of an investigation. The information is to the effect that a person is likely to constitute a threat to the health or safety of service users, and the proposed amendment would clarify to whom the information may be disclosed. Provision is also made that if the identity of the person who may represent a danger to health is known, he or she must be told that the information has been disclosed and to whom it has been disclosed. Any subsequent action would be for an employer through normal disciplinary procedures or any person with whom the person is in contract.

<p>The need for this amendment was also identified during the Committee&rsquo;s Consideration Stage of the Bill. The amendment would add health and social services councils to the list of health and personal social services bodies who must hold open meetings. Councils were set up under the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 to represent the interests of the public in their area. In keeping with this remit it is the current practice of each council to allow public access to all its meetings.</p>
<p>The amendment would ensure that public access to council meetings is on a similar statutory basis to the other bodies. The amendment does not reflect any change in the policy aims of the Bill. Molaim leas√∫ uimhir a c√∫ig.</p>

<p>I support the amendment to clause&nbsp;54. While considering the Bill during the Committee Stage, members of our Committee wondered why the health and social services councils were not included in the list of health and social service bodies covered by the Bill.

<p>I will try to be as brief as possible, perhaps even more brief than the Chairperson of the Health Committee. As the Chairperson said, this was one of the matters that I raised in the Committee, and I am glad that this amendment has been put forward. I trust that Members will support it. It is important that health councils are included. At a time when we hear greater calls for accountability in the health service, it is most important that the councils are brought on board. If, as they say, they represent the public&rsquo;s views when decisions are being made about our services, it is most important that each and every one of our Members backs this amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.8.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" speakeroffice="The Minister of Finance and Personnel" time="16:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#8">
<p class="small">That this Assembly approves the New Valuation List Order (Northern Ireland) 2000.</p>
<p>This is a very straightforward Order, containing just one substantive article. Article&nbsp;2 specifies the financial year ending on 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2003 as the year in which a new valuation list will be issued for rating purposes. The new list will contain updated rateable values applicable to commercial properties throughout Northern Ireland. A few brief remarks about revaluation may provide Members with some background and help to place the Order in its proper context.</p>
<p class="italic">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the Chair)</p>
<p>The basis on which commercial properties are valued in Northern Ireland, for rating purposes, is the same as that used in England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland &mdash; the estimated rental value of the property at a fixed point in time. The last revaluation in Northern Ireland was carried out in the mid-1990s, and the new valuation list came into force on 1 April 1997 based on rental values as they existed on 1 April 1995.</p>
<p>Since this list came into effect the level and pattern of those 1995 values has been maintained. This means that an altered property, or a new property coming onto the list for the first time, is assessed on the basis of the value it would have had almost six years ago, reflecting the physical state and economic circumstances of the locality at that time.</p>
<p>However, as we all know, property values have changed over the past six years, and as a result, the valuation list is becoming progressively out of date. Value changes are not confined merely to the effects of inflation over this period but, more importantly, are also caused by social, environmental and economic factors. These have created shifts in the relative values of property today, compared with the pattern of assessments in the current list. These shifts are widespread and exist within and between different classes of property and between one location and another.</p>
<p>The continuing use of rateable values, based on outdated rental values, acts to distort the fair distribution of the rate burden between individual ratepayers &mdash; for example, businesses in areas which have experienced relative economic decline since the last revaluation will now be paying too much in rates whereas businesses which have benefited from improved economic conditions in the intervening years will now be paying too little. The decrease in credibility of the list cannot be corrected without a revaluation.</p>
<p>A five-yearly cycle of revaluations has been established in Great Britain in recent years. The currency of the Northern Ireland list will fall further behind those in Great Britain if a local revaluation is not carried out now. After many years the South is also moving towards regular revaluations, which have been accepted as a normal and routine part of any fair and equitable rating system.</p>
<p>A revaluation now in Northern Ireland will deliver greater equity and fairness. It will also greatly reduce instances of the dramatic rate swings which, as Members recall, were an unfortunate feature of the last revaluation, and which resulted in some individuals facing very large rate increases.</p>
<p>I intend that the new valuation list should be issued not later than 31 December next year and come into force on 1 April 2003. The Order we are considering today will enable that to happen, and I commend it to the Assembly.</p>

<p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Many business people throughout Northern Ireland will welcome the notice of motion about the New Valuation List Order. About three years ago there was a review of the rating valuations for business premises across Northern Ireland. This review was conducted after a 21-year gap. The result for many retail businesses, particularly in district and regional towns, has been, in many cases, catastrophic.</p>
<p>Some people experienced a doubling of their rates bill &mdash; some high street retailers experienced a trebling of their rates bill. Many of them have gone out of business. Many high street businesses, particularly the small independent retailers, felt that the last revaluation worked to their detriment. I agree with the Minister that it was imbalanced. Some retailers benefited, but others, particularly those in the high-street-independent-retailer category, suffered. I welcome the statement, and I urge the Minister and his officials to expedite this matter. It is just a pity that we have to wait until 2003.</p>
<p>I welcome the fact that there will be a five-year revaluation cycle in Northern Ireland similar to that in Great Britain. Many retailers will look forward to that, particularly those in smaller towns.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.8.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90110" speakername="Mr Jim Shannon" time="16:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#8">
<p>This is a golden opportunity to look at the revaluation of non-domestic properties especially in light of the white paper &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s notification document &mdash; circulating around the councils. While, ostensibly the paper is only for notification purposes, it is timely in that it focuses attention on the need to reconsider valuations in rural communities throughout the Province. Would the Minister shed some light on that?</p>
<p>I want to highlight the plight and the importance of rural post offices and village shops. The white paper indicates that across the water a 50% reduction in rates is being considered because of the community aspect of some businesses. We should look very seriously at the needs of post offices and small shops, and the community roles they play in villages in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The proposed 8% regional increase has many of those in small shops and post offices carefully considering their futures. For many of them, the increase will be too much to bear and some will probably go to the wall. That will have a direct impact on our rural communities, especially villages that have the post office or the small shop at their centres. They provide a great service to the local community and while they do not make a lot of money &mdash; they never will because they do not have sufficient numbers of people &mdash; they do provide something that is valuable. We must also look at the fierce competition from the large superstores. Not everyone can travel, and for some people the post office and small shop are an integral part of their lives. The Assembly took a unanimous decision to support rural post offices because Members also believe that there is a tangible benefit for the whole community</p>
<p>Across the water, people are looking at a 50% rate reduction. I ask the Minister to look seriously at that as an option for post offices and shops thereby breathing life back into villages where problems of increasing overheads press on them. Many look upon the spectre of a regional rate increase as the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>As elected representatives &mdash; especially those of us who represent country areas such as the Ards Peninsula, where post offices and small shop are an integral part of the community &mdash; we need to help our constituents. This is the opportunity to do that, and I ask the Minister to consider a 50% reduction &mdash; the same as that proposed across the water. That would represent a shot in the arm and breathe life back into the villages we represent.</p>

<p>If we are going to continue with a rating system then, on principle, revaluation should be as often as humanly practical so as to avoid the type of distortions that resulted from the 21-year gap prior to the last one. If we are going to continue with the rating system &mdash; and I understand from the Minister&rsquo;s comments that the whole system would, and should, be subject to an early review &mdash; I would question the timing of this revaluation.</p>
<p>If we are to embark on a review of the overall rating system, could those resources be used to restructure the system to provide something more effective? I accept that the purpose of revaluation is to remove distortions and give better equity between properties. Domestic properties were ignored in the last revaluation. Is there not an opportunity here? If we are to continue with rating, why were domestic properties excluded again? The level of distortion will be aggravated because of the 30-year gap since revaluation was last carried out on domestic properties.</p>
<p>I sympathise with Mr Shannon&rsquo;s comments about how we protect the lifeblood of the smaller shopkeeper, rural post offices and so forth throughout Northern Ireland. I would extend this to our towns and cities. High street retail was one of the sectors that suffered most dramatically from the last revaluation. As has been mentioned, the result was that many premises were vacated. We do not want our towns to turn into ghost towns or huge office blocks. We must do our utmost to encourage people to have a proper retail mix in our towns and city centres; otherwise we may destroy the entire fabric of society in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, over a number of years we have been slipping towards that. Drive through any of our main provincial towns, say Lisburn, which is the jewel in the crown of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s shopping centres, and what you see are numerous &quot;for let&quot; and &quot;for sale&quot; signs. This is solely due to excessive rents and excessive rates. The offshoot of this is that a proper retail mix is gradually being eroded from our towns and cities.</p>
<p>Over the past five years food stores have suffered the greatest change in their history. We now have the Sainsburys and the Tescos in Northern Ireland. Presumably, they escaped the last dramatic shift. There was no real basis to hang their rentals on, so this time there will be a considerable battle with the large superstores. The impact that this will have on shopping is something that must be seriously considered.</p>
<p>We must try to expedite the rates evaluation. Is it the best way to attract income? We need to eliminate the current distortions, and I question whether rates are the best way to do this.</p>

<p>Mr Close referred to Lisburn as the premier shopping town, but surely Lurgan and Portadown are in the same category.</p>
<p>Many shops in our towns are lying empty, and empty shops are of no use to towns or to ratepayers. We must try to encourage our shopkeepers. If we burden them with high rates, it becomes impossible for them to exist.</p>
<p>I represent a rural area, and this has highlighted for me the fact that people in those areas must travel to towns to get what they need. For example, our small post office has closed &mdash; it is very difficult for small branches to compete with the bigger post offices in the town that have so many services to offer their customers.</p>
<p>I welcome the statement that there will be a review every five years. That is long overdue.</p>
<p>It worries me that people in rural areas are being deprived of many of the services that are available in towns. I hope that the various authorities will take this point on board.</p>
<p>There are many derelict shops and houses across the country, and this is of grave concern. This is a sore point and a big drawback to any society. I hope that in the coming months and years a rebate will be introduced to encourage people to renovate derelict properties so that they are fit to be lived in again. Peace has taken its grip on our community, but these areas have endured a good deal of torment and turmoil over the last 10 or 15 years, and due consideration must be given to the houses there.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.8.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90105" speakername="Mr Peter Robinson" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#8">
<p>Any subject matter brought to the House by the Minister of Finance that touches on the issue of rates will get the attention not only of Assembly Members but, more importantly, of a very large section of our community. Few people are not impacted in one way or another by the level of their rates bills. Over recent days the intention to have a substantial increase in the regional rate has brought stories to many of us, particularly from shopkeepers and small businesses. They face very real hardship as a result of what will be small changes to the Northern Ireland Budget overall but which will mark very large changes to their normal business cash flow.</p>
<p>When we talk about reviewing the valuation list, we talk about the potential to put people out of work. I am not sure how the Minister&rsquo;s Colleague managed to summon the view that there is a good-news story here. In reality, as a result of this valuation list review, every one of us will have constituents coming to tell us that their rates have been hiked up very considerably. Of one thing we can be certain &mdash; those who benefit as a result of the review will not be coming to tell us about it. We will hear the sad stories in this case, and there are bound to be many.</p>
<p>I want to make a particular case &mdash; and not for jewels in the crown. Those who come to the Assembly and tell us how swimmingly things are going in Lisburn, Portadown and Lurgan obviously require less sympathy from the Minister than those of us who talk about substantial difficulties in our constituencies. Therefore the Minister needs to pay some attention to the areas where there is no glitter and very few jewels.</p>
<p>I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention, in particular, to the difficult task faced by shopkeepers in the periphery of Belfast. They are competing against large stores and businesses in Belfast city centre. Traditional shopping patterns are changing &mdash; people are going more often to out-of-town stores to pick up the week&rsquo;s groceries. The corner shop is under great pressure, yet it is a vital part of the vibrancy and integrity of the local community. The Minister should give some guidance to those who will determine the valuation and say that there must be some allowance for those who are trying to keep that part of the retail community alive in these difficult circumstances. If smaller stores are treated in the same way as Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsburys, Tesco, or Safeway, they will not get a fair deal. The whole community will have cause for regret if small corner stores go out of business, causing that part of the life of our community to die off.</p>
<p>I agree with the Minister that there should be regular reviews. There is case for regular review since this does not, in itself, set the amount that people will pay for rates &mdash; it decides the formula which will determine the apportionment of the overall rates burden that each will eventually pay. However, I agree with Colleagues that there is a good reason for holding a review of the domestic sector.</p>
<p>There have been some occasions when constituents have voiced to me their objections to their rates bill because of a change that has taken place in their area. The valuer, sent out to visit the property, has sometimes concluded that, because of a garage, extension or improvement that was not included on the original valuation, the occupant should be paying a higher rates bill. If this small number of cases is indicative of the situation in the community as a whole, significant changes are required. The rating of domestic properties would be an enormous job to undertake. Businessmen, in particular, will say that they want to have the same degree of scrutiny on all properties on the valuation list, rather than just on the non- domestic properties.</p>
<p>I trust that the Minister will look at all of these points and recognise that there is a case for small businesses, particularly shopkeepers, who have a difficult job to make ends meet in present circumstances.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-01-22.8.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010122.htm#8">
<p>I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. The motion relates to a short statutory rule, but the subject of rates and revaluation always generates great interest among Members, who are constantly alert to the interests of their constituents. I have listened with interest to the points made. They were informative and challenging, and I will try to respond to as many of them as I can.</p>
<p>Mr Byrne said that the need for timely revaluations to avoid the significant gaps and excessive changes that we have seen in the past is a key reason for supporting a revaluation now. It will mean that we will have had a revaluation after six years, rather than five. I believe that we should be moving to regular revaluation on a five-year basis. The Order does not of itself put us onto a five-year revaluation cycle; it is simply about the next revaluation. People might have had wider questions about us pre-empting the rating policy review if we had been committing ourselves fully and deliberately to a five-year cycle now. That is an issue that will obviously come up as part of the wider rating policy review, but I note the thoughts that Members have already expressed in that regard.</p>
<p>Joe Byrne is also correct in saying that the revaluation rates are based on rental values. That is something that people have views on. Many people seem to be questioning the accuracy and adequacy of the last revaluation. Independent appeals mechanisms are available. There is a common recognition that many of the valuations arising from the last revaluation have been overtaken. There have been changes in the retail geography of many towns; there are new players; and the market has changed. As a result, trading practices and customer preferences have also changed. We recognise that. Again, that is an argument for revaluation rather than against it.</p>
<p>The last time around, transitional arrangements were made when variations emerged on revaluation, and those arrangements reflected the very significant changes that some ratepayers faced. We really do not know the scale of the variations that we are going to face this time. It would be premature to say that there will be a transitional relief scheme. That is something that will need to be reviewed in light of what the revaluation yields.</p>
<p>Jim Shannon raised points that touched, in particular, on businesses in rural areas &mdash; especially post offices. He also highlighted the point that provision is being made in Great Britain for 50% rate relief for certain properties and businesses falling into a particular category. This is another area that we want to consider realistically. Legislation was passed before devolution that would provide for such a scheme here. As I indicated in a previous written answer to Sean Neeson &mdash; and I referred to it in an answer to Joan Carson as well &mdash; work has been done in relation to that legislation. There are issues in relation to defining the relevant areas and the businesses that would qualify. There are still a number of outstanding points, in relation to implementing the legislation, which I want to consider.</p>
<p>Members are aware that I have announced &mdash; it is in the Programme for Government &mdash; that there will be a wider rating policy review, the details of which I will be bringing forward soon. I am not convinced that it would be fair to simply leave the question of making targeted relief available until the rating policy review, because the rating policy review will itself take some time to bring forward results. I will be considering the matter further to see what we can do in relation to the existing legislative provisions.</p>
<p>Seamus Close raised a number of points. He stressed his belief that if we are going to have rates, and therefore revaluations, those revaluations should be as regular as is practicable. He also raised the point that a general rating review would perhaps be preferable to the revaluation. We are having a wider review of rating policy, but, because it might take a number of years for results and decisions to come through from that review, it would be advisable to proceed with non-domestic revaluation now.</p>
<p>If people recognise timely revaluation as important, we should not delay it simply because we are having the wider review. It makes sense to proceed with the revaluation and the wider review. The wider review may confirm that we will still have non-domestic rates &mdash; just as there was when changes were made to the rates systems elsewhere. For instance, when domestic rates where abolished in the South, non-domestic rates were retained. Equally, across the water, when rates gave way to the poll tax &mdash; quickly followed by the council tax &mdash; non- domestic rates were retained.</p>
<p>It would not be appropriate to suspend any move on revaluation until we had the wider review, not least because many Members are saying that current revaluations are out of sync with current rental values and real market factors. If that adjustment is needed, and revaluation needs to take place, then we should not be making excuses to avoid it. If I were delaying revaluation pending the review, more questions would have been raised about that approach than the one we are currently adopting.</p>
<p>Mr Close referred to the impact on the retail sector, particularly by the big multiples that have come here. There has been a significant change in retail geography since the last revaluation, which, again, underpins the case for such a revaluation &mdash; a point further reinforced by Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson.</p>
<p>While not taking issue with those who emphasised the needs of people in small towns and rural areas, this also served to highlight some of what are regarded as urban discrepancies in relation to current valuation patterns. Many small shops and businesses in urban areas, particularly those in the penumbra of the bigger cities, face particular difficulties and challenges. That is why revaluation should be seen as a positive exercise. If people feel that they are suffering under excessive valuations at present, then they should welcome a revaluation.</p>
<p>Mr Robinson said that the point of a revaluation is not to set about increasing the overall yield from rates &mdash; that yield is determined by our spending needs. It redistributes the overall rates burden in line with current property values. In that way it is actually a re-balancing exercise. Revaluation should address the imbalances that people tell me are already building up as a result of differential levels of rental growth, and, it is to be hoped, prevent other imbalances arising. The revaluation will come into force on 1 April 2003, and the new rateable values will be based on rental values as at 1 April 2001.</p>
<p>I should point out that in the last revaluation, the overall increase in total value was 630%, with a corresponding reduction in average rate poundage from ¬£2¬∑50 to ¬£0¬∑40. Other things being equal, an average increase in total value of 25% should see average rate poundages falling back to around the ¬£0¬∑40 mark again. I hope that that clarifies for Members that this exercise is not about trying to increase the rate burden overall on small businesses, or anyone else, it is about trying to achieve a more equitable distribution of that rate burden.</p>

<p>The motion is about the appointment of an Ad Hoc Committee to consider a draft Life Sentence Order. The point I simply want to make &mdash; perhaps not quite as briefly as the proposer of the motion &mdash; is that for someone within the DUP to not merely propose such an Ad Hoc Committee but that such a Committee should include members of Sinn F√©in is entirely incongruous. The proposal effectively legitimises the role of a political party inextricably linked to a terrorist organisation in the consideration of a matter of a delicate legality. In the process of doing that, it entirely legitimises the functions of that party within the Assembly by another party. <i>[Interruption]</i></p>

<p>On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. First, the Member is not speaking to the motion. Secondly, it is worth noting that it was the Business Committee that decided who should propose this motion. The Member is out of order. If his party had a representative on the Business Committee, he would know that.</p>

<p>I reject the allegation. We are here to discuss whether or not we should have such a Committee. I am making an argument against it. Even if the Business Committee decided who was going to put forward the motion, we are all free agents in the Assembly. We can say &quot;I am not prepared to put forward that sort of a motion. It is entirely incompatible with the position I have put to my electorate. I am actually opposed to, prepared to face down, and give no legitimacy to, a political organisation fronting a terrorist organisation responsible for high levels of criminality for 30 years.&quot; <i>[Interruption]</i></p>

<p>I do not wish to continue the debate. I have made my point. I am quite sure that the deputy leader of that party will no doubt be indulging in a bit of fancy political footwork, in that platform piece in the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo;, to try to persuade his electorate, that this is what he was actually voted to do.</p>

<p>I do not know whether to laugh at what has just preceded or cry at the tragedy that someone &mdash; for whom I have a lot of respect, and we agree on many things &mdash; puts such efforts into what is really an issue of such triviality. It really beggars belief. When we usually agree on so much, to find him using this tactic really strikes at the lowest level. I urge the Member and his colleagues &mdash; whoever or whatever is putting them up to this &mdash; to resist and join with us in our efforts to try to speak on behalf of those in the majority of the Unionist community &mdash; <i>[Interruption]</i></p>

<p>I did not interrupt the previous Member, and I hope that I will be given the same courtesy. We presently have the support of, I think, the majority of the Unionist community by reflecting disillusionment in the way in which the Belfast Agreement has been implemented and opposing the agreement itself. I hope that the Members will join with us if what they say is their main objective is, indeed, their main objective. Some of the things that they say and do run counter to that.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Someone drew your attention to the fact that Mr Roche departed from the issue, and you ruled that that was incorrect. Mr Dodds is well off the mark now. He should remember that he does have a pledge with the electorate &mdash; the united Unionist pledge to oppose the Belfast Agreement.</p>

<p>Once again, Cedric has got it wrong. Membership of the House&rsquo;s statutory Committees is also decided on a proportional basis and includes Sinn F√©in. Members of Mr Wilson&rsquo;s party sat on that Committee, agreed with that and proposed that. They are being hypocritical by alleging that we agreed something different.</p>

<p>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am happy to do that.</p>
<p>As has been mentioned, this is a technical motion, which has been agreed by the Business Committee. When we come to examine the issue, we will debate it properly in the House and give our views. Instead of occasionally coming to the House to rail against things, it would be far better if the Member and his party helped the rest of us so that we can actually promote the Unionist cause. <i>[Interruption]</i> Because he has been hit hard, the Member continues to interrupt.</p>

<p>Clearly, when points that hit home are made, some Members do not like it and cannot take it. The reality is that the Members concerned come into this Assembly. Their remarks about sitting in Committee apply equally to sitting in the Assembly, because members of Sinn F√©in / IRA sit in the Chamber. They sit happily here, but for some reason they cannot sit on a Committee. They will explain their own reasons.</p>
<p>However, if they did sit on Committees, including this Committee &mdash; <i>[Interruption]. </i>I wish the Member would calm down. It is obviously hitting home. If they did that they would help the Unionist cause. He could ensure that there was a strong Unionist majority on those Committees, but his current activities ensure that places on those Committees go by default to Sinn F√©in / IRA. He is assisting Sinn F√©in / IRA by not taking a seat on the scrutiny Committees. The reality &mdash;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. This is the same nonsense that the DUP put forward when it took its ministerial positions. It said that if that if it did not take its ministerial positions they would go to Sinn F√©in and the SDLP. The same bunkum &mdash;</p>

<p>I am surprised that Mr Wilson could not refer to the relevant Standing Order.
