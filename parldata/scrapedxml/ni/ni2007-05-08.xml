<p>In a letter dated 7 May 2007, the Secretary of State has notified me that he has made a restoration order under section 2(2) of the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006. The restoration order lifts the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and effects the restoration of devolved Government in Northern Ireland today.</p>

<p>Under the legislation, I became Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly this morning. However, I do believe that it is important that the Assembly should have an early opportunity to elect a Speaker from among its Members.</p>
<p>I remind Members that the election of the Speaker will be conducted using the procedures set out in Standing Order 4, as follows.</p>
<p>I will begin by asking for nominations. Any Member may rise to propose that another Member be elected as Speaker. I will then ask for the proposal to be seconded by another Member, as required by Standing Order 14. If that occurs, I will then verify that the Member so nominated is willing to accept the nomination. There will not be an opportunity for speeches at that stage.</p>
<p>I shall then ask for further proposals and follow the same procedure for each. When it appears that there are no further proposals, I will make it clear that the time for proposals has passed. A debate relevant to the election may then take place, in which no Member shall speak more than once.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the debate, or at the conclusion of the nominations if there are no requests to speak, I shall put the Question that the Member first proposed shall be Speaker of this Assembly. Such a vote can be carried only on a cross-community basis. If the proposal is not carried, I shall put the Question in relation to the next nominee, and so on, until all nominations are exhausted. Once a Speaker is elected, all other nominations will automatically fall.</p>
<p>If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
<p>Do I have any proposals for the office of Speaker of this Assembly?</p>

<p>Madam Speaker, we appreciate <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">all that you have done in presiding over our Assemblies</span>. As you look down at these Benches, you will have some peculiar thoughts. Perhaps some day we will be privileged to read what you thought of the people that you looked upon so carefully and affectionately. You had a difficult time, and it was a difficult time for the Assembly. Nevertheless, you kept a grip on business, with the necessary leniency; yet you kept aright the standards of debate. We are grateful to you for that. You can look ahead with no doubt that you did well, because you never had to order any Member out of the House.</p>

<p>Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, I join with other Members in thanking you for your courtesy and the manner in which you have conducted our business over some very difficult times. At every occasion you extended every courtesy to us, and, as other Members have said, I know how difficult we can be at times. At all times you kept a sense of humour and occasion, and we are grateful to you for carrying on well beyond the point at which you could easily have relieved yourself of the burden of office.</p>
<p>Like the previous Member, I place on record the UUP&rsquo;s deep regret at the very sad news of the death of one of our Members, George Dawson, which overshadows today&rsquo;s proceedings. To his family, and colleagues in the Democratic Unionist Party, we extend our deepest sympathies.</p>

<p>Madam Speaker, on behalf of the SDLP, I join with the leaders of other parties in thanking you for your contribution in the office of Speaker. You have displayed courtesy, good character and not a little charm during something of a political twilight zone in which we operated during the past few months. Prior to that, you made a very distinctive contribution in the Assembly. You leave with our thanks &mdash; not only for your role as Speaker but for your contribution as a fellow Member of the Assembly.</p>
<p>I, too, extend sympathy to the Dawson family, George&rsquo;s friends and his party colleagues on his untimely death. George had a very distinctive economic insight, and the new Assembly, on this important day, will be the poorer for his absence.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2007-05-08.5.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90280" speakername="David Ford" time="10:30" url="">
<p>I echo the comments made about the passing of George Dawson. On behalf of my party and all my colleagues, I express sympathy to Mrs Dawson, his party colleagues and to the wider family circle. As Mark Durkan has just said, during last summer he made an enormous contribution in the Preparation for Government Committee in preparing the ground for the economic work to be done. We will at least have his legacy in that respect.</p>
<p>I echo the sentiments of other Members in expressing thanks to Madam Speaker Bell. I may have worked rather longer with Eileen Bell than have others, but on this occasion I, and my colleagues, want to thank you for what you did. It was a thankless task to preside over the Transitional Assembly.</p>
<p>It was not only Members in this Chamber who gave you problems at times; you were presented with problems from a wide range of circumstances. However, you dealt with them all with good humour and your customary courtesy and charm. You ensured that everything that could be done to defend the integrity of this Assembly was done. Madam Speaker, on behalf of my group, I thank you, and the staff who worked with you, for all that you have achieved, and I wish you and Derek well in the years ahead.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Progressive Unionist Party, I wish to express our condolences on the death of George Dawson and extend our sympathies to his family.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, there were times when it has been difficult for you over the last couple of years, but you embraced your role with your usual enthusiasm and courage. On behalf of our party, I thank you, and I wish you well in your retirement. I know that you will indulge all your many passions, including fashion, golf, and so on. I wish you well for your retirement.</p>

<p>I would like to propose Mr William Hay. It gives me very great pleasure to nominate Mr Hay from the Foyle constituency to be the first elected Speaker of the Assembly.</p>
<p>It is fitting to say some brief words about him. I have known the Hay family for far too long to want to remember how long ago I met him &mdash; he was a young boy in short pants at that time. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> He came to prominence through his mother, Anna Margaret Hay, who was the first ever DUP elected representative in County Londonderry. This is a proud day for the Hay family, and it honours the memory of their mother.</p>
<p>At the last election, William performed the remarkable feat of topping the poll in an overwhelmingly nationalist constituency &mdash; with all due respect to my Friend, the leader of the SDLP. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> It is not often that that happens. William is well regarded by unionists and non-unionists, and I welcome the opportunity to put him forward. I acknowledge that at the next Assembly election, we will support a candidate drawn from the other side of the House. Of course, that will rest with the people because we will go back to the people for new mandates. However, all things considered, if we do well we will support someone from the other side of the House in the next Parliament. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for your leniency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2007-05-08.5.16" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90241" speakername="Madam Speaker" time="10:30" url="">
<p>I formally declare that Mr William Hay has been elected as Speaker.</p>
<p>With the Assembly&rsquo;s indulgence, before I vacate the Chair for the last time, I would like to make a few personal remarks.</p>
<p>When I first took up the position of Speaker, I confessed to Members that I considered it a rather daunting task. Facing one&rsquo;s peers in such a formal and unique role brings many challenges, and I was anxious to ensure that I conducted myself in a manner that reflected the importance of the office.</p>
<p>Looking back over the past year, I want to place on record my sincere thanks to Members for the co-operation and goodwill that they extended to me from the outset, and which has continued to this day. That goodwill has enabled us all to overcome each and every challenge. My thanks also go to my two Deputy Speakers for the support that they have given to me and to the Assembly as a whole.</p>
<p>I also wish to express my thanks to, and admiration for, all the staff of the Assembly secretariat. The position of Speaker offers an opportunity to observe in much greater detail the lengths to which our secretariat officials go to serve the Assembly, and, throughout my time in office, their commitment and loyalty to me personally has made my task a great deal easier.</p>
<p>Members will know that my desire has always been to see a stable, devolved Assembly in Northern Ireland, working for the best interests of everyone. As I leave office, my hope is that today heralds the beginning of such an Assembly, and it has been my privilege to play some small part in achieving that.</p>
<p>Although, as I said, I considered the role of Speaker to be a daunting task, on taking up the office, I chose as my personal motto to paraphrase that of the Special Olympics: I hope to succeed, but if I do not, I will be brave in the attempt. I hope that I have lived up to that standard.</p>
<p>To the Assembly, to each of its Members, and, in particular, to my successor, I offer my very best wishes as you set about the task for which you have been elected.</p>
<p>I now invite the Speaker to take the Chair, and I will hand over the Assembly&rsquo;s gavel as a symbol of the office of Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
<p class="italic">[Applause.]</p>

<p>Before I call the next item of business, I take this opportunity to thank Members for electing me to the position of Speaker. As I take the Chair, I am conscious of the role played by past Speakers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I express my own regard for the manner in which the outgoing Speaker conducted herself in what was, for all Members, an often challenging and unusual situation.</p>
<p>I find myself in the position of being the first Speaker to have been elected directly by the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is, indeed, a privilege, but one that carries with it a considerable burden. In electing me, Members have placed their trust in me and in my ability to maintain the authority and impartiality so essential to the office of Speaker. I will strive to uphold thosevalues, and I will seek to act at all times as a servant of the Assembly as a whole.</p>
<p>The authority of, and respect for, the office of Speaker is drawn from the Members themselves and the co-operation that they offer to the office. I trust that that respect and co-operation will be forthcoming, as it has been in the past, and that together we will fulfil the responsibilities placed on all of us, with mutual respect. To that end, we shall now proceed.</p>

<p>The next item of business is the affirmation of the terms of the Pledge of Office for the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate). In a letter dated 3 May 2007, the Secretary of State advised the former Speaker that he had received official confirmation from Dr Paisley and Mr McGuinness that they had accepted their parties&rsquo; nominations to be First Minister and Deputy First Minister respectively.</p>
<p>Members will be aware that the legislation provides that the persons nominated shall not take up office until each of them has affirmed the terms of the Pledge of Office contained in schedule 4 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, Members may find it helpful if the Pledge of Office is read into the record so that it does not have to be read in full by the First Minister (Designate), the Deputy First Minister (Designate) or by other Ministers as they take up office.</p>
<p>The Pledge of Office is as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;To pledge: </p>
<p class="indent">(a) to discharge in good faith all the duties of office;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) commitment to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) to serve all the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the general obligations on government to promote equality and prevent discrimination;</p>
<p class="indent">(ca) to promote the interests of the whole community represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly towards the goal of a shared future;</p>
<p class="indent">(cb) to participate fully in the Executive Committee, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council;</p>
<p class="indent">(cc) to observe the joint nature of the offices of First Minister and deputy First Minister;</p>
<p class="indent">(cd) to uphold the rule of law based as it is on the fundamental principles of fairness, impartiality and democratic accountability, including support for policing and the courts as set out in paragraph 6 of the St Andrews Agreement;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) to participate with colleagues in the preparation of a programme for government;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) to operate within the framework of that programme when agreed within the Executive Committee and endorsed by the Assembly;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) to support, and act in accordance with, all decisions of the Executive Committee and Assembly;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) to comply with the Ministerial Code of Conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paragraph 6 of the St Andrews Agreement says:</p>
<p class="indent">&ldquo;We believe that the essential elements of support for law and order include endorsing fully the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the criminal justice system, actively encouraging everyone in the community to co-operate fully with the PSNI in tackling crime in all areas and actively supporting all the policing and criminal justice institutions, including the Policing Board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we go through the processes, I am sure that all Members will co-operate. I wish to say to people in the Public Gallery that, with the day that is in it and with the death of a Member of the Assembly, applause would not be appropriate.</p>
<p>The next item of business is the appointment of Ministers. I will conduct the process for filling those offices in accordance with the procedure set out in section 18 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. I wish to remind Members of the requirements set out in the Act.</p>
<p>I shall ask the nominating officer of each political party in the order required by the formula contained in section 18(5) to select an available ministerial office and nominate a person to hold it who is a member of his party and a Member of the Assembly.</p>
<p>I therefore call on the Rt Hon Dr Ian Paisley, as nominating officer of the political party for which the formula laid down in section 18 gives the highest figure, to select a ministerial office and nominate a person to hold it who is a member of his party and a Member of the Assembly.</p>
