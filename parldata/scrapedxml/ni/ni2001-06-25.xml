<p>I confirm to the House that, in accordance with Standing Order 40(2), I have been notified by the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel that the Committee is satisfied that there has been appropriate consultation with it on the public expenditure proposals contained in the Budget (No 2) Bill. The Bill may therefore proceed under the accelerated passage procedure without a vote.</p>
<p>I remind the House that the Second Stage of this Bill, as with that of any other Bill, is an opportunity to debate the broad principles of the Bill and not an occasion for detailed debate on other sundry matters.</p>

<p>I beg to move</p>
<p class="small">That the Second Stage of the Budget (No 2) Bill (NIA 17/00) be agreed.</p>
<p>The debate follows on from the Bill&rsquo;s First Stage last Tuesday and the Supply resolution for the 2001-02 Main Estimates that was considered on Monday 18 June. The purpose of the Budget (No 2) Bill is to give legislative effect to the resource Estimates that were approved through the Supply resolution that was passed last Monday.</p>
<p>Given the wide-ranging and valuable debate then, I do not intend to detain the House with unnecessary repetition of the detail implicit in the spending authorisation contained in the Bill. I gave much of that detail last week. However, I will summarise the main features of the Bill in accordance with the nature of the Second Stage debate as envisaged under Standing Order 30.</p>
<p class="italic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the Chair)</p>
<p>The principle of the Bill is to authorise the use of resources totalling £5,021,262,000 by Departments and the issue of £4,679,167,000 from the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund in respect of the Main Estimates for 2001-02. Members received copies of the detailed Main Estimates booklet on Monday 11 June.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the Committee for Finance and Personnel for the attention that it has given, and continues to give, to matters of public expenditure and related procedural issues. I am also grateful for the confirmation from Mr Molloy, Chairperson of the Committee, that there has been appropriate consultation on the public expenditure proposals contained in the Bill, as set out in his letter to the Speaker dated 18 June.</p>
<p>This is the first full year in which Budget allocations will be determined and managed on a resource basis. Aside from the technical dimension of that, the transition involves the introduction of several new terms. Most of those were covered in the Vote on Account process in the Budget Bill in February. However, the Budget (No 2) Bill introduces an additional new term &mdash; &quot;accruing resources&quot; &mdash; which represents the Departments&rsquo; receipts or income. It was known as &quot;appropriations in aid&quot; in the old cash regime. I hope that clarifies matters for Members.</p>
<p>As the Speaker has acknowledged, the Budget (No 2) Bill represents the endgame regarding the 2001-02 Budget &mdash; a process that started last year and ran from the Budget vote in December 2000 to the Supply resolution debate last Monday. The spending plans reflected in the Bill have been approved and endorsed by the Assembly, but I will be happy to deal with any points of principle that may arise.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.2.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90087" speakername="Mr Francie Molloy" speakeroffice="The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel" time="12:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#2">
<p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister of Finance and Personnel presented the draft Budget for 2001-02 on 17 October 2000. That was followed by a substantive Budget debate on 14 November and by the final Budget debate on 18 December. A sequence of events was involved. It really comes down to the question of whether the Assembly was given sufficient opportunity to properly consider the Bill&rsquo;s implications and, if not, whether there is sufficient justification for proceeding in the absence of such consideration.</p>
<p>The Committee for Finance and Personnel is concerned that, due to the Westminster and local government elections, there has been limited time for Assembly Committees to have had appropriate opportunity to analyse the Estimates and to discuss them with their respective Ministers. In more normal circumstances it is the duty of the Committee for Finance and Personnel to ensure that all the Committees&rsquo; views on the financial provision proposed for the various Departments are co-ordinated and brought before the Assembly.</p>
<p>Clearly it is not possible to have such a properly informed debate on the Estimates for the current year. However, the Minister of Finance and Personnel kept the Committee fully informed and the Assembly updated on a regular basis on the preparation of the final version of the Estimates for 2001-02. The Finance and Personnel Committee is content that the requirements of Standing Order 40 for appropriate consultation have been fully met and that it is in order for the Budget (No 2) Bill to proceed. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.2.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90080" speakername="Mr Eddie McGrady" time="12:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#2">
<p>The Budget debate in any legislature is an important event. The Budget dictates how we will govern ourselves. It has a tremendous effect on the lives of our constituents, the economy and social well-being.</p>
<p>At this stage of the Bill it is possible to deal only with very general terms. Notwithstanding that, it is evident that the total amount of money we can spend is determined by our income and not by our expenditure. It is almost a self-evident truth that our income in this case is capped by the grant-in-aid received from the Exchequer.</p>
<p>We know from previous Assembly debates that we have cross-party agreement that the amount of grant-in-aid is inadequate. Its inadequacy has been exposed more and more in our experiences over the past two years. Each time we look at a departmental budget we see deficiencies, not in the work that is being carried out, but in the inability to have the money to do further things.</p>
<p>On previous occasions the Minister has indicated to the Assembly the urgent work he is doing with the other Ministers and with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister regarding the famous &mdash; or now infamous &mdash; Barnett formula, which dictates in many ways how we govern in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>I would like the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that those negotiations, which we all hope will go to a higher level, are now well progressed. Perhaps he could give us some indication as to whether there is a willingness on the part of central Government to redress the inadequacies of the Barnett formula and also to take on board the problems we are having by the revelations that each Department makes to the Assembly.</p>
<p>We have only to look at the Department of the Environment and its Committee to see huge deficits in water and sewerage provision, roads provision, hospital provision and adequate medical and surgical training.</p>
<p>Those deficits have come about as a result of inadequate expenditure in previous years. It is estimated that there has been underspending on our infrastructure and on our primary resources of health and education for almost the entire period of direct rule. That being the case, it is surely a sound and valid argument that that deficit should be restored from a top-up; not from current restricted financing. A top-up would enable us to recover and address that inadequacy in these major issues.</p>
<p>Infrastructure is not a word that excites the ordinary man and woman in the street, but if you do not have infrastructure you cannot progress as a society, you cannot sustain industrial development, and you cannot attract inward investment. All those things impinge directly on the educational prospects &mdash; and the healthcare, moreover &mdash; of every man, woman, and child in our community.</p>
<p>We have had a series of almost catastrophic events that were never envisaged in the Barnett formula. Some of those were in agriculture &mdash; the BSE crisis, the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and the threat of the run-down of our fishing industry. Those three major crisis areas in agriculture were not provided for by the formula used to give us our financing.</p>
<p>Looking at the other Departments, £60 million is required for sewerage and £100 million for infrastructure. Those are major issues that need consideration. I doubt that the current Budget can properly address our ongoing plans. However, those will have to be addressed now or in the immediate future. I am talking about matters such as the recent Hayes Report which, if it is accepted, predicates a huge investment in hospital infrastructure and medical services. We do not have adequate resources to meet that need.</p>
<p>The only alternative to the capped Barnett formula spending is to use direct taxation, which is a dirty word because it always means increasing taxes. The Scottish Parliament has a direct taxation revenue-raising power of up to three pence in the pound. We do not have that power, and I am not arguing that we should have that facility. However, because of the strictness of our current grant-in-aid controls we will have to review the existing arrangements or look at alternatives. There is a great reluctance &mdash; understandably and sometimes justifiably &mdash; among all Assembly parties to increase direct or indirect taxation, even in the form of licences. In the next two days that issue may crop up. All parties bitterly oppose minuscule increases in licensing fees, and that indicates that, even if we had direct taxation, we would not be able to use it. In the meantime, we must tailor our Budget and our commitment to economic and social development to the resources available.</p>
<p>Another huge area coming up is the recovery of the agriculture industry and its knock-on effect in tourism, which has faced horrendous problems in many areas of Northern Ireland. South Down has suffered a triple whammy as regards tourism, agriculture and fishing, with no apparent real moneys being directed to those problems. I hope that special extra funding will be directed from the Executive to address those issues.</p>
<p>In the area of fishing alone, the Irish Government have made an additional £20 million available for the improvement of their fishing fleet while we are decreasing the capacity of our fishing fleet. I do not want to labour that issue.</p>
<p>We have the question of building new maternity hospitals, which was debated on the radio this morning. Where is the money coming from for such projects? These are real issues that any debate needs to address, because unless we can make a change in our economic and social well-being &mdash; a change in the fabric of our society &mdash; then our efforts in relation to our devolved responsibilities are brought to nought by lack of finance.</p>
<p>The Minister, in his opening remarks, said that I would fully understand the meaning of the term &quot;accruing resources&quot;, because it is a substitution for &quot;appropriation in aid&quot;. I do not know what &quot;appropriation in aid&quot; is, so perhaps he would explain that phrase also.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.2.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90090" speakername="Ms Jane Morrice" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#2">
<p>We are very grateful for the opportunity to consult at this important stage of the Budget. As well as talking about the overall principles, I would like to look in some detail at certain areas we would like to see underlined in the Budget.</p>
<p>I begin with one of the Assembly&rsquo;s most important considerations &mdash; the future of our children. We hope to see plans for a children&rsquo;s commissioner coming on-stream in the next year. Can the Minister tell us what plans have been made for additional expenditure for that purpose? Which Department &mdash; or Departments, as we are talking about joined-up government &mdash; will have responsibility for the office, and how will that be reflected in future Budgets?</p>
<p>There is recognition of the importance of research and statistics as a firm foundation on which to base future policy analyses. Through the many parliamentary questions that we have asked this year, we have ascertained that there are no available statistics on some topics, such as, for example, the number of children living in poverty. It is unfortunate that such statistics do not exist. In order to fine-tune policies, as the Executive suggested in their position report to the Assembly for the Programme for Government, we need high-quality, relevant and accurate information.</p>
<p>We are disappointed that, apart from specific funding for the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, only the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment has allowed for departmental research and development. Although the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has the Industrial Research and Technology Unit, other Departments, such as those responsible for the social development and health budgets, should be explicitly prioritising research moneys. Will the Minister look into the level of each Department&rsquo;s research budget and tell us what the budget accommodation is?</p>
<p>The Bill does not show the amount of money to be spent on private finance initiatives (PFIs) and how they deliver public services. As we have asked before, does the Executive accept that if they continue to pursue expenditure by private means, they are mortgaging our children&rsquo;s future? Spending money on private firms now means that we have to pay it back later and, it is accepted, with a great deal of interest. What percentage of money does the Bill allocate to private companies, and what will the repayment be? We would appreciate a response to these questions. We do not believe that private finance represents value for money for our people today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>I also want to talk about economic issues. What is the Minister doing to accommodate the recommendations made by the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment on the &lsquo;Strategy 2010&rsquo; report concerning tax? A number of our recommendations favour helping the economy to grow and become stronger through initiatives, tax breaks or other imaginative ways. Are those recommendations being accommodated? If so, what is being done through the Budget to implement proposals such as tax breaks for the creative industries, greater support for the social economy or the needs of small business?</p>
<p>The euro is one of my own areas of interest. As we all know, the euro will be in place and in the pockets of people south of the border. What moneys will be set aside to help Northern Ireland&rsquo;s small businesses manage the position they will find themselves in? Will there be a proposal to help small businesses give their prices in euros as well as pounds? What initiatives are there?</p>
<p>I want to raise a point that was brought to me by trade unions about the minimum wage. The Assembly supported the £5 minimum wage, and it is hoped that legislation will be introduced in the near future to accommodate the pressure from the Assembly on that. What is the Minister doing in the Budget to prepare for that legislation?</p>
<p>Childcare is of great interest to the Women&rsquo;s Coalition. What provision is in the Budget for subsidies for childcare places and for accommodating the parental leave measures that will come in through legislation in Brussels and London?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.2.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90075" speakername="Mr Donovan McClelland" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#2">
<p>This is the Second Stage of the debate on the Budget (No 2) Bill &mdash; it is not an opportunity to rerun the supply debate of last week. In a Second Stage debate we discuss the principles and philosophy of a Bill, not its specific terms. Members had the opportunity to raise such points in the supply debate. Please bear that in mind.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.2.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90090" speakername="Ms Jane Morrice" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#2">
<p>I take the point. I will conclude my remarks without going into too much detail, but I thought it important to raise those points for the Minister to consider.</p>
<p>My final point concerns peace building, which also concerns the future of our children. How can individual Departments, and the Executive as a whole, lead on issues such as challenging sectarianism? Although we are emerging from conflict, we still live in a deeply divided society. There should be an extensive programme to combat sectarianism in schools, community centres and at all levels of society.</p>
<p>Political leaders can lead from the front by example. However, those leaders should look to the examples of women&rsquo;s groups and trade unions that have done so much work and have such expertise in that area. Will the Executive consider, and respond to, the money that has been set aside for developing a strategy on community relations, anti-sectarianism and questions that we have on race and ethnicity?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.2.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90036" speakername="Mr Nigel Dodds" time="12:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#2">
<p>This is a Second Stage debate, and we on this side want to come back to some of the issues at Consideration Stage and perhaps thereafter.</p>
<p>The Budget (No 2) Bill carries on from the previous Budget Bill and earlier Supply resolutions. As this is the Second Stage, we do not intend to divide the House today. We will consider the detail of the various appropriations contained in the draft legislation. We have no difficulty whatsoever with many of them, many of which are, necessarily and rightly, in general form. However, there are issues that concern us and should concern us, especially Members on this side of the House.</p>
<p>For example, the Minister and other Members will not be surprised that we will not forget or run away from expenditure under the Department of Finance and Personnel on, for instance, the North/South Ministerial Council, the various all-Ireland bodies and other areas, such as the Civic Forum. Our party will return to those issues later.</p>
<p>I want to put on record that our position in the House today does not in any way diminish our opposition to those areas of expenditure where we believe that the allocation of money does not represent good value for the people of Northern Ireland. The allocated money is being spent on a political project and not on delivering real and substantive benefits to the people on the ground on both sides. For instance, after a considerable period, many people still wonder exactly what the Civic Forum is supposed to be doing for its money.</p>
<p>We will return to those issues later. It would not be appropriate to go into them in detail at this stage, especially in the light of your earlier ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I want to put the Minister on notice about them.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.2.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90032" speakername="Mr John Dallat" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#2">
<p>My contribution concerns a fairly small but important element of the Budget. I pay tribute to the Minister for his co-operation in ensuring that the requirements of the Government Resources and Accounts Act (Northern Ireland) 2001 have been taken fully into account. Resource accounting is a new concept that takes the presentation of accounts away from simple receipts and payments. It enables Members to have a much more comprehensive picture of the state of the various Departments, and it is to be hoped that it will allow Members to identify areas where better use of public money can be made, where savings are possible and where additional services are feasible.</p>
<p>I speak now as an individual &mdash; lest I get into trouble &mdash; but as Chairperson of the Audit Committee, I realise that for Departments to comply with the Act will involve additional work and additional pressure. Nevertheless, it is well worthwhile. The benefits are enormous, and they will further advance the Assembly&rsquo;s impact on how public money is spent.</p>
<p>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Public Accounts Committee and, in particular, to Mr Billy Bell, although he belongs to another party. That Committee has established itself as a very reliable watchdog to ensure that the bad practices of the past are eliminated. In the proposed Bill every penny spent must be accounted for, and civil servants at all levels now realise that.</p>
<p>We hope that the dark days of direct rule are behind us. Let us hope that we never return to a situation where elected representatives are not in place to ensure that Government services are provided on a basis of best value, keeping in mind the need to target social need and test for equality.</p>
<p>In the years ahead, the services for which we are responsible can be transformed, provided that there is proper public scrutiny. It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who no longer works in isolation but, for the first time, reports to elected representatives. That exercise is working extremely well, and the public at large realise that.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all of this would not be possible if everyone were not pulling in the same direction. The Audit Committee, the Public Accounts Committee and the Finance and Personnel Committee are all co-operating in the common interests of everyone. At times that may seem strange, but it is a reality. The Minister of Finance willingly participates in a spirit of co-operation, and that is a good omen for the future. The Assembly needs to blow its own trumpet at times. It has every reason to be proud of the fundamental changes that have taken place and that will continue, provided that common sense prevails and the wreckers do not have their way.</p>

<p>Minister, you will have heard my earlier remarks that this is the Second Stage of the Budget (No 2) Bill and not an attempt to rerun previous debates. I know that you will be judicious in your response.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.2.11" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="12:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#2">
<p>I noted your earlier remarks, Mr Deputy Speaker, with some appreciation. Members need to appreciate the nature of the Budget exercise. This is obviously not an occasion when the Assembly can range freely over all the expenditure items in the budgets of the various Departments. We are trying to complete, in a competent and proper manner, the necessary procedures following the budgetary decisions made last year and approved by the Assembly.</p>
<p>On the basis of those budgetary decisions we were able to authorise expenditure in the first period of this financial year through the Vote on Account and the Budget Act (Northern Ireland) 2001. In this Bill we are authorising the rest of the expenditure for this financial year. Members want to have regard to, and Committees should ask, whether the Estimates and the Bill properly reflect those previous decisions. The fact is that they do. I know that some Members have opposed some of the provisions, but in the Budget (No 2) Bill we are doing what we are required to do, which is to provide for the competent authorisation and allocation of expenditure as already approved.</p>
<p>Some points dealt with particular areas of expenditure. I will not go into those, because those areas are not germane to today&rsquo;s exercise. On the other hand, I do not want to sidestep everything, because many Members did not address the particulars of the Bill as such, but raised wider budgetary issues.</p>
<p>As Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, Mr Molloy registered the Committee&rsquo;s concern about procedures &mdash; particularly in the longer term &mdash; and also recorded its satisfaction that there had been sufficient consultation with it to allow accelerated passage given the time constraints. I appreciate the constructive role that the Committee for Finance and Personnel has played and continues to play. On behalf of my Executive Colleagues, I want to ensure that it can continue to play and develop that constructive role, not just in its own interest but as an aid to the good work of other Committees. The Committee for Finance and Personnel has a pivotal role in ensuring that the Assembly gets proper consideration in regard to budget planning and implementation.</p>
<p>The Barnett formula falls outside the remit of the Bill per se. However, I assure the House that the Executive are well seized on that issue. Next year, in the context of the 2002 spending review, we will need to refine and articulate a strong case for revisions of the Barnett formula. It will not be a case of just asking the Treasury if it knows who is asking. There will be difficult issues, and the Executive are prepared to address them. The Executive hope that Members and Committees will be realistic about the difficulties and challenges that they face. Just as there are strong points to make, there are also strong points and questions that must be answered.</p>
<p>The point about the Barnett formula raises the issue of the adequacy of our budget, and many Members have touched on this, both today and on other occasions. As an Assembly we have already registered those questions. The Assembly needs to look not only at the question of whether it needs more money, but at the question of whether it needs to plan more wisely for the money that it has. Do we need more targeting for that money?</p>
<p>Do we need more definitive strategies to underpin our spending plans? Do we need those strategies for the discrete spending decisions at departmental and ministerial level as well as for the Executive&rsquo;s Determinations? I am concerned when there are many calls in the Assembly for more money rather than attempts being made to ensure that better use is made of the budget. We must remember that the information in the Budget (No 2) Bill and in the Estimates should not be referred to only as we go through the process of passing the Bill. Departmental Committees should use the information, together with the details in the public service agreements and the commitments in the Programme for Government, as they scrutinise the work of Departments during the year.</p>
<p>Committees can scrutinise the work of Departments in many ways. There can be more monitoring of a Department&rsquo;s performance. If there are questions about the quality of Estimates the most telling way to pursue the answers is not by considering the Budget or Budget (No 2) Bill; it is by looking at the scrutiny work that departmental Committees can undertake during the year. Committees can interest themselves in certain programmes and look at the related management, administrative and policy issues. In doing so, they can also examine the adequacy or accuracy of Estimates. The Executive have no problem with Committees taking such an interest. Committees should rightly interrogate spending plans at a departmental level, as well as in the wholesale context of Budget consideration at such times.</p>
<p>Ms Morrice raised many points that are well beyond the ambit of the Budget (No 2) Bill by nature of their detail. A Bill is coming forward concerning the children&rsquo;s commissioner, and it is not my place to imply or suggest that anything that the Assembly might legislate for is pre-empted or predetermined by the Budget (No 2) Bill &mdash; it is not.</p>
<p>Issues have been raised concerning the importance of statistics. I refer people with those concerns to my point that Committees should make sure that they impress their considerations on Departments to ensure better planning and targeting, which are necessary, because we need more robust statistics. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency is trying to do that on several levels, and it responds to and takes on board the working requests of other Departments. We are trying to improve that situation, and if Committees can offer any insight into statistical gaps we will try to make good those gaps. We identified that problem in relation to the North/South statistical profile, which we published earlier this year.</p>
<p>Ms Morrice asked what is being done to accommodate the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee&rsquo;s views on &lsquo;Strategy 2010&rsquo; and certain tax considerations. Mr McGrady asked about tax-raising powers and the sensitive issues involved in such considerations. The points made by Ms Morrice gave rise to questions about the fact that some people are seeking tax-raising and tax-reducing powers.</p>
<p>If we are to consider more fiscal discretion or leverage for the Assembly, we must make sure that we join up our thinking on that. It will be very difficult for us to make a coherent case for any improvement in such capacity if we are saying continually that we will not levy any increases and that what we want, by way of intervening powers for ourselves in the fiscal regime, is simply the ability to offset or duck certain taxes. We must make sure that we not only do more as a joined-up Government but that we are ready to show that we are a grown-up Government.</p>
<p>The points about following through on &lsquo;Strategy 2010&rsquo;, which raise questions about the impact of aspects of the fiscal regime, will be reflected by the Executive in their consideration with the Treasury and other devolved institutions of several matters in the fiscal regime &mdash; consideration that takes place at the Treasury&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>In the past we have reflected on fuel duties, aggregates tax and so on, and we will do so again &mdash; that will include tax breaks for creative industries. Those points will be made on behalf of the Executive, not just by me as Minister of Finance and Personnel, but by the Ministers with relevant sectoral interests, such as the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey, or, in the case of creative industries, the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Mr Michael McGimpsey. Those points will be pursued with the Treasury, not least by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, because it falls to them to represent and prosecute certain cases.</p>
<p>Mr Dallat made useful points about the implications of resource accounting and budgeting. We must understand that we are dealing with a different system. We do not fully realise the implications of that. It will create some difficulties, but I am impressed by the way in which Departments, including my own, have managed the challenge of change to date.</p>
<p>We must recognise that this will change the nature of the control that the Assembly will have. It gives us greater planning opportunities and greater planning challenges, because the Assembly will have more of the picture than it had before, as Mr Dallat said. Not only will the Assembly control spending, it will control the stock of assets. People have not fully realised the implications of that.</p>
<p>Mr Dallat&rsquo;s remarks on the contribution of the Public Accounts Committee are well made, but it should not just be up to the Public Accounts Committee to examine post hoc whether expenditure was undertaken in the most proper, beneficial and effective manner. There is a considerable gap of activity, and that will enable departmental Committees to become involved. They will be able usefully to interrogate more of the operative spending practices of Departments than previously. That will not in any way detract from the work of the Public Accounts Committee. In many ways it will build upon much of the work and consolidate many of the pointers and useful principles that have been established by the Public Accounts Committee in relation to some programmes. However, we cannot cover them all, and I would like to see the various Committees taking up and amplifying some of the concerns that have been registered.</p>
<p>There was one question on accruing resources. It is difficult to understand what appropriations in aid are. Cash received by Departments, with the approval of the Assembly, is appropriated towards their gross expenditure plans. Appropriations in aid are receipts and income that come to Departments and are used in support of our wider Budget, and that is what we mean by accruing resources.</p>
<p>I will refer points on individual spending programmes to the relevant Minister or write directly to Members on them. It would not be appropriate to go through all those points exhaustively because they are not necessarily appropriate to the Budget (No 2) Bill. I appreciate that some people missed the Supply motion last week because they had expected it to run into Tuesday, and I accept that some points have been saved from then and are being carried over now.</p>

<p class="small">That the Lands Tribunal (Salaries) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001 be approved.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the Order provides for increases in the annual salaries payable to the president and members of the Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland, with retrospective effect from 1 April 2000 and 1 April 2001, following recommendations made in the reports of the Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>
<p>While the provisions are straightforward, the procedures involved in their making have been anomalous. Before devolution such an Order was subject to negative resolution at Westminster and laid before Parliament under paragraph 3(3) of schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland Act 1974. Following devolution that Act was repealed, and such Orders became subject to affirmative resolution in the Assembly. Therefore the Department of Finance and Personnel has been required to draft the Order for the Secretary of State&rsquo;s signature. The draft Order does not include a commencement date, but that should be taken as the day after signature by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has agreed that I should take the Order forward on his behalf.</p>
<p>I commend the Order to the Assembly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90094" speakername="Mr Dermot Nesbitt" speakeroffice="The Junior Minister (Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister)" time="12:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#4">
<p>I beg to move</p>
<p class="small">That the Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001 be approved.</p>
<p>The Order arises because the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals Commission are being transferred from the Department of the Environment to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
<p>The Planning Appeals Commission deals with appeals against decisions of the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s Planning Service. Under the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 and the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973, the Department of the Environment has responsibilities relating to, for example, the remuneration allowance of the commissioners of the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals Commission.</p>
<p>The Water Appeals Commission comprises the four most senior members of the Planning Appeals Commission. It deals with appeals in regard to the work and responsibilities of the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department for Regional Development.</p>
<p>The Department of the Environment has been considering the appropriateness of its role in regard to those appellate bodies for some time. However, since the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 in Northern Ireland it has been examining its functions more closely to ensure its compliance with the 1998 Act and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Department was satisfied that the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals Commission are entirely independent and impartial. However, it recognised &mdash; as did we &mdash; that the current statutory arrangements could create a perception that the commissioners are not fully independent. For that reason, and with Mr Foster&rsquo;s agreement, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister proposes to acquire the sponsorship functions of the Department of the Environment.</p>
<p>The proposed transfer will provide these appellate bodies with more robust and transparent levels of independence and impartiality. The transfers would be effected under article 4(3) of the Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001. The functions under the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 that would be transferred from the Department of the Environment to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister would include powers to appoint commissioners to the Planning Appeals Commission and to determine their remuneration and allowances. The Office of the First Minster and the Deputy First Minister would also be granted powers to appoint staff to assist the commission in performing its functions, to determine their remuneration and allowances, and to determine remuneration allowances for any assessor appointed by the chief commissioner to assist at hearings. It would also acquire powers to make rules for regulating the procedure for proceedings before the commission and to prescribe fees in respect of commission applications.</p>
<p>It is proposed to transfer the functions contained in the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973 that provide for the appointment of the chief commissioner and other commissioners of the Water Appeals Commission, the payment of commissioners and those appointed to assist the commission. The four most senior members of the Planning Appeals Commission act jointly as commissioners of the Water Appeals Commission.</p>
<p>A consultation role in the appointment by the chief commissioner of an assessor to sit with the member of the commission at an appeal or hearing would also be transferred to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minster. There would also be provision to approve the payment by the commission of fees and allowances to an assessor and to make rules to regulate commission procedure.</p>
<p>Some of those functions currently fall to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Department for Regional Development and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, where these Departments have an interest in a water appeals hearing. Mrs Rodgers, Mr Campbell and Mr McGimpsey have agreed to the transfer of those functions to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, as outlined in articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Order.</p>
<p>The transfers of several other functions are set out in the Order. In February 1999, the Assembly approved an earlier report by the First Minister Designate and the Deputy First Minister Designate setting out details about certain functions of the 11 Departments in the Northern Ireland Administration.</p>
<p>The principal Departments (Transfer and Assignment of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1999, which implemented the agreed structures, was enacted in December 1999. Since its enactment, Departments have identified several statutory functions that must be transferred to other Departments to create consistency with the agreed allocation of functions at that time. The opportunity is now being taken to enact those transfers.</p>
<p>First, article 3 of the Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001 will transfer functions relating to the payment of expenses of the North/South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the Civic Forum from the Department of Finance and Personnel to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. While the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister supports the operation of the North/South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the Civic Forum, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that expenses in respect of these functions are defrayed as Department of Finance and Personnel expenses. That will be addressed and corrected by article 3. When the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was drafted, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister did not exist. The Order before the Assembly would regularise that position.</p>
<p>Secondly, the functions being transferred from the Department of the Environment to the Department of Finance and Personnel come under article 4(1) of the Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001. These transfers are necessary because of the distribution of functions under the principal 1999 Order. They relate to functions conferred on the Department of the Environment under social security legislation that deals with rate fraud in housing benefit claims.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the opportunity has been taken in article 4(2) to transfer several provisions from the Department of the Environment to the Department for Regional Development. Those provisions properly fall in the remit of the Department for Regional Development; they relate mainly to its responsibility for public transport and its obligations as a public roads authority for Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Fourthly, article 5 of the Order transfers functions from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to the Department of Finance and Personnel. This relates to the appointment of a committee to advise Departments on the exercise of functions under the Statistics of Trade and Employment (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. That committee is currently appointed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and the focus of its work is predominantly economic and business statistics. This degree of specialism is reflected in the membership of the committee. While current legislation makes provision for Departments other than the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to consult the committee on matters related to the collection and quality of general statistical information, this facility has not been widely used.</p>
<p>A committee appointed by the Department of Finance and Personnel will retain the statutory functions as currently detailed in the legislation relating to business statistics, and it will act in an independent advisory capacity to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency &mdash; an agency of the Department of Finance and Personnel. Given the agency&rsquo;s position as the host body for all Northern Ireland Civil Service statisticians and its role in quality-assuring their work, it is appropriate for the new committee to develop its role beyond pure statistics or business statistics. Therefore, its remit will span the statistical material of all Departments, as well as covering more fundamental issues such as quality assurance, a statistics code of practice and national statistics.</p>
<p>Fifthly, article 6 of the Order transfers certain functions under the Pension Schemes (Northern Ireland) Act 1993 from the Department for Social Development to the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment. This relates to the payment of contributions when an employer becomes insolvent. As those payments are infrequent, it has only recently come to light that in consequence of earlier legislation on the consolidation of pensions, the function is more appropriate to &mdash; and should have been transferred to &mdash; the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment.</p>
<p>My sixth point deals with article 7 of the Order, which carries some minor transfer from the Department of Education to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. This relates to library and recreational matters consistent with the transfer of library services, recreation and cultural activity functions from the Department of Education to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the principal 1999 Order.</p>
<p>Finally, article 11 of the Order makes legislative changes consequential upon the transfers. The Order has been scrutinised by the Committee of the Centre and the Examiner of Statutory Rules. All Ministers concerned in these transfers have been consulted and are content. I hope that Members will support these measures.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.4.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90048" speakername="Mr Oliver Gibson" speakeroffice="The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee of the Centre" time="13:00" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#4">
<p>The Committee of the Centre considered this Statutory Rule at Consultation Stage and Statutory Rule Stage. The junior Minister has outlined in detail the various transfers of functions from one Department to another. The Order was presented to us as a tidying-up exercise following the creation of the 11 new Departments and the establishment of devolution.</p>
<p>As outlined earlier by the junior Minister, the area of greatest concern to the Committee was the transfer of the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals Commission to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. We were told that this was to allow for greater independence. Currently the Department of the Environment has statutory responsibility for the Planning Appeals Commission, and the four most senior planning appeals commissioners comprise the Water Appeals Commission. Therefore, the appellate bodies were examining the decisions of the Department that had the statutory responsibility for them. While we were assured that they acted independently in that arrangement, this transfer creates a more open and accountable form of impartiality.</p>
<p>The Committee questioned whether these important appeal bodies would have been better set up outside the central Government structure to provide them with even more independence and impartiality. However, the Government had already announced a review of public administration, and the Committee decided that this matter should be taken on board in that review. All forms of appeals in our administrative system should be seen not only as apparently independent, but as very obviously independent.</p>
<p>The junior Minister dealt with the 11 transfer functions which relate to Departments other than the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The Committee of the Centre consulted with the other relevant Assembly Committees and got assurances on the points of concern that were raised. The junior Ministers attended the Committee of the Centre and positively answered the questions that had caused concern. Therefore, the Committee of the Centre is fairly and reasonably satisfied that it can recommend that this Statutory Rule be accepted and affirmed.</p>

<p>I welcome Mr Gibson&rsquo;s comment that he is fairly and reasonably satisfied. If anyone says to anyone else here that he is fairly and reasonably satisfied, that can be taken as a commendation. Mr Gibson rightly said, as did I at the outset, that the main thrust of this transfer of functions is to deal with the Planning Appeals Commission and the Water Appeals Commission. There are others coming through as well.</p>
<p>While satisfied that both commissions are entirely independent and impartial, this provides a greater outward display of that impartiality. It remains for me to thank Mr Gibson on behalf of the Committee that he represents for his words of support. I ask that the motion to approve these provisions be supported.</p>

<p>During Question Time last week a Minister was asked questions about matters that were not his responsibility. They were occasioned less by their appropriateness as questions to that Minister than by the events of the recent elections. As the Deputy Speaker ruled at that time, such questions are out of order. They should not be put, and, if put, the Minister should not be required to respond.</p>
<p>The Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, the hon Peter Milliken, and several of his parliamentary Colleagues have visited us today, and some Members have had an opportunity to meet them. It is an honour for the Assembly not only to receive distinguished parliamentarians, but, for the first time since it decided to join the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA), to be visited by parliamentarians from a CPA legislature. On the Assembly&rsquo;s behalf, I extend a hearty welcome to Speaker Milliken and his Colleagues.</p>
<p>The Minister is in his place, unlike some Members who have tabled questions. I will call Members, but if they are not in the Chamber they may not put their questions and, unfortunately, Members will not be able to ask supplementary questions. Mr John Kelly, Mr McHugh, Mrs Iris Robinson and Mr Conor Murphy are not in their places. However, Mr Gibson is present.</p>

<p>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will answer questions 5 and 9 together.</p>

<p>Will the Minister assure the Assembly that, irrespective of any structures for post-primary education proposed in the Burns Report, the primary importance of any review is to ensure an increasing standard in educational provision? What criteria have been given to the Burns team to ensure increasing academic success for every pupil in this age range?</p>

<p>The purpose of the Burns review body is to put in place a strengthened and enhanced education system. The review body&rsquo;s terms of reference were to consider research and other relevant information on the impact of selection on pupils, parents, teachers, the economy and society, and to undertake widespread consultation. The purpose of the consultation was to identify and consider key issues arising from the current selective system of post-primary education, and to assess the extent to which the current arrangements for post- primary education meet the needs and aspirations of children and their parents and the requirements of the economy and society.</p>
<p>The terms of reference also state that the review body should report its conclusions and recommendations on the future arrangements for post-primary education to the Minister of Education, and address specifically: the most appropriate structures for post-primary education, including the age or ages at which transfer should occur; the administrative arrangements for transfer; the implications for the curriculum at primary and post-primary levels; the implications for current school structures; the implications for further and higher education and training; the anticipated impact of any proposed new arrangements on the economy; the cost of any revised arrangements; and the timing and phasing of any new proposed arrangements.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Given that research carried out after 1998 in Britain &mdash; Members will note that I say &quot;Britain&quot;, not &quot;Great Britain&quot; &mdash; at the University of York shows that some comprehensive schools do better than grammar schools and secondary moderns in progressing children from Key Stage 3 to Key Stage 4, and that research carried out in Cardiff shows similar success, will the Minister tell the House how extensive the review body&rsquo;s consultation has been?</p>

<p>This consultation has been the biggest by far on any education issue in recent years. The review body has held over 25 public meetings, two open days to receive oral evidence and meetings with representatives of business and commerce, and it has received over 1,000 written submissions. There has been huge public interest in the work of the review body, and there have been approximately 250,000 hits on the official web site. Barry McElduff is a member of the Education Committee, and it is important that that Committee submit its views as a matter of urgency so that they can also be considered.</p>

<p>Has the Minister noted the recent comments made by the former chief press secretary to the Prime Minister, Alastair Campbell, who said that the days of the bog-standard comprehensive school were over? Does the Minister agree that there is little point in copying an experiment in England that experts agreed failed between 1971 and 1999?</p>

<p>I noted those comments when they were made. The Department of Education has put in place a wide-ranging review. The Gallagher and Smith Report provided information on education in England, Scotland and some European countries. The review body and the panel of education advisors have substantial knowledge of these matters. The review body has undertaken study visits to the South, Scotland, the Netherlands and Austria to experience their systems at first hand.</p>
<p>It would be a serious mistake to pre-empt the outcome of the review body&rsquo;s deliberations. An extensive consultation is taking place, and, as a result of the information that I have received from the review body and its trips abroad, I am certain that it is taking a broad view of all this.</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that when considering comprehensive education he would do well to examine the concept of community schools that exists in the Republic of Ireland? Not only are they comprehensive, but they are open to the whole community, thereby promoting lifelong learning.</p>

<p>The review body undoubtedly had extensive discussions with education authorities in Dublin during its recent visit there and became fully appraised of the community schools.</p>
<p>Members are trying to glean some indication as to how all this will turn out, but I do not know how it will turn out, because the review body is independent. It has been involved in in-depth discussions on many education systems, and I am as keenly interested as Mr Dallat in the outcome of its deliberations.</p>

<p>I do not regard the Minister&rsquo;s answer as satisfactory. Does he agree that the official responses given by the schools affected by these proposals are the most significant responses he will receive? They should be given greater consideration than responses from individuals, which can always be input in large numbers in order to distort the apparent balance of opinion on the matters being discussed. Therefore, can he assure us that he will be giving full and proper weight to the responses received from the schools affected by the proposals?</p>

<p>I am particularly interested to hear what representational bodies have to say about the proposals. However, this is a consultation; it is not a referendum. Decisions will have to be made taking into account the various views expressed, the policy context and, most importantly, what is judged as being best for schools. I understand the Member&rsquo;s point, but we need to remember that this is a consultation exercise. There is a particular interest in hearing what the representational bodies have to say.</p>

<p>There is some concern about that. In considering the extension of the deadline until later in the year, we were very conscious of the ongoing intention in the Department to put this in place as early as possible at the beginning of next year. Any delay would be highly detrimental, as we are dealing with the sense of unfairness and inequities perceived by many people in the education system.</p>
<p>I regard this as an urgent priority &mdash; an objective to be achieved as quickly as possible. This has put people under pressure. It has put many officials in my Department under pressure, and by extending the period of consultation I have made their lives much more difficult. We are determined to complete this process by early next year.</p>

<p>With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will take questions 10 and 1 together.</p>
<p>In publishing its recent report, the Human Rights Commission acknowledged that the report is the work of Laura Lundy, senior law lecturer at Queen&rsquo;s University. No specific human rights issues have been identified. Under my Department&rsquo;s New TSN action plan, a working group was established some time ago to consider the promotion of access to schools by disadvantaged groups, with particular reference to the operation of admissions criteria.</p>
<p>Laura Lundy is a member of that group. Its report will issue from the Department to schools in late August as specific advice for the review of admissions criteria. My Department will also be undertaking an equality impact assessment of the open enrolment policy in 2002-03 under its statutory equality scheme. The whole system of post- primary provision is currently under review.</p>
<p>My Department is aware of these important issues and is taking appropriate action. I should also stress that admissions criteria are statutorily matters for boards of governors, and their legality is a matter for the courts.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his response, although I am surprised that he said that there were no specific human rights issues identified in the commission&rsquo;s report. Given that this matter is urgent and accepting that it is for boards of governors to implement, can the Minister say how quickly he expects to issue any revised guidance in the light of that report? Will he be taking any further action so that the admission of pupils who are neither Catholic nor Protestant to integrated schools is treated more fairly than at present?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.5.32" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90081" speakername="Mr Martin McGuinness" time="14:45" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#5">
<p>As I said earlier, we intend to issue advice to the boards of governors in late August, and that will help to settle these matters. We should not exaggerate the extent of the problems we face. Generally, boards of governors take great care in drawing up and applying their criteria, and they exercise their responsibilities very conscientiously. We must ensure that any problems identified are resolved in the future, and that includes the problem with integrated schools. We are monitoring the situation carefully, but we must keep the problems in perspective and in context.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat a Cheann Comhairle. I apologise to you, Mr Speaker, to the Minister and to the Assembly for not being present when my question was called.</p>
<p>Do I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s answer that he is concerned about the problems in the system?</p>

<p>I would be concerned if there were a perception that our approach or that of schools and boards of governors left something to be desired. These are important issues, and doubtless many Members receive communications from their constituents, particularly in the aftermath of the results of the 11-plus examinations. We have tried to deal with the problem by establishing the working party. That was a positive development, and we await the outcome of it. The advice will issue to schools in August, and I hope that we can overcome many of the difficulties as a result.</p>

<p>Every school is required to have a written discipline policy that must promote self- discipline, good behaviour and respect for others among pupils. Bullying behaviour is unacceptable and should be addressed by schools as part of their existing discipline policies. On a voluntary basis, many schools have developed a separate anti-bullying policy. I intend to strengthen that position by taking the next legislative opportunity to make it mandatory for every school to have an anti-bullying policy in place and to implement it.</p>

<p>As the establishment of new schools involves substantial public expenditure, their eligibility for grant-aid must be assessed against a range of criteria to ensure that they are robust and educationally effective.

<p>When I first came to the Department of Education, I stressed the importance of parental choice and of ensuring that we allow for the demand for education in relation to particular sections of the community, whether in the integrated, Irish-medium or any other sector. We said that we would do everything in our power, as long as people came forward with robust proposals. On the specific issue of applications for the establishment of new schools, we have been at pains to ensure that there has been no favouritism for anybody and that people&rsquo;s rights have been protected. At all times the Department has ensured that it adhered rigidly to its criteria for the establishment of new schools or the continuation of schools that were under threat.</p>

<p>As there are no further questions, we must leave questions to the Minister of Education at this point.</p>
<p>I am aware that Members&rsquo; minds may, for various reasons, be on matters outside the Chamber, but it is a matter of more than mere regret that many Members whose names were down to ask questions were not in the Chamber when their time came. In addition, any Members who may have wished to ask supplementary questions were denied the opportunity to do so. Although that may be a discourtesy and a disadvantage to the House, it is also a discourtesy to the Minister and his civil servants, who have taken substantial time to prepare responses to the questions. Frankly, that is not the way in which the House should be treating those who are servants of the House and of the Executive.</p>
<p>At this point, according to the agreement previously reached through the usual channels, the House will, by leave, suspend and resume at 3.00 pm with questions to the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>

<p>A Cheann Comhairle. Tá mé sásta gur labhair Gníomhaireacht an Chaomhnóra ad Litem ó seoladh í i mí na Samhna 1996 go héifeachtach ar son páistí sa dlí poiblí agus in imeachtaí uchtaithe agus gur chuir sí seirbhís mheasúil ar fáil do na cuairteanna.</p>

<p>To clarify, I should explain that I have carried out the duties of guardian ad litem as an employee of a health and social services board, though it is not an interest to declare. It seems that with the setting up of the agency, there is now less consistency in the work of individual guardians, and they may take different attitudes in accordance with their professional judgement. I would not wish guardians to be in the same position as, perhaps, psychiatrists or doctors, by finding that they disagree with each other in court. To ensure consistency, is there not a case for considering greater regulation of the way the entire panel works?</p>

<p>Each case is unique and must be treated on its merits. It is ultimately for the court to determine the action to be taken, based on the evidence before it and its assessment of the Guardian Ad Litem Agency&rsquo;s recommendations. The Social Services Inspectorate is empowered to carry out inspections of the agency to ensure that its services adhere to acceptable standards and that it continues to satisfy legislative and departmental requirements. The Social Services Inspectorate will shortly plan its business programme for the next five years. Together with the Department&rsquo;s childcare unit, it will consider whether there is a need to include an inspection of the Guardian Ad Litem Agency during the planning cycle. I am informed that the courts value highly the work of the Guardian Ad Litem Agency; it is my assessment that they are satisfied with the agency&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>I support the view that these new drugs are an important development for several patients with severe and progressive rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to existing drug therapies. I appreciate that for service users with chronic arthritis, the potential benefit that these new drugs offer appears to be considerable. However, as further studies are required to ascertain the efficacy of these treatments in the longer term, it is essential that their use is strictly controlled and monitored &mdash; particularly in the light of possible serious and adverse side effects.</p>
<p>Boards have agreed to adopt a cautious approach to the introduction of these drugs by taking account of the increasing evidence of their effectiveness and of the resources available. I am awaiting further expert advice on the effectiveness of the drugs. However, in the event of any decision to move beyond their gradual introduction, I will not hesitate to seek the support of the Executive in securing the necessary resources.</p>

<p>Given that these drugs are widely used and widely recommended by the medical profession, will the Minister assure me that she will meet the patients, their families, their doctors and their nurses?

<p>The Member referred to the widespread use of these drugs. Usage here is in keeping with usage in the wider NHS; in fact, it compares favourably with it. The Department continuously assesses the published evidence about these new drugs. It recently received evidence that was submitted jointly by rheumatologists and Arthritis Care. It is likely that that information will form part of the evidence that will be presented to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). In addition, my Department will soon meet with rheumatologists and boards. As I said, the drugs are the subject of an appraisal by NICE, which is expected to produce guidance on their use later this year.</p>

<p>The Hayes Report has outraged most of the residents of County Tyrone. Most of the area covered by Cookstown, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane district councils has been marginalised. Accessibility and availability of services are not properly provided for in the Hayes Report because of the decline of Tyrone County Hospital.

<p>The report is a frank assessment of the problems that face our hospital services, and it underlines the need for the problems to be confronted. Everyone who is affected by the report should take time to study it carefully, and everyone will have an opportunity to make his or her views known. It is important to stress that no decisions have been or will be taken prior to a period of consultation. Any changes that are proposed for the long-term future of our acute hospitals will be subject to an equality impact assessment. I agree that the question of access to acute hospital services is a matter of crucial interest, and I reiterate that everyone will have an opportunity to make their views known.</p>

<p>The Hayes Report on acute services has caused immense disquiet and anger in Omagh and west Tyrone. The recommendation flies in the face of all logical factors involved in medical care provision. What comfort and consideration can the Minister offer the staff and, in particular, the patients of the Tyrone County Hospital who have genuine fears about the future of acute services provision in west Tyrone?</p>
<p>Finally, can the Minister assure my constituents in Omagh that nothing underhand has taken place to their detriment, and will she give a sincere pledge that her Department will listen to Omagh&rsquo;s case on this matter during the consultation stage in the next few months?</p>

<p>I commissioned an independent review to give me advice on all the complex issues involved and to make recommendations about the way forward. I have now received that report, and I wish to give it careful consideration with my Colleagues in the Executive.</p>

That will take time.</p>
<p>The Programme for Government envisages an agreed way forward by the end of this year. However, when that was laid out, we expected the report to be available at an earlier stage.

<p>In the light of the Hayes Report that has just been published, does the Minister agree that the proposals of the working party regarding the provision of services in Downe Hospital &mdash; the Stewart Report &mdash; should have been implemented? The Minister placed a moratorium on the building of the new hospital in Downpatrick approximately a year and a half ago. She suspended the architectural work and placed a moratorium on the procurement of equipment for the new hospital. Does she not agree that she should now lift those moratoria? The new hospital buildings will cater for whatever services will go into them. Two years have already been lost, and it is absolutely disgraceful that medical, surgical and nursing staff are expected to work in the archaic conditions that now exist in the Downe Hospital.</p>

<p>I have already met members from the chamber of commerce during the period of suspension. I have not received a specific request to repeat that particular presentation. However, we do have a lengthy list of councils and others who have asked to meet me to discuss the matter.

<p>I am happy to confirm the thrust of that. As the Executive emphasised in the Programme for Government, resources available from taxpayers are finite and stretched by the need to provide services to meet levels of need that are greater than the UK average. The Executive have also had to deal with a legacy of historical underfunding in the infrastructure of our public services, which means that education, for example, has a backlog of capital investment needs of around £500 million. That simply cannot be funded in the traditional manner with the resources available.</p>
<p>It is therefore important that the Executive and the Departments explore new ways of financing public services such as PFI/PPP. Where this is employed, it is invariably because the traditional investment approach has been considered but has been judged to be unaffordable from available resources. PFI/PPP is used to address real needs, but only if deals with private- sector partners are affordable and demonstrably deliver value for money.</p>

<p>Will the Minister assure us that it will be part of the remit of the new working group to consult with other Departments and particularly to look at other innovative schemes for funding the investment deficit such as bond schemes, which are being examined by at least one Department?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.5.96" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90040" speakername="Mr Mark Durkan" time="15:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#5">
<p>It is intended that the group will work with all relevant Departments and for all Departments. It will be trying to ensure that we can make better use of other financing opportunities to provide public services and maximise the amount of investment that takes place in the public interest. We must keep underscoring that we are trying to maximise the amount of investment in the public interest, and we are talking about the provision of better public services for the longer term. That will involve working with all Departments. Some of the ideas are not going to be as straightforward as some of their sponsors necessarily believe, so the working group will have to address some of the issues that arise, for example, in the context of Treasury rules.</p>

<p>I can confirm that. Public procurement is first and foremost the means by which the public sector buys in the goods and services that it needs to discharge its responsibilities to the citizens. Securing commercial value for money is an important consideration. With well over £1&nbsp;billion a year being spent, not only might savings be possible but that activity has the potential to have a significant impact on the social and economic environment. For that reason, the review team has, as part of its terms of reference, the task of exploring the scope to use public procurement to further social, economic and environmental objectives in the context of current EC and international law relating to procurement. I look forward to its findings and recommendations.</p>

<p>Compensation is not payable for consequential losses connected with foot-and-mouth disease controls. However, Members will be aware that the Executive have approved the Help for Business scheme. The costs for the Help for Business scheme cannot yet be quantified, as applications are still being received.

Those figures are the subject of discussions between Treasury and Department of Finance and Personnel officials.</p>

<p>Will the Minister bear in mind that many businesses in west Tyrone have been adversely affected by foot-and-mouth disease? Many of those directly affected were tourist facilities, and others were suppliers connected with the tourist industry. What immediate relief can the Minister offer them by way of financial aid?</p>

<p>I again refer the Member to the Help for Business scheme that has been announced. That scheme is taking applications from businesses that can demonstrate that they have been directly affected and are suffering financial hardship as a direct result of the foot-and-mouth disease crisis. Businesses that fall into that category in west Tyrone should be availing of that scheme. The tests that have been introduced &mdash; including being able to show a 15% drop in turnover &mdash; are neither complicated nor exacting. I hope that as many Members as possible will encourage any business raising concerns with them to apply for that scheme.</p>

<p>The senior civil service review commenced at the beginning of March this year, and the review team is due to report its findings to me in September.

<p>The point of embarking on such a significant review was to ensure that the review team&rsquo;s ideas would influence future appointments and promotions.

<p>The Executive are committed to giving Committees a constructive role in the development of the Budget for 2002-03. The proposed Budget timetable provides for initial input from Committees &mdash; that process will start before the summer &mdash; before the Executive consider the draft Budget in September.</p>
<p>The early involvement of Committees, which was not possible last year, will be informed by the Executive&rsquo;s position report &lsquo;Developing the Programme for Government and the Budget for 2002-03&rsquo;, which was published this month. Compared to last year, Committees will have two extra weeks in the autumn to scrutinise the draft Budget. Thus, the Assembly will have a meaningful input throughout the Budget process.</p>

<p>We are conscious that we must have consultation on the draft Budget with all the groups listed in the Department of Finance and Personnel equality scheme. There must be similar consultation on the Programme for Government with all the groups listed in the scheme administered by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. In that context, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister has already issued copies of the position report to over 1,200 groups and individuals listed in the equality schemes and invited them to comment. The same material that was made available to Committees has been distributed to a wide range of groups. It is also available on the Internet.</p>
<p>We are trying to ensure that the broadest possible range of social and economic partners can discuss the issues that the Executive lay before the Assembly and that their views are conveyed to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, in respect of the Programme for Government, and to the Department of Finance and Personnel, in respect of the Budget. Committees will also benefit from those insights.</p>

<p>I will take questions 6 and 7 together. The review of the Rate Collection Agency is coming towards the end of its first stage. The first stage of the quinquennial review examines the organisational options. If agency status is confirmed, the review will proceed to the second stage, which is a forward-looking consideration of improvements in performance. I currently have no plans to change the status of the Rate Collection Agency.</p>

<p>There is some good news built in there. In early May, the team that was asked to consider the purchase of two new computer systems for the Rate Collection Agency was suspended. What was the reason for the suspension?</p>

<p>As part of the Rate Collection Agency&rsquo;s plan for the future, an outline business case for a project to deliver a new integrated computer service was developed and submitted to the Department on 27 April. However, the agency decided to suspend further work on the project until after the quinquennial review, to ensure that any future investment would be maximised.</p>
<p>Pending the outcome of the quinquennial review, the agency is concentrating on securing appropriate business continuity arrangements to minimise the risks arising from the continued operation of its two existing computer systems.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his response and specifically for his assurance that he has no plans to change the status of the agency. Can he confirm to the Assembly that the Rate Collection Agency is significantly more efficient than the vast majority of authorities in GB in its collection of rates &mdash; or in GB&rsquo;s case, council tax &mdash; and that any possible change in status would have to be based on a need to improve what is already an excellent service?</p>

<p>I am happy to confirm the performance efficiency of the Rate Collection Agency. I have made that point before in answer to questions from Mr Ford&rsquo;s Colleague, who seemed to be less impressed by the indications of the Rate Collection Agency&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>Stage one of the quinquennial is not yet complete. If agency status is confirmed, we will move into stage two. I have not yet received any report or recommendations arising out of stage one.</p>

<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. To follow on from the same question, can the Minister confirm that there is speculation that the Rate Collection Agency is going out to tender and that BT and NIE are bidding for the contract? There is also speculation that the review team favours the Rate Collection Agency&rsquo;s function being contracted out to the private sector.</p>

<p>No proposals or recommendations have yet come to me. The Rate Collection Agency&rsquo;s chief executive has written to all the staff to inform them of what favoured option was emerging in stage one. That letter was copied to me as Minister and I, in turn, copied it to the Finance and Personnel Committee. It is in the context of that information that the other rumours that Mr Molloy has referred to have been circulating.</p>

<p>Does the Minister take the view that levelling rates is a primitive and crude method of raising revenue and that, as in certain states in the United States of America, local purchase taxes and income taxes, which reflect more accurately an individual&rsquo;s ability to pay, are a fairer way of raising revenue? Will he undertake to consider that?</p>

<p>In the context of the rating policy review, we are trying to make sure that we have a means of raising revenue that is efficient in giving a good yield but fair in the burdens it imposes on households and businesses. The Member referred to direct taxes, including some examples of states in the USA, but direct taxes of various kinds can be as unpopular and at times as crude and simplistic as he thinks that rating policy is.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to make a statement.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 6 May, four weeks before the general election and six weeks before the meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council, the First Minister announced his intention to resign from office on 1 July if decommissioning did not take place. Owing to the results of the general election and the local council elections and the success of anti- agreement candidates, it is clear that the First Minister has no option but to resign.</p>
<p>To make that gesture meaningful, all Unionist Ministers ought to resign with him. To do otherwise would be to reduce the actions of the First Minister to a stunt &mdash; <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

<p>Order. Members on all sides &mdash; at least those with any experience &mdash; ought to be aware that personal statements are heard in silence. I ask that this convention be observed. It has not always been observed in the Chamber, but Members should adhere to it.</p>
</speech>

<p>To do otherwise would be to reduce the actions of the First Minister to a stunt, the result of which would be to see further concessions made to Republicans over the summer on policing, amnesties for on-the-run terrorists and demilitarisation. All Members must be acutely aware that that will be the inevitable consequence if the First Minister alone resigns.</p>
<p>My Colleague Maurice Morrow and I have therefore today tendered to the Speaker a letter of resignation effective on the resignation of all the First Minister&rsquo;s party Colleagues from the Executive.</p>

<p>That action, together with the election results, will send out the clearest possible signal that the current system does not command the support of a majority of Unionists in Northern Ireland. The DUP is committed to finding an accommodation that can command such support and in pursuing that aim it will talk to any democratic party. However, it will not sit down or negotiate with those who are not committed to exclusively peaceful means. The DUP will not act in a way that will simply hand over Departments to those who support the Belfast Agreement; it will act in the best interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Today we challenge the First Minister to see if he is serious about decommissioning and give him the opportunity to take a decisive and meaningful step. The process has reached a moment of truth, and the First Minister can halt the concessions to Republicans that may be made over the summer months. I challenge him to act now. Let him heed the will of the Unionist electorate and prevent a further wave of capitulation and concessions.</p>
<p>It is time to unify Unionism behind a position that can command the support of the majority of Unionists. This is an opportunity that Unionism can ill afford to miss. Mr Morrow and I remain ready to divulge the precise terms of our letter as and when the First Minister does likewise. <i>[Interruption].</i></p>

<p>As I advised the House on 8 May, the occasion of a previous personal statement, this statement will be made under the precedent of a statement made on 15 July 1999. When Ministers make statements about their personal position that affect public office, an opportunity may be given to other party leaders or their nominees to make comment or response to them.</p>

<p>I am astonished by some of the comments that have been made by Mr Campbell. He appears to be in some doubt as to what the letter I lodged with the Speaker says. If there is any problem I will publish the letter. It contains one sentence. It is absolutely clear in what it contains and what its effects will be.</p>
<p>Behind the fog of language that we heard from Mr Campbell two things stand out. First, he is incompetent; he has not read the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The letter he has lodged will have no effect. A letter of resignation &mdash; if he can read the Northern Ireland Act &mdash; should be sent to the Deputy First Minister and myself. Sending a resignation letter to the Speaker has no effect at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, he is a coward, he is a political coward. If he had any courage he would go now. What is he going to do? He says &mdash;<i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

<p>He says that after I resign he might think about it. In other words he is content to follow me, and by saying that, he is showing that he and his party regard me as the leader of Unionism.</p>

<p>Mr Campbell described the First Minister&rsquo;s resignation letter and any implementation of it as a &quot;stunt&quot;. Mr Campbell and Mr Morrow seem to be offering what might at best be described as a &quot;shadow stunt&quot;. They &quot;may&quot; resign if other Ministers resign following Mr Trimble&rsquo;s resignation. It seems to me that they are suggesting that all the Unionist Ministers should take the same step and the same moves in a manner that I think is dangerously close to a political form of line dancing. I would have thought that on that basis the DUP Ministers might reconsider what they are offering.</p>
<p>For some time it has been clear to many of us outside Unionism that there are two groups of people on David Trimble&rsquo;s back: those within his party are there because they are trying to bring him down; and those from the DUP are there because they are quite happy to piggyback on David Trimble and on the success and the workings of the agreement.</p>
<p>Yet again, we have an indication from the DUP of their attempt to talk up their stance, and how they are out to break or undermine the agreement, while at the same time taking care to shelter themselves within the office of the agreement.</p>
<p>The non-statement from Mr Campbell and the very obvious non-statement by Mr Morrow, or &quot;Mr Ditto&quot;, show that the DUP, in spite of its hype about its mandate, has no agenda now that the election is over.</p>

<p>I was always convinced that what my two Colleagues were going to do was right, but having seen the tantrum thrown by the First Minister, to hear his ranting and raving, and to see his attitude &mdash; <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
<p>That gentleman was not even elected. He is best described as what the scriptures call &quot;a creeper&quot;.</p>
<p>Let me make it clear that Mr Durkan, who seems also to be enraged, remembers a day in the House when they were kissing him, congratulating him and patting him on the shoulder because he had been elected to office in the Assembly. Who was it who brought him down? It was not the gentlemen sitting on those Benches, who were hiding away in Glengall Street. It was I and this party behind me who brought the mighty man down. If anyone suggests that my party is interested in office rather than principle, that proves that it is not. If we had been interested in office we could have taken the best offices in the House. That is a fact of history that cannot be gainsaid.</p>
<p>What has happened today is this: the bluff of the First Minister and his fellow travellers who are trying to fool the public that they can stay in power when he goes has been called. We know that when he goes, they have to go. Why do they not do it decently and let every Unionist worth his name and who has any interest in defeating Republicanism and the IRA resign? <i>[Interruption].</i></p>
<p>We are not prepared to put Republicans into office, as the party that is mumbling would be very glad to do. The moment of decision and of truth has come, and if these men were Unionists they would get out and stay out.</p>

<p>We do have to reflect on the message now coming from broad Unionism that after years of preaching about politics and democracy, it has surrendered. We used to hear the &quot;No surrender&quot; catchphrase of Unionism; now we hear surrender. The message from broad Nationalism and Republicanism is that yes, there are problems, but we can resolve them through dialogue, negotiation and commitment to politics. I direct that to all those on the opposite Benches. <i>[Interruption].</i></p>

<p>Order. There is a Member on the Back Benches who does not seem to have acquainted himself with the proceedings of the House. It would be better if he sat and observed. If he cannot abide by the rulings of the Speaker it would be better that he did not stay here for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>My point &mdash; and it is an important one &mdash; is that if we measure the progress of the last few years against our collective experience of political failure, there is only one option. That option is to continue on this path, take our courage in our hands and exercise the mandate we received to deliver peace and democracy through negotiation, agreement and mutual respect. We will then solve the outstanding problems of militarisation and policing in our society, the criminal justice review and, yes, the question of arms. We will resolve those problems by agreement and by applying ourselves in a diligent, sensible fashion. Those who set ultimatums and unrealistically expect that we can solve the problems of generations in a matter of months betray the expectations of those who voted for the Good Friday Agreement and those who voted for the setting up of these political institutions.</p>
<p>Let us abandon this silliness, this theatre of tit-for-tat: &quot;If you resign, I&rsquo;ll resign; if you surrender, I&rsquo;ll surrender; if you jump, I&rsquo;ll jump.&quot;</p>
<p>Let us commit ourselves to exercising the mandate given to us by an overwhelming majority of those who live in the Six Counties and endorsed by an overwhelming majority of those who live on this island and in the international community. Let us make politics work and stay at it until we do.</p>

<p>I do not know what all the fuss is about. Gregory Campbell will continue to be Minister for Regional Development, Maurice Morrow will continue to be Minister for Social Development, and Dr Paisley will continue to be the Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development. Once again the DUP is trying to bluff the people into believing that they are not going to make the Assembly work, when even the dogs in the street know that they are working the system.</p>
<p>People on the street know that devolution works, and they know that the Assembly works. The Assembly will continue to work despite today&rsquo;s protest by the DUP.</p>

<p>Is it not sad that those who signed up to the agreement have brought the whole democratic process in Northern Ireland into disrepute with what is taking place in the Chamber today? We are being treated to nothing more sophisticated than a political game of chicken played by the Ulster Unionist Party and the DUP. They have no mandate to remain in the House for one more minute, because they presented themselves to the electorate on the basis of &quot;no guns, no Government&quot; and total opposition to the Belfast Agreement and its institutions. They stated clearly that they would not have terrorists in Government. The only fact is Mr McGuinness&rsquo;s statement &mdash; at the beginning of the negotiations in Castle Buildings that brought this whole sordid process into being &mdash; that there would be no guns before, during or after the negotiations.</p>
<p>Mr Trimble may issue post-dated resignations, and the DUP may mimic that move, but the only people who have stuck to their guns are those represented by Sinn Féin on the other side of the Chamber. Fifty-nine percent of the electorate cast their votes on the basis of Mr Trimble&rsquo;s promise that he would resign, and on the DUP&rsquo;s promise to smash the agreement. The electorate voted against terrorists in Government. However, they are sitting in the Chamber and will continue to sit in the Executive for as long as they wish to do so.</p>

<p>I am grateful that I am able to bring this important motion to the Assembly for debate in order to highlight the problem of alcohol consumption in public places, alcohol abuse by young people under the age of 18, and the problems of overindulgence. Many of my constituents in the small towns and villages of Fermanagh and South Tyrone &mdash; especially in Moy, County Tyrone &mdash; have seen these problems at first hand. They have endured weekend after weekend of alcohol- related disturbances with severe loss to their quality of life.</p>
<p>I do not condemn people for enjoying alcohol when they are responsible and aware of other people&rsquo;s rights. Each weekend, many people enjoy a drink responsibly and without impinging on the rights of others, either on their person or their property. Most are sensible enough to go home by taxi or with someone who has not imbibed alcohol. I commend groups that socialise together and organise rotas with a designated non-drinking driver.</p>
<p class="italic">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the Chair)</p>
<p>In a tolerant society people should be aware that there are consequences for breaking the law. Laws are not made to restrict but to protect. I am concerned about young people who drink to excess, drink in public places, create a nuisance, drop litter or damage and destroy property.</p>
<p>I am also concerned about the high incidence of under-age drinking, which ensures a continuing culture of irresponsible use of alcohol. In 1999, the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs (ESPAD) involving 15- to 18-year-old students showed that the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland shared the dubious distinction of being in the top four European nations of students who had been drunk 10 times or more during the 12 months preceding the survey, and of students who reported binge drinking three times or more during the 30 days previous to the survey. Binge drinking is defined as having five or more drinks at a time.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the wine-drinking countries such as France, Italy and others in the Mediterranean area report the lowest incidences of such behaviour. It is important that parents encourage their children to have a responsible attitude towards the use of alcohol. Lessons in high schools and grammar schools on the effects of alcohol could help to combat the growing under-age drinking culture.</p>
<p>A recent UK-wide study by Dr Martin Plant of the Edinburgh-based Alcohol and Health Research Centre found that 75% of children aged between 15 and 16 admitted that they had been drunk. The study also shows that one in four deaths of young men are alcohol-related. The charity Alcohol Concern, in response to the study, called for tighter enforcement of under-age drinking laws, by saying:</p>
<p class="small">&quot;We just want to see the existing laws enforced properly when they have been broken by people selling alcohol to under-age drinkers.&quot;</p>
<p>At the World Health Organisation conference in Stockholm in February this year, EU Commissioner David Byrne said:</p>
<p class="small">&quot;My key message on delivering change on alcohol and youth is the three Es: enforcement, enforcement and more enforcement.&quot;</p>
<p>Law enforcement could be combined with a considered approach by the Government to address how the drinks industry aggressively markets alcoholic products.</p>
<p>The drinks industry is very experienced at focusing on particular target groups, and the introduction of alcopops shows that there can be only one conclusion as to what group the industry was targeting and appealing to. One drinks company even undertook market research on women&rsquo;s attitudes to discover how to make bottled beer more attractive to females. The end result was an easier-to-hold bottle and a thicker label for women to peel off. Needless to say, sales improved.</p>
<p>What can be done? Is more legislation necessary? Yes. An immediate start can be made with the enforcement of existing laws and by-laws. Even if the Assembly produced new legislation, any law is useless unless it is enforced. The abysmal failure of existing by-laws to control public and under-age drinking stems from the inability of either district councils or the RUC to enforce them.</p>
<p>District councils have powers to create by-laws under the Local Government Act 1972. Each of the 26 councils in Northern Ireland is responsible for its alcohol by-laws.</p>
<p>There are 26 council areas and 26 different ways to apply alcohol by-laws. This inconsistency was highlighted by a review of the operation of alcohol by-laws in Northern Ireland that was presented to my local council &mdash; Dungannon and South Tyrone &mdash; by its director last year. As part of that study, responses were received from 21 councils. The findings showed that the enforcement of alcohol by-laws in Northern Ireland is at best patchy and at worst non-existent. It is a lengthy and costly process for a local council, under an existing by-law, to designate a street, a village or a town as an alcohol-free zone. Legislation is required to make it simpler for new areas to be added to a schedule attached to the existing by-laws. However, serious consideration should be given to the introduction of Northern Ireland-wide legislation to create a consistent approach to tackling alcohol abuse in public areas.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need to clarify the relationship between the local authorities and the police. Responsibility for the by-laws and prosecution lies with the councils. Detection of the offence is the responsibility of the police. That division creates a weakness in tackling a serious issue. Local authorities are concerned that the police do not pursue rigorous detection of offences. Conversely, there are reduced detection rates by the police due to the lack of commitment by some councils to proceed with prosecutions.</p>
<p>The problem of the enforcement of alcohol by-laws is exacerbated when many inebriated persons are gathered together. There is also a high cost, with local policing resources tied up to control public disorder. For example, on a typical Friday or Saturday night the police in a small town with licensed premises would be on alert for three to five hours, with possibly half of a divisional mobile support unit having to be drafted in to cope with the numbers. The approximate cost, totalling man-hours, local resources and extra units, is £250,000 a year.</p>
<p>It must also be noted that 60% of alcohol-related disturbances happen in the vicinity of licensed premises and that 16- to 24-year-old males are the highest risk group for alcohol-related violent crime. There is currently no legislation to enable the police to seize alcohol which is being consumed in public, except from young persons under the age of 18.</p>
<p>There is ambiguity about the use of the word &quot;consumption&quot;. Persons in possession of an open container of alcohol in a public place are not committing an offence. Prosecution can only take place if persons are observed consuming the liquid. The current legislation should be changed to allow a charge of possession with intent to consume alcohol. The police must be given the power to detect and prosecute those guilty of such an offence. That could take the form of fixed penalties and the power to confiscate alcohol. The police would then have the information on alcohol-related offences to maintain an up-to-date record and to provide continuing monitoring data. These records would merit inclusion in the police performance indicators for annual appraisal in each council area.</p>
<p>There is a real need to review the operation and application of alcohol by-laws in Northern Ireland. A single accountable body should be made responsible for enforcement and the prosecution of offenders. Logically, that body should be the police.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for the police to identify young persons who are under age and drinking alcohol. We all know that young persons now dress in as mature a manner as possible and look far older than they really are. An approved identity card scheme would go a long way to preventing young people under the age of 18 from obtaining alcohol.</p>
<p>It could take the form of a card that could be produced before purchasing alcohol from licensed premises or before entering a licensed establishment. After the production of approved documentation giving proof of age, local authorities could provide young people with free identification cards. To reduce fraud, the cards could be bar-coded or marked with a hologram.</p>
<p>An accredited scheme for training bar staff, door staff and staff in licensed premises, as set out in the document on the strategy for reducing alcohol-related harm, would be welcomed and should be implemented as soon as possible. The scheme could be co-ordinated by councils, but with centralised direction to ensure consistent standards.</p>
<p>We must pursue a Northern Ireland-wide education programme to alert younger people to the dangers of under-age drinking. I welcome the inclusion of that proposal in the strategy document. To ensure a consistent delivery of the education programme, it should be provided under the direction of the joint action group on drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>I refer again to the statistics for the United Kingdom in the ESPAD document. They show that young people &mdash; 15- to 16-year-olds &mdash; who use alcohol admitted to poor educational performance, to having accidents, to being injury prone, to having poor relationships with their parents, to becoming involved in scuffles and fights and to having unprotected sex after drinking. That last point is especially worrying: in Northern Ireland, there are many teenage pregnancies.</p>
<p>Alcohol-related disturbances, typically involving young men, are costing Northern Ireland dearly. The estimated total cost of alcohol-related harm for 1997-98 is £777 million. That is horrendous. Think of what could be done with that money; it could be much better used.</p>
<p>The strategy for reducing alcohol-related harm that was launched by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is a positive attempt to tackle alcohol abuse. It will have an impact on the two areas that I have spoken about today. I welcome the announcement that there will be joint implementation of the alcohol and drugs strategies, although such joint implementation requires adequate resources. The work of the RUC is an integral part of the strategy, and that fact should be openly accepted. The police have to control public disturbances and deal with other offences resulting from alcohol misuse. There is an urgent need for a review of the alcohol by-laws in Northern Ireland. The required resources should be forthcoming.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.7.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90028" speakername="Mrs Annie Courtney" time="16:15" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#7">
<p>I congratulate the Member on bringing this matter to the attention of the Assembly. We are only too aware of the increase in alcohol-related crime, including not only attacks on individuals but attacks on property, cars and businesses. Doctors in accident and emergency departments are constantly dealing with injuries resulting from domestic violence that is fuelled by drink or drugs.</p>
<p>Alcohol is the most abused drug but because it is socially acceptable it is seldom seem as such. Often, a blind eye is turned to alcohol abuse. Most major cities have by-laws that address the problem of outdoor drinking. The enforcement of those laws by local authorities is the difficult part. Council officers must go to court to prosecute. The police arrest individuals and gather evidence, but local councils must decide whether to prosecute.</p>
<p>One of the main problems in the area covered by my local authority &mdash; Derry City Council &mdash; is that it is often the habitual drinker &mdash; or wino &mdash; who is brought to court. The fine is derisory, but bringing the case to court is expensive, and it is time-consuming for council officers. Frequently, the offenders who should have been brought before the court are missed. If they are charged, the courts often show leniency, and the offences continue.</p>
<p>By-laws must apply to designated areas, and a blanket ban is unenforceable without adequate resources. Glasgow has such a policy, but in my area it was felt that this policy would not work. Support for such a policy must come not only from the community but from the police. If more resources were available to councils they could employ officers to enforce the policy and bring perpetrators of drink-related crime to court.</p>
<p>By-laws can be easily overcome by moving on-street drinkers to another area where they can laugh at those trying to enforce the policy &mdash; which often happens. The support of statutory agencies such as the education and library boards, health and social services boards and those involved in the treatment of young alcoholics is necessary if we are to raise the awareness of the public and get its support. That is why I support the motion and ask for the legislation to be amended and more resources to be made available. A Province-wide education programme is needed to address the problem once and for all, and we must make the by-laws and legislation adequate.</p>

<p>Mrs Carson, who moved the motion, and Mrs Courtney mentioned some of the deficiencies in the legislation and by-laws. I know from experience in North Belfast and as a city councillor that there are problems with enforcing the law. The issue comes up time and again for councils. People say that the by-laws are not effective, but the fact is that the legislation is inadequate.</p>
<p>Mrs Carson mentioned a couple of areas of concern. For example, if the police find someone with an open container of alcohol and know that that person has been drinking outside a designated drinking area, there is nothing they can do unless they catch the person in the act or he or she is an under-age drinker. That brings the law into total disrepute. Much money is spent by local authorities on putting up signs that say &quot;No Drinking&quot;, and to a great extent that is a token effort at tackling the problem. I once asked my local authority in Belfast about the number of people who had been convicted of offences in relation to the by-laws, and the number was paltry.</p>
<p>Another area of concern is that although many streets and parks in any borough or council are designated as areas where people cannot drink, the by-laws cannot cover entire areas. That can lead to the problem simply being pushed from one area to another and people calling for their areas to be added to the list of designated areas. One school of thought says that a council should have the power to ensure that an entire area is covered by the by-laws.</p>
<p>The problem causes great concern, and it seems to be on the increase. People are entitled to consume alcohol if they wish, but we must draw the line at heavy drinking in public areas, because it can lead to antisocial behaviour and other problems. Current legislation is inadequate.</p>
<p>I support what the motion says about an education programme. Sometimes we talk about enforcement and neglect education &mdash; these two elements must go hand in hand. Neither enforcement nor education on its own will solve the problem. As with litter, there is no point in simply fining people for dropping it; people must be educated so that they do not drop it in the first place.</p>
<p>I fully support the call for an education programme &mdash; or the enhancement of existing education programmes &mdash; and increased resources to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>Members have spoken about the need to have legislation amended. The problem is that the motion as currently worded does not call for legislation to be changed, although I think that that is the thrust behind it. The motion states that current levels of enforcement of the by-laws are inadequate, calls for increased resources and mentions a Province-wide education programme. However, I think that many Members &mdash; and the proposer of the motion, in her winding-up speech &mdash; will accept that the deficiency of legislation is a major issue. Perhaps some sort of amendment should be considered in relation to that. That may be what lies behind the thrust of the motion, although its wording is not explicit. I am happy to support the motion in so far as it goes, and I believe that the underlying message is that there is a need to examine the terms of the legislation itself.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.7.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90101" speakername="Ms Sue Ramsey" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#7">
<p>Go raibh maith agat. Members have mentioned the lack of resources available for education programmes. I agree. The issue is not just about people drinking in our streets; it is also about educating our young people &mdash; and those not so young &mdash; on the dangers of the misuse of alcohol.</p>
<p>Alcohol misuse creates massive social and family problems. Joan Carson rightly said that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has relaunched a strategy which, as the Minister said in answer to a question in April, is aimed at reducing adult alcohol problems. The strategy commits the Department to three objectives: encouraging a sensible approach to drinking, promoting effective treatment services and protecting individuals and communities from the damage caused by alcohol misuse.</p>
<p>The majority of on-street drinking is done by young people. They are likely to be under age and therefore cannot purchase alcohol legally. We need to ask where they get this drink. We are aware that some adults make money by purchasing alcohol from off-licences for these young people. That happens in towns and cities across the North. Some young people produce fake identification, and others get dolled up to the nines to appear older than they are.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether people are aware that in my own area, west Belfast, my party and several community groups and local drinking establishments were involved in setting up a community off-sales initiative. It was a pilot scheme to encourage the community and the off-licences to tackle the issue of under-age drinking and the associated problem of on-street drinking. We were encouraged by the response of the off-licences, the community groups involved and the wider community. The off-licences agreed to require identification and not to sell drink to people unless they were over 21 years of age. Those involved in off-sales say that they are losing some of their profit, but they do not mind because they are playing a part in helping the community to tackle the wider problem.</p>
<p>We must develop an approach to tackle alcohol abuse through peer education and through educational programmes in our schools. The role of the education system has been mentioned. We need to target and attack the culture of drinking. Drink is promoted in big neon lights. Adults set the tone. The behaviour of adults can encourage or discourage our young people. Young people need to learn about the dangers of alcohol misuse.</p>
<p>I know it has been touched on earlier, but, as an overall co-ordinated approach, we need to deal with people who sell alcohol and adults who make money by encouraging young people to drink. We need a co-ordinated approach to the advertising of alcohol. Alcohol creates damage in the family, and in the social and community sector. We need to say that it is not a glamour issue.</p>
<p>I support the comments of Joan Carson. I was alarmed by the statistics she and Annie Courtney referred to with regard to the money spent on hospital-related incidents around alcohol misuse. We also need to look at fixed- penalty fines. Annie Courtney did mention that the winos seem to be more likely to end up in court. We need to take on board whether these fixed-penalty fines work. Usually these people have little or no money anyway, so where do they go? Are we creating a vicious circle? We need a long-term, strategic, co-ordinated approach to tackle the whole issue, not only of under-age drinking but also of alcohol misuse. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/ni/2001-06-25.7.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/90013" speakername="Mrs Eileen Bell" time="16:30" url="http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports/010625.htm#7">
<p>I support the motion and the comments made by Mrs Carson in her comprehensive speech. It is an unfortunate fact of life that, unlike most other countries where pavement cafes are encouraged, the situation in Northern Ireland militates against this. It does not lend itself to the often delightful practice of open-air drinking, even in such organised legal establishments as cafe bars, and so on &mdash; certainly in my area. Our primary objective must be to strenuously oppose the many, often illegal, forms of largely under-age open-air drinking.</p>
<p>In my constituency of North Down, outdoor drinking occurs on a regular basis throughout the area &mdash; unchecked on most occasions. The RUC maintains that its problem is undermanning, resulting in an inability to enforce the law. Therefore, the reputation of the RUC is the first to suffer, and the problem gets worse. The situation on the streets of central Bangor at the weekends is such that many of the youth of the town head into Belfast and other places for their entertainment. Very few residents of any age would dare to venture onto the seafront or High Street areas after dark. This cannot be allowed to continue. Also, when some of the drinkers are moved away from the seafront into the suburbs, the elderly there live in fear of their houses being wrecked, or worse. It makes life very difficult, both for residents and tourists.</p>
<p>A more active enforcement role is required, and this may take many forms, including education, which has been mentioned by other Members. Also, much more concerted action by the RUC, with the support of other agencies and stronger legislation, is first and foremost on my and my constituents&rsquo; list. It is really a case of having a good working partnership between councils, the RUC and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety with its different strategies, as Sue Ramsey mentioned. When this partnership works, it ensures that the dangers of drinking in public places, drink-driving, burglary, vandalism, and so on are recognised by all sections of the community as serious breaches of the law.</p>
<p>The continuing sale of alcohol to people under the legal age limit is also something that needs to be more rigorously investigated &mdash; again, a measure requiring the attention of the RUC &mdash; although, as Sue Ramsey pointed out, there are more community initiatives. That is very welcome. Those found selling alcohol to under-age persons should be put out of business immediately, if possible. We must strengthen and implement the legislation effectively so that the RUC and other agencies have the appropriate support. We have to cut down the supply of alcohol as much as possible. We need to arrest those who still insist on flouting the law and prosecute them with the full might of the law. We must ensure that the courts not only are able to sentence them effectively and severely but also are charged to do so to a much greater degree than they tend to do at present with the few who are brought before them.</p>
<p>I agree with Nigel Dodds. The position is comparable to that of people who fail to buy dog licences, or to prevent their dogs from soiling the streets. When they are brought to court, the magistrates consider the matter to be too small and simply fine them. We must get out of that mindset. We can make major headway towards greatly reducing the blight on our society if the motion is passed and the attention of the relevant authorities is drawn to it. I support the motion.</p>

<p>I support the motion and congratulate Mrs Carson on the excellent manner in which she proposed it. Not one constituency represented in the Assembly has been free from the blight brought about by the increasing problem of outdoor drinking. It is reaching epidemic proportions throughout Northern Ireland, and even in those areas where the local authorities have attempted to take some action, law enforcement is difficult. The problems are compounded by the fact that the already hard-pressed members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary do not have enough resources. They are struggling with major problems such as domestic crime and the increased terrorist threat, and unfortunately alcohol abuse is fairly low on their list of priorities. It is only when this kind of activity takes on the magnitude of some of the incidents that have occurred in the Queen&rsquo;s University area, where many people drink excessively, continue to do so on the streets and then start to fight, that it becomes a major problem for the security forces and the RUC.</p>
<p>Mrs Carson&rsquo;s motion proposes attempts to educate young people in order that we may in the future help to alleviate the problem or remove it from society. Probably most people, and particularly those with young families, are conscious of the fact that there is increased pressure on our young people through television, magazine and newspaper advertising. Alcohol has been glamorised and made fashionable, and it represents something desirable for young people.</p>
<p>There was good reason for the banning of tobacco advertising, and urgent attention and serious consideration should be given to the promotion of alcohol. As the father of a young girl, I am aware that children are taken up with advertising such as that for Budweiser and the vodka ads that are made to look glamorous or have catchphrases that even the youngest child starts to parrot and mimic. It shows the impact of unscrupulous people who have only financial gain in mind. These large companies that promote alcohol are not targeting older age groups, who have already determined the type or brand of alcohol they are going to use. They are carefully and clearly targeting the younger market that will be coming on stream in a few years&rsquo; time. I particularly welcome the opportunity that may be created when someone is appointed as an ombudsman for children&rsquo;s affairs &mdash; a matter referred to in a previous debate. This matter should be given top priority in our attempts to prevent our children being subjected to this type of abuse &mdash; it can be described as nothing else.</p>
<p>In closing, I congratulate Mrs Carson on tabling the motion, and I am delighted that we have an opportunity to support it.</p>

<p>I am sorry that more Members cannot be available for this important debate. I warmly commend and congratulate my Colleague Joan Carson on bringing the matter to the attention of the Assembly. It gives this issue necessary attention, which is very timely. As Members have already said, we have all been faced with problems in relation to illegal outdoor drinking in our districts. The problem of enforcement is a major task confronting everyone. Current legislation is clearly unsatisfactory. It necessitates someone being caught in the act of consuming alcohol. Apparently, it is not enough to catch someone with a glass or bottle in their hand; they must be partaking. That has been a major flaw in the current legislation.</p>
<p>I am interested to know &mdash; and Mrs Carson may be able to shed some light on this &mdash; who has overall responsibility for the matter. Is it the Minister of the Environment because of his responsibilities for local government, or is it the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety? In any education programme, it is important that there is joined-up government and that all bodies with input into helping resolve these matters give consideration to them.</p>
<p>Enforcement is a serious problem. It has already been said that it is not possible or practicable to expect the RUC to be at every street corner or town centre. However, the problems created by illegal drinking in open places now dog many town centres, which are not now being inhabited by the &quot;right&quot; kind of people, so to speak. Largely speaking, many of our larger towns have become ghost towns, particularly at night. The only people found in them are winos and people with serious alcohol- and other substance- related problems. We should remember that we have a responsibility for those people too &mdash; to give them proper care and attention, and to try to ensure that we lead them away from those activities and give them better opportunities in life.</p>
<p>In my constituency of Newry and Armagh, and indeed in the district council area of Newry and Mourne, there are local initiatives such as pubs with no beer. That might sound unusual to some Members, but experiments are being tried to alert young people to the dangers of alcohol. It is one thing to be in a party mood or quite sociable, but it can lead to serious addiction and to the most serious social problems.</p>
<p>I am bound to say that there is parental responsibility in this area. It is crucial that parents are aware of where their children are and who they are with, and that they put parental influence at a premium.</p>
<p>I welcome the fact that the Government did not propose to introduce legislation in the Queen&rsquo;s Speech to extend the opening hours of public houses and make drink more readily available, as was advocated by some very misinformed people, on a 24-hour basis. More than enough alcohol can already be bought and consumed. Extending the licensing hours would only exacerbate many of our social problems. We should consider restricting the opening hours of places where alcohol is sold, particularly if it is being sold to people who are under age. There should be severe sanctions against the owners and proprietors of such establishments.</p>
<p>I welcome the motion. It is timely and should be brought to the attention of the relevant Ministers and their Committees, so that appropriate legislation can be framed and the Assembly can make a contribution to society. That will be a positive result that will help us to deal with this intractable problem.</p>

<p>I thank all those who remained for the debate after a hectic period earlier. It shows that they feel that the matter is important. If other Members take time to read Hansard, they will see that we have a big problem in all constituencies whose Members have spoken. We have a problem common to all: not a town, village, area or townland is free from under-age drinking and the accessibility of drink. Mrs Courtney said that the blanket ban was unenforceable, but it is something we must think about &mdash; either a ban or some other way of dealing with the problem throughout Northern Ireland. Mrs Courtney also brought up something that I had forgotten about &mdash; the pressure that is put on our hospital services at the weekend &mdash; and I welcome that.</p>
<p>Nigel Dodds said that the by-laws are not adequate, and I agree with him about signage. We have the country covered with no-drinking zones, yet nobody takes any heed. The legislation requires amendment.</p>
<p>I was interested in what Sue Ramsey said about her area of west Belfast and the pilot scheme. Some people are doing that in local areas, and it is very commendable. Danny Kennedy said much the same, and that is fine in particular areas, but we need an overall response on this.</p>
<p>Eileen Bell talked about the fear generated at weekends. In a local village in my country area there is an atmosphere of fear caused by drinking. Cedric Wilson talked about television advertisements and the pressures on young people. The banning of tobacco advertising was a good suggestion and something to be considered &mdash; perhaps not by the Assembly, but other places could ban television advertisements. Those advertisements target young people, and once they have them hooked on alcopops and such things, they have customers for the rest of their days.</p>
<p>To tackle the problem sensibly, the present by-laws need to be amended to include powers to confiscate alcohol being consumed in public. A clearer definition is needed of what is meant by the possession of, or consumption of, alcohol in public. The power to prosecute offenders should be withdrawn from councils, but there should be a liaison role for them with the RUC.</p>
<p>Stricter control of the licensing of establishments that sell alcohol would be useful, as would an accredited Province-wide training scheme for staff of bars and off-licences. It might be considered mandatory for businesses to be included in this scheme as a condition to obtaining a licence or a licence renewal.</p>
<p>A Province-wide scheme to provide identity cards for those over 18 years of age might reduce the incidence of alcohol purchase by under-age customers. A valid identity card could be used as a proof of identity in situations other than the under-age purchase of alcohol. The co-ordinated approach suggested in the document on the strategy for reducing alcohol-related harm should include direct co-ordination and co-operation with the RUC. If the statistics on alcohol-related harm were combined, councils, the Assembly and the public could be made aware of the human and monetary costs involved.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. This is a complex subject, and the debate highlighted the problems we have to address. I ask that the points made today be noted and acted on by the Departments concerned.</p>
<p>Mr Kennedy has asked which Department has overall jurisdiction on this matter. I cannot answer that. The Department of Education, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of the Environment could all work together to develop appropriate legislation to address effectively the problems of drinking in public, under-age drinking, the resultant disturbances and social problems. I ask that the motion be supported.</p>
<p class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p class="italic">Resolved:</p>
<p class="small">That this Assembly believes that current levels of enforcement of alcohol by-laws are inadequate to address the problem of outdoor drinking; and that increased resources should be made available for the enforcement of the by-laws and for a Province-wide education programme to alert younger people to the dangers of under-age drinking.</p>
<p class="italic">Adjourned at 4.57 pm.</p>
