	Northern Ireland: Security Vetting
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-04-05b.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="79"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050405/text/50405-46.htm#50405-46_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.79.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/2">In December 2002 my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced a review of security vetting arrangements in Northern Ireland, with the aim of ensuring that these were effective; proportionate; compliant with human rights and other statutory requirements; and in line with UK-wide best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/3">The review, which has involved representatives from government departments, the police and security agencies, and government legal services, has now completed its detailed work. I have accepted its recommendations, which have improved security vetting procedures through the following significant changes:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/4" class="indent">a range of enhancements to protective security in the areas of personnel, physical and IT security;</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/5" class="indent">an increased focus on risks and improved safeguards in vulnerable areas, enabling a major reduction in the number of posts requiring vetting on grounds of national security across government while improving, through better use of resources, the protective security of key areas; and</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/6" class="indent">the introduction, now under way, of internal appeal processes for existing employees against the refusal or withdrawal of national security vetting clearances, to provide better transparency and fairness.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/7">I believe that these are positive steps which will both promote confidence in the equality of opportunity afforded by government employment, and improve the protections for and integrity of important government activities and public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/8">The Government attach particular importance to addressing all aspects of protective security. The work to drive the changes forward will continue. It is essential that in Northern Ireland, as in the UK as a whole, sound protective security regimes are in place to protect vulnerable and critically important public functions and activities from the whole range of threats, including domestic and international terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-03">3 February 2004</phrase> I received a report from the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC).

	<p pid="b.79.3/4">I announced in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase> that I was minded to remove for a period Sinn Fein's entitlement to financial assistance payable to political parties in Northern Ireland.

The new allocations represent an increase of &pound;1.34 million over the initial gross budget set at April 2004. This increase will be funded through higher loan recoveries, plus an increase in net Treasury funding of &pound;0.68 million for this year. This &pound;0.68 million is the third and final instalment of the increases to the discretionary social fund announced in the autumn 2002 Pre-Budget Report.</p>

	<p pid="b.81.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/2">I am pleased to announce the approval of additional DfID funding of up to &pound;23.8 million to the Microbicide Development Programme (MDP). The MDP is co-ordinated by the UK Medical Research Council's clinical trials unit and Imperial College, London. This funding will enable the completion of a phase III clinical trial of one of the leading candidates for a microbicide protecting against HIV infection.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/3">The potential benefits of an effective microbicide are very significant. Research has shown that an effective microbicide could prevent up to 2.5 million infections worldwide over three years. Microbicides, prepared in the form of a gel, provide a potential means for women to protect themselves against infection.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/4">This investment is part of the Government's strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world, as set out in <i>Taking Action</i> published in July 2004.</p>
