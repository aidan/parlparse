	<p pid="a.105.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2">Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires me to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on my exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">The 2005 Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. During the third period (<phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase>) I made four orders on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November 2005</phrase> and one order on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase>, all five were made with the permission of the court under Section 3 (l)(a) of the 2005 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">There are eight control orders currently in force.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">During the period I have refused two requests to modify control order obligations. A right of appeal exists in Section 10 of the 2005 Act against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an obligation contained in a control order. This has not been exercised in respect of these refusals.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions Reform (Stephen Timms) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/2">I have today placed in the Library the latest quarterly progress report on pension credit, with figures to the end of September. The report gives the number of households and individuals receiving pension credit overall, broken down by the guarantee credit and savings credit and by Government Office region and parliamentary constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/3">The total number of households receiving pension credit at <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase> was 2.71 million, or around 3.30 million individuals. The average weekly award is now &pound;43.54.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/4">The figures show that there were just under 2.1 million households, or 2.48 million individuals, getting pension credit guarantee awards as at <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/5">In future, pension credit caseload figures will be incorporated within the national statistics reporting framework. The multi-benefit release of national statistics in January 2006, including detailed pension credit figures for August 2005 will also include provisional headline pension credit statistics for November 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/6">Copies of the report are also available for honourable Members in the Vote Office.</p>
