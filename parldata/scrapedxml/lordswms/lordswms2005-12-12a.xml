	<p pid="a.105.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2">Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires me to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on my exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">The 2005 Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. During the third period (<phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase>) I made four orders on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November 2005</phrase> and one order on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase>, all five were made with the permission of the court under Section 3 (l)(a) of the 2005 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">There are eight control orders currently in force.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">During the period I have refused two requests to modify control order obligations. A right of appeal exists in Section 10 of the 2005 Act against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an obligation contained in a control order. This has not been exercised in respect of these refusals.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/2">The Government are committed to ensuring that the pledges on Africa and development made at the G8 Summit at Gleneagles in July are implemented, and progress has already been made. At the international level, implementation will be monitored by the Africa Partnership Forum, as well as by the G8 group of countries and the EU. The Gleneagles implementation plan for Africa&mdash;a copy of which I am placing in both Libraries&mdash;sets out the Government's views on the key milestones which need to be achieved on Africa and development in the 12 months following the Gleneagles Summit. I am pleased that some of these have already been achieved, and the Government are working with their partners in developed and developing countries to ensure that the remainder are achieved as quickly as possible. This plan will be updated monthly as further progress is made.</p>
