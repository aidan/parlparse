	<p pid="b.75.1/1">A General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) was held on <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr. Jack Straw) and the Minister for Europe (Douglas Alexander) chaired the council as presidency. The Minister for Europe also represented the UK on certain agenda items.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/2">The agenda items were covered as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/3" class="italic">Report on Informal Heads of State/Government meeting (Hampton Court, <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>)</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/4">The presidency presented the six remits from Hampton Court: research and development, universities, demographic challenge, energy, migration, and the common foreign and security policy/European security and defence policy (CFSP/ESDP). The Commission said that it would take forward the first five remits, in consultation with the current and future presidencies. The high representative, in association, where appropriate, with the presidency, the future presidency and the European Commission, agreed to take forward work in the area of CFSP/ESDP.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/5"><i>World Trade Organisation (WTO)/Doha Development Agenda (DDA)</i> Following up the extensive GAERC discussion and agreed conclusions of <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>, Commissioner Mandelson updated the council on the state of play in the DDA negotiations in the light of its recent conditional offer and forthcoming meetings among WTO members. The Commission confirmed that it was continuing to act within its mandate and would continue to ensure that the council was fully informed of developments in the negotiations. The council also agreed, as an A point, conclusions noting support for Saudi accession to the WTO.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/6"><i>Financial Perspectives 2007&ndash;13</i> The council exchanged views on the EU's budget for 2007&ndash;13 and identified the areas that will need to be addressed in order for the presidency to reach an agreement at the 15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase> European Council: (i) the structure of EU spending; (ii) modernising the budget, including a timetable for review; and (iii) the system of EU own resources. The presidency concluded that work on those areas should continue and that it would return to the issue at the 21&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase> GAERC.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/7"><i>Belarus</i> The presidency introduced the item noting the deteriorating situation on human rights and political freedoms in Belarus. High Representative Solana underlined the difficulty faced by the EU in trying to bring about reform. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner agreed, noting the efforts to realign aid towards support for civil society. A large number of delegations expressed concern at the deteriorating situation and highlighted the need to intensify contact and support to civil society. The council also noted the importance of free and fair presidential elections in 2006 and called for the Belarusian Government to issue an early invitation to an OSCE/ODIHR monitoring mission. The council expressed willingness to take appropriate restrictive measures against responsible individuals in the event of a failure to uphold international standards. Council conclusions were agreed that committed the council to a further GAERC discussion in January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/8"><i>Kosovo</i> Over lunch, the council held a discussion with Martti Ahtisaari, the UN Secretary-General's future Kosovo status envoy. Ahtisaari welcomed EU involvement in the status process and gave an initial indication of how he intended to take forward his mandate. He also flagged the importance of addressing Kosovo's poor economic situation. High Representative Solana nominated Stefan Lehne as EU representative to the Kosovo status process. The council expressed strong support for Ahtisaari's appointment and endorsement of Stefan Lehne as EU representative. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/9"><i>Iran</i> The council reviewed the EU's overall relations with Iran. It condemned President Ahmadinejad's reported remarks calling for Israel to be wiped from the map. They agreed that recent developments had been discouraging in the EU's main areas of concern, including Iran's approach to WMD and terrorism, the human rights situation, and Iran's policies towards the Middle East peace process and regional issues. They noted the importance of the EU/Iran comprehensive dialogue and urged Iran to take steps to resume substantive discussions under the EU/Iran human rights dialogue and to demonstrate by its actions that it was willing to improve respect for human rights. They agreed to keep the EU's relations with Iran under close review. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/10"><i>Syria/Lebanon</i> The council underlined the significance of the unanimity achieved on UN Security Council Resolution 1636 on Syrian and reviewed progress on the implementation of UNSCR 1559. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/11"><i>MEPP</i> The council discussed an invitation from James Wolfensohn, quartet special envoy for disengagement, on behalf of Israel and the Palestinian Authority for the EU to play a monitoring role at Rafah on the Egypt-Gaza border. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and High Representative Solana highlighted that an EU role in this area would help build confidence. In discussion, member states supported the idea of EU involvement in a non-executive monitoring role. This was the fruit of a continuous effort on the ground, which would reinforce the EU's political role. The presidency concluded that there was a general endorsement for the proposals by the high representative and the Commission. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/12"><i>Iraq</i> The council agreed conclusions that welcomed the <phrase class="date" code="">15 October</phrase> referendum on the Iraqi constitution.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/13"><i>UN World Summit follow-up</i> The presidency introduced this item, noting that effective follow-up to the UN summit was a priority for the EU. Member states highlighted certain aspects such as the Peacebuilding Commission, Human Rights Council and counter-terrorism as key areas for urgent action. The council agreed extensive conclusions that set out the agreed EU position on all the key areas of summit implementation.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/14"><i>Avian Flu</i> The presidency introduced the item, noting the earlier discussion at the GAERC on <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>. The Commission noted that work within the EU was well advanced. The council agreed conclusions that detailed the range of work under way, including a comprehensive action plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/15"><i>AoB: Colombia</i> Dutch Foreign Minister Bot highlighted the importance of EU support for the peace process in Colombia. The presidency noted that the <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase> GAERC had agreed conclusions on support for the peace process in Colombia, which set the framework for EU policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/16"><i>AoB: Cuba</i> The Czech Republic highlighted the problems faced by its embassy in Havana in celebrating their national day.</p>
