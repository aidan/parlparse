	NHS: Foundation Trusts
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-05-02a.31.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="31"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60502-32.htm#60502-32_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.31.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Liam Byrne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/2">The chairman of Monitor (the statutory name of which is the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts) announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase> that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, Monitor had decided to authorise the following NHS mental health trusts to operate as NHS foundation trusts from <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-01">1 May 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/3" class="indent">Oxleas NHS Trust</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/4" class="indent">South Essex Partnership NHS Trust</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/5" class="indent">South Staffordshire Healthcare NHS Trust</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/6">Monitor's announcement marks the first group of mental health trusts becoming authorised as NHS foundation trusts and will enable these trusts to take advantage of the new freedoms available to them to improve services for their communities and innovate new approaches to patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/7">A fourth applicant, North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust, has deferred its application at this time. Monitor will remain in contact with the trust although ultimately it is for the trust to decide when it wishes to return to Monitor's assessment process.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/8">Monitor's announcement brings the total number of NHS foundation trusts to 35. A copy of Monitor's press notice has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/9">The Government remain committed to offering all NHS acute and mental health trusts the opportunity to apply for foundation status as soon as practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/10">A further six trusts are being considered by Monitor for authorisation by <phrase class="date" code="">1 June 2006</phrase>, and a further 14 are being considered for authorisation by <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase>. This will complete the second wave of foundation trust applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.3/2">Further to the Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-21">21 December 2004</phrase> by the right honourable Des Browne, then Minister of State for the Home Office, announcing the proposed introduction from late 2006 of interviews for adult first-time passport applicants, I have placed a document in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament setting out the plans to establish 69 new offices in which interviews will take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/3">The document sets out the planned 69 locations for the interview offices. However, exactly where the offices will be located within the 69 towns and cities will not be known until the acquisition process is completed. The document also outlines the new procedures for the applications concerned, and the consultation and design process undertaken by the Identity and Passport Service in deciding on the locations. It also describes the work in progress to establish arrangements for those living in remote areas.</p>
