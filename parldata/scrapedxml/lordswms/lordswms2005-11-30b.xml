<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-30b.20.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="20"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51130-28.htm#51130-28_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.20.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and Minister for Women (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/2">The Informal EU Gender Equality Council hosted by the UK presidency took place in Birmingham on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November</phrase>. Together with ministerial colleagues Meg Munn and Baroness Crawley I chaired that meeting, which included visits to innovative community projects from across the West Midlands tackling the problems of gender inequality.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/3">In addition to 15 Ministers from across Europe with responsibility for gender equality, I was delighted to welcome Rachel Mayanja, the UN Secretary-General's special adviser on gender equality and the advancement of women; Anna Zaborska, chair of the European Parliament's Women's Committee; and Vladimir Spidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">Tuesday 8 November</phrase>, Ministers were divided into groups to visit community projects brought together in two venues in Birmingham. My colleague Meg Munn visited a community arts centre called the Custard Factory, and I hosted the other group of Ministers, who visited a converted pub in Balsall Heath, now a thriving centre of education as part of South Birmingham College. At each venue we had the opportunity to talk to women about their projects and to learn about good practice in the United Kingdom. The areas covered by the projects included rural enterprise, education and training, business start-ups, confidence-raising, gender equality in the business world and the promotion of technology and enterprise for young girls.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/5">A number of Ministers commented that they found that part of the informal council to be the most innovative, as it gave them a chance to speak to individual women who had experienced various forms of disadvantage and to hear their stories.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/6">On the second day, after a short welcome speech from Meg Munn, Ministers broke into three small groups chaired by the UK, Austria and Finland (the current and two succeeding presidencies) for detailed discussions and an exchange of good practice. These discussions were based on questions prepared by the presidency and sent to the Ministers in advance. The three themes flowed from the preceding gender equality Conference. These were: Breaking the Barriers, which included issues such as breaking down traditional stereotypes of women's work and occupational segregation, the kind of support needed for women entrepreneurs and using taxation and incentive policies to break employment barriers; Making Work Work, covering successful work-life balance initiatives, childcare and how women can achieve economic security in retirement; and Getting In, Getting On, covering educational initiatives aimed at inspiring girls to aim high in their professional lives, how women can update and expand their skills throughout their lives and the gender pay gap and how it can be abolished.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/7">Discussions in those groups were lively and informative, aided in part by the smaller numbers of participants. In the subsequent plenary session, each chair reported back on some of the key issues discussed and highlighted examples of good practice that were shared in their group. In discussion, Ministers agreed that the key issues affecting gender equality include:</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/8" class="indent">the demographic challenge, meaning that people were living longer and having fewer children;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/9" class="indent">the gender pay gap;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/10" class="indent">occupational segregation;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/11" class="indent">the need for increased involvement of men in caring responsibilities and domestic tasks;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/12" class="indent">the low status and consequent lower pay of many women's jobs;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/13" class="indent">women's lower pensions caused by interrupted working patterns and lower pay;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/14" class="indent">better quality and greater provision of childcare; and</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/15" class="indent">flexible working patterns and reconciliation of work-life balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/16">During the ministerial meeting, a number of speakers also identified the need to increase the number of women in the labour market if Europe is to increase economic growth, productivity and competitiveness. The links between that and the EU Lisbon strategy were made, with particular reference to retaining women in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/17">Ministers agreed that the opportunity to share and exchange practical examples of good practice that worked in their member states with other colleagues had been extremely useful and hoped that it could be built on in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/18">At the end of the meeting, a presidency statement was issued, which will be formally presented to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-09">9 December</phrase>. I attach a copy of the statement made by the UK presidency at the conclusion of the ministerial meeting on gender equality in Birmingham on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/19">Ten years ago, in Beijing, the United Nations drew up a declaration and a platform for action that has been the template for progress on gender equality ever since. The enthusiasm and commitment of the national delegates and representatives of civil society, who worked day and night on the text, helped to inspire the development within the European Union of a strong legislative base for gender equality and innovative policies for women's empowerment.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/20">Together, the Luxembourg and United Kingdom presidencies were determined to lead the EU to a strong reaffirmation of the declaration and platform for action to mark their tenth anniversary. This began with a conference and informal ministerial meeting in Luxembourg in February that reviewed progress in all EU member states towards the goals in the platform for action, and provided a comparative review of the institutional mechanisms for promoting gender equality within member states. The Luxembourg conference report provides an important basis for future comparative EU study, and the common ministerial declaration, adopted by Ministers of EU member states responsible for gender equality on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-04">4 February</phrase>, provides a strong statement of support for the Beijing platform for action.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/21">In March, the Luxembourg presidency led a very strong EU delegation to the 49th session of the Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations, where, in no small part due to the determination of the EU, we secured a full and universal reaffirmation of the Beijing declaration, with a renewed emphasis on the importance of gender equality for the achievement of the millennium development goals. These goals were reviewed at the millennium review summit in September, where the UK led the EU delegation.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/22">The outcome document of the summit makes even stronger linkages between the Beijing declaration and the MDGs, including a reference to making the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women, a central objective of relevant international policies as well as national development strategies, including those aimed at poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/23">Education and economic empowerment are key to promoting women's advancement in all the areas identified in the Beijing platform for action. An educated woman who has marketable skills and equal rights in the workplace can better resist discrimination in other arenas. Women, as 50 per cent of the EU population, offer great economic and social resources of creativity, entrepreneurship and community cohesion. But economic empowerment and gender equality require an effective legislative base and a wide range of policies, at national and local level and in business for success. Within the EU we now have a strong legislative base, with the conclusion of negotiations on the extension of protection against discrimination on the grounds of gender into the field of goods and services. Therefore at the UK presidency gender equality conference and ministerial meeting in Birmingham we concentrated on sharing our experience of practical interventions and policy initiatives that deliver economic empowerment for women and gender equality for women and men.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/24">Alongside practical examples from many EU member states, generously shared by representatives from governments, business, trade unions, academics and civil society, we also considered ideas that have been successful in the developing world. And Ministers, prior to their own very valuable discussions, visited community projects based in the West Midlands&mdash;several funded by the EU&mdash;to see how local initiatives can make a significant difference to the economic chances of disadvantaged women, particularly to those experiencing multiple discrimination. These projects working with the specific needs of minority ethnic women, women in business, training and education of women, young female entrepreneurs, women facing social exclusion and support for women in rural enterprise represent a microcosm of the complexity and diversity of issues faced by women in their everyday lives across Europe and highlight the challenges faced by policy- and decision-makers to achieving full gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/25">We were strongly influenced in our work by the mid-term review of the EU Lisbon strategy. That strategy recognises overtly that gender equality and the advancement of women are fundamental to the achievement of full employment, sustained economic growth and social cohesion, as well as the promotion of knowledge and innovation in Europe, the reinforcement of social protection and the eradication of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/26">We encourage all member states to ensure that their future annual Lisbon implementation reports, which will report on their national reform programmes for 2005&ndash;08, are fully mainstreamed&mdash;in particular that any targets and data are disaggregated by gender; that the goals of women's employment and the provision of good childcare are properly resourced and that the integrated guidelines on growth and jobs for 2005&ndash;08 are heeded, with particular reference to Guideline No. 18: promoting a lifecycle approach to work. The EU Lisbon strategy must be achieved by full acknowledgement of the importance of gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/27">The EU made a firm commitment, renewed in Luxembourg in February, to continue its work on different aspects of the Beijing platform for action by the development and collection of helpful and relevant indicators. It was also agreed that this year no new specific indicators would be developed, so that member states could focus on implementation of the platform in its entirety. In 2006 this work will recommence under the leadership of the Austrian and Finnish presidencies, including a focus on gender equality health indicators. However, in due course, that will be greatly assisted as a result of work done under Luxembourg and the UK this year on the establishment of the European Gender Institute. This and the recast directive that simplifies and streamlines the existing gender equality <i>acquis</i> have been the primary focus of our work in council.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/28">The presidency is proud of the EU's record of achievements in the field of gender equality but is all too well aware of the work that remains to be done. We believe that our emphasis at the presidency conference and ministerial meeting in Birmingham on women's economic empowerment in the context of the Beijing Declaration and the Lisbon strategy is important and has provided the opportunity for significant and purposeful conversations between practitioners from across the EU and more widely. We are pleased that the European Commission plans to reprise the theme of women's employment and work-life balance as the central part of its Third Annual Report to Heads of State and Government, to be presented at the spring council in March 2006. This UK presidency statement will be presented to the Employment, Health and Social Affairs Council for consideration on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-09">9 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/1">The General Affairs and External Relations council (GAERC) was held on 21 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-22">22 November</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw), the Defence Secretary (John Reid), and the International Development Secretary (Hilary Benn) chaired the council as presidency. My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Douglas Alexander) also represented the UK on certain agenda items.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/3">Defence Ministers</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/4" class="italic">Capabilities</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/5">The council approved the final Requirements Catalogue 05, which identifies the EU's military capability requirements and puts renewed emphasis on rapidly deployable, sustainable and interoperable armed forces. The catalogue was validated using computer-assisted operational analysis provided by NATO. Two further battlegroups were announced (Greece-Romania-Bulgaria-Cyprus and a Czech-Slovak group), which ensured the roster was filled to the end of 2008. Progress on capability development initiatives including battlegroups, the European Gendarmerie Force and the maritime dimension was welcomed. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/6" class="italic">Civil-military co-ordination</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/7">The work of the UK presidency in improving civil-military co-ordination, notably on comprehensive planning and security sector reform, was widely welcomed as a step towards bringing all the EU's instruments into a more effective holistic response. The Commission also supported this approach. Ministers agreed that this work should be applied to comprehensive reviews of the EU's engagement in Bosnia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and Aceh. The council also discussed the importance of EU support to building African peacekeeping capacity, and the EU's ability to respond rapidly to disasters.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/8" class="italic">European Defence Agency</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/9">The council welcomed the report by the head of the agency and agreed guidelines for the agency's work in 2006. Ministers exchanged views on the finalisation of administrative arrangements between the agency and Norway and Turkey. The presidency undertook to consult with those countries and return to the issue at the next opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/10" class="italic">Foreign and Defence Ministers: Bosnia</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/11">The council reviewed the EU military and police missions in Bosnia and agreed conclusions. It agreed that a continuing EU military presence was essential, with force levels broadly unchanged for the coming year. It established a follow-on police mission refocused to support police reform and the fight against organised crime, and agreed to strengthen the EU special representative's role in co-ordinating EU instruments. On the tenth anniversary of the initialling of the Dayton agreement, Ministers welcomed the progress made by Bosnia and authorised the Commission to open negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/12">Foreign Ministers</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/13" class="italic">Preparation for the 15-<phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December</phrase> European Council</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/14">The presidency introduced a draft annotated agenda and explained that Ministers would have a chance to consider draft European Council conclusions at the <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December</phrase> GAERC.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/15" class="italic">Financial Perspectives 2007&ndash;2013</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/16">The presidency introduced this item and highlighted that it remained committed to reaching a deal in December. The presidency highlighted the need to make progress in three main areas: (i) the structure of EU spending; (ii) modernising the budget, including a timetable for review; and (iii) resources. Significant changes would be needed to the proposals made in June by the Luxembourg presidency. The presidency highlighted plans for a Ministerial conclave on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-07">7 December</phrase>, ahead of which the presidency would table comprehensive proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/17" class="italic">WTO</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/18">The Commission set out the latest developments in the Doha round. On process, the Commission commented that they will continue to ensure transparency with member states and would consult the council fully at Hong Kong. Short conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/19" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/20">The presidency and High Representative Solana welcomed the agreement on the EU mission to monitor the Palestinian operation of the Rafah crossing point on the Gaza-Egypt border. The parties' acceptance of an international role was significant. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner highlighted that Commission capacity-building programmes would work hand-in-glove with the ESDP monitors. In preparation for the <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-25">25 January</phrase> Palestine Legislative Council (PLC) elections, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said an election observation mission would deploy in mid-December and would consist of 172 observers. Monitors would strictly limit their contacts to issues related to the observation of the elections. The presidency underlined the importance of the EU maintaining its position that observers should not enter into dialogue with Hamas until they renounced violence and recognised Israel. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/21" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/22">The Foreign Secretary briefed on his recent visit to Iraq (10 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-11">11 November</phrase>), highlighting that steady progress was being made. The Foreign Secretary emphasised the importance of the December elections, at which the Iraqis were keen for international observers. The council agreed that mounting a full EU election observation mission (EOM) would not be possible in the time available, but would explore what additional assistance it could provide in support of the <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December</phrase> elections. The council also agreed that the EU should be considering now how to prepare for closer relations with the new government next year. The presidency thanked the Commission for its work on the opening of a Commission Delegation in Baghdad. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said it was currently looking for a head of mission and, in addition, would shortly be submitting a draft negotiating mandate to member states for a trade and co-operation agreement with Iraq by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/23" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/24">The presidency updated the council on the <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-18">18 November</phrase> International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report. High Representative Solana highlighted the need to work closely with Mr El-Baradei and for the international community to stay firm and united. The presidency agreed that the issue remained difficult but it was important the European side actively supported a diplomatic solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/25" class="italic">Migration in External Relations</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/26">The council agreed council conclusions on migration in external relations and underlined their significance. The presidency noted the close interest taken by heads of government at Hampton Court on this issue. The Commission stressed the importance of better co-coordination of work between justice and home affairs, external relations and development and of increasing partnership with countries of origin and transit on migration issues. They particularly highlighted the need to improve engagement with sub-Saharan countries and to reinforce dialogue with neighbouring countries. The Commission also hoped that the reform of the financial instruments would enable it to respond more quickly and effectively to urgent migration-related situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/27" class="italic">EU Strategy for Africa</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/28">The council agreed conclusions on the Commission communication on the <i>EU-Africa Strategy: Towards a Euro-African Pact to Accelerate Africa's Development</i>. The communication will form an integral part of the overall EU strategy for Africa, which should be discussed and agreed by Foreign Ministers at the December GAERC and endorsed at the December European Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/29">During separate exchanges of views in preparation for the EU-Africa strategy, Foreign and Development Ministers identified the following priorities for the strategy: African ownership; mechanisms to monitor implementation of the strategy; increasing support for peace and security, including through a long-term commitment to the EU's African peace facility; good governance; trade and regional integration; establishing an EU-Africa infrastructure facility; meeting aid volume commitments and providing more assistance for health, education and the fight against AIDS; migration; environment; human rights; and economic partnership agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/30" class="italic">AOB&mdash;ASEM/Burma</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/31">The presidency highlighted the issue of Burmese participation at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) meetings and agreed that officials should take work forward and revert in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/32" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Cyprus</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/33">Sweden requested the presidency to update member states on plans for the Cyprus aid regulation. The presidency highlighted the urgency of agreeing the regulation and invited officials to take forward work before the next GAERC.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/34" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Bulgarian Medics</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/35">At the request of Bulgaria, who highlighted that the Libyan court of appeal was allowing a new hearing on the case of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff at the end of January. This might herald a positive evolution. The Bulgaria Foreign Minister thanked the presidency, the Commission and the member states for their efforts. The presidency offered continuing support to resolve this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/44">The council and Commission agreed &quot;The European Consensus on Development&quot;. This will be a joint declaration between the council, European Commission and European Parliament. It is divided into two parts: the first sets out common objectives and principles to guide the EU and its twenty-five member states in development, focused on poverty eradication and partner country ownership; and the second sets out the revised EC development policy which clarifies the Community's role and added value and ensures that priority attention be given to least developed and low income countries in resource allocation; and development shall be taken into account in other policies that affect developing countries. The European Parliament is expected to formally adopt the declaration in December.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/45" class="italic">Orientation Debate: Effectiveness of EU External Assistance</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/46">The council held its sixth annual &quot;Orientation Debate&quot; on improving the effectiveness of EU external action based on a presidency discussion paper.

	<p pid="b.31.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/2">The Government are today publishing a consultation paper on proposals for additional powers and responsibilities for the Greater London Authority (GLA)&mdash;the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/3">We believe the time is now right to look at giving the Mayor a greater say in the planning and delivery of London's strategic services while preserving the appropriate balance of power between the Mayor; Assembly and the boroughs. We are opening the door to significant decentralisation of powers from Whitehall, while ensuring the GLA remains a focused and strategic authority. We believe the GLA has proven its worth, and that the time is right to shift power from Whitehall to London. How far will depend on the response to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/4">The Government's consultation paper outlines a number of proposals for additional powers for the Mayor across a range of policy areas, including housing, learning and skills, planning and waste management and waste planning. It also explores options for additional powers for the London Assembly and changes in appointments to the boards of the four functional bodies in the GLA group.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/5">We look forward to hearing the views of Londoners and those with an interest in London during the consultation period, which will run until <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-22">22 February</phrase>. After considering all the responses to this consultation exercise, the Government will announce a final package of proposals in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/6">A copy of the consultation paper has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
