	Drug Use and HIV in the Developing World
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-30b.19.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="19"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51130-27.htm#51130-27_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.19.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/2">I am placing in the Libraries of both Houses copies of the new government paper <i>Harm Reduction: Tackling Drug use and HIV in the Developing world</i>. This paper is published by DfID today in conjunction with seven other government departments: the Cabinet Office, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department of Health, HM Treasury, the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/3">Drug injection with contaminated needles and syringes is one of the major means of transmission of HIV and hepatitis C in Europe, Asia and Latin America. It is also driving HIV transmission in North Africa and the Middle East and is becoming an increasing problem in Africa <sup>1</sup> . For example, in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, injecting drug use appears to be higher than has previously been realised.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/4">The paper primarily focuses on the prevention of drug-related harm, rather than the prevention of drug use per se. This includes reducing different kinds of harm, whether health, social and economic. In the context of HIV and other blood borne diseases, harm reduction aims to reduce the health and social consequences of injecting drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/5">There is substantial evidence about the effectiveness of harm reduction in preventing HIV infection among injecting drug users (IDUs), especially needle and syringe exchange programmes from many countries. For example in the UK and Australia HIV infection rates among injecting drug users are much lower (less than 2 per cent) than in countries without or with insufficient programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/6">Harm reduction programmes as part of a comprehensive plan for HIV prevention, treatment and care could save millions of lives every year.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/7">The Government view harm reduction as an important part of the overall HIV prevention strategy in countries with serious HIV epidemics among injecting drug users, as well as in countries without serious HIV epidemics where harm reduction helps maintain low prevalence rates. We are working across government to address this issue and have jointly agreed next steps. These are outlined in the paper, and cover: 1) the UK Government's understanding of harm reduction in the context of HIV; 2) the international approach for harm reduction; and 3) DfID's support and approach for harm reduction in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/8">DfID's approach focuses on piloting, or assisting in the national implementation of harm reduction including needle and syringe programmes, safer injecting, substitution therapy, social marketing of condoms, and peer education through government partners, and international and local NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.1/9">In implementing the approach set out in this paper we will continue to work in partnership with developing country governments, international agencies and donors, civil society, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the broader private sector and the research community.</p>

	EU Presidency: Gender Equality Council
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-30b.20.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="20"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51130-28.htm#51130-28_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.20.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and Minister for Women (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/2">The Informal EU Gender Equality Council hosted by the UK presidency took place in Birmingham on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="">9 November</phrase>. Together with ministerial colleagues Meg Munn and Baroness Crawley I chaired that meeting, which included visits to innovative community projects from across the West Midlands tackling the problems of gender inequality.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/3">In addition to 15 Ministers from across Europe with responsibility for gender equality, I was delighted to welcome Rachel Mayanja, the UN Secretary-General's special adviser on gender equality and the advancement of women; Anna Zaborska, chair of the European Parliament's Women's Committee; and Vladimir Spidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 8 November</phrase>, Ministers were divided into groups to visit community projects brought together in two venues in Birmingham. My colleague Meg Munn visited a community arts centre called the Custard Factory, and I hosted the other group of Ministers, who visited a converted pub in Balsall Heath, now a thriving centre of education as part of South Birmingham College. At each venue we had the opportunity to talk to women about their projects and to learn about good practice in the United Kingdom. The areas covered by the projects included rural enterprise, education and training, business start-ups, confidence-raising, gender equality in the business world and the promotion of technology and enterprise for young girls.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/5">A number of Ministers commented that they found that part of the informal council to be the most innovative, as it gave them a chance to speak to individual women who had experienced various forms of disadvantage and to hear their stories.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/6">On the second day, after a short welcome speech from Meg Munn, Ministers broke into three small groups chaired by the UK, Austria and Finland (the current and two succeeding presidencies) for detailed discussions and an exchange of good practice. These discussions were based on questions prepared by the presidency and sent to the Ministers in advance. The three themes flowed from the preceding gender equality Conference. These were: Breaking the Barriers, which included issues such as breaking down traditional stereotypes of women's work and occupational segregation, the kind of support needed for women entrepreneurs and using taxation and incentive policies to break employment barriers; Making Work Work, covering successful work-life balance initiatives, childcare and how women can achieve economic security in retirement; and Getting In, Getting On, covering educational initiatives aimed at inspiring girls to aim high in their professional lives, how women can update and expand their skills throughout their lives and the gender pay gap and how it can be abolished.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/7">Discussions in those groups were lively and informative, aided in part by the smaller numbers of participants. In the subsequent plenary session, each chair reported back on some of the key issues discussed and highlighted examples of good practice that were shared in their group. In discussion, Ministers agreed that the key issues affecting gender equality include:</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/8" class="indent">the demographic challenge, meaning that people were living longer and having fewer children;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/9" class="indent">the gender pay gap;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/10" class="indent">occupational segregation;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/11" class="indent">the need for increased involvement of men in caring responsibilities and domestic tasks;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/12" class="indent">the low status and consequent lower pay of many women's jobs;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/13" class="indent">women's lower pensions caused by interrupted working patterns and lower pay;</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/14" class="indent">better quality and greater provision of childcare; and</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/15" class="indent">flexible working patterns and reconciliation of work-life balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/16">During the ministerial meeting, a number of speakers also identified the need to increase the number of women in the labour market if Europe is to increase economic growth, productivity and competitiveness. The links between that and the EU Lisbon strategy were made, with particular reference to retaining women in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/17">Ministers agreed that the opportunity to share and exchange practical examples of good practice that worked in their member states with other colleagues had been extremely useful and hoped that it could be built on in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/18">At the end of the meeting, a presidency statement was issued, which will be formally presented to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>. I attach a copy of the statement made by the UK presidency at the conclusion of the ministerial meeting on gender equality in Birmingham on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/19">Ten years ago, in Beijing, the United Nations drew up a declaration and a platform for action that has been the template for progress on gender equality ever since. The enthusiasm and commitment of the national delegates and representatives of civil society, who worked day and night on the text, helped to inspire the development within the European Union of a strong legislative base for gender equality and innovative policies for women's empowerment.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/20">Together, the Luxembourg and United Kingdom presidencies were determined to lead the EU to a strong reaffirmation of the declaration and platform for action to mark their tenth anniversary. This began with a conference and informal ministerial meeting in Luxembourg in February that reviewed progress in all EU member states towards the goals in the platform for action, and provided a comparative review of the institutional mechanisms for promoting gender equality within member states. The Luxembourg conference report provides an important basis for future comparative EU study, and the common ministerial declaration, adopted by Ministers of EU member states responsible for gender equality on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-04">4 February</phrase>, provides a strong statement of support for the Beijing platform for action.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/21">In March, the Luxembourg presidency led a very strong EU delegation to the 49th session of the Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations, where, in no small part due to the determination of the EU, we secured a full and universal reaffirmation of the Beijing declaration, with a renewed emphasis on the importance of gender equality for the achievement of the millennium development goals. These goals were reviewed at the millennium review summit in September, where the UK led the EU delegation.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/22">The outcome document of the summit makes even stronger linkages between the Beijing declaration and the MDGs, including a reference to making the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women, a central objective of relevant international policies as well as national development strategies, including those aimed at poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/23">Education and economic empowerment are key to promoting women's advancement in all the areas identified in the Beijing platform for action. An educated woman who has marketable skills and equal rights in the workplace can better resist discrimination in other arenas. Women, as 50 per cent of the EU population, offer great economic and social resources of creativity, entrepreneurship and community cohesion. But economic empowerment and gender equality require an effective legislative base and a wide range of policies, at national and local level and in business for success. Within the EU we now have a strong legislative base, with the conclusion of negotiations on the extension of protection against discrimination on the grounds of gender into the field of goods and services. Therefore at the UK presidency gender equality conference and ministerial meeting in Birmingham we concentrated on sharing our experience of practical interventions and policy initiatives that deliver economic empowerment for women and gender equality for women and men.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/24">Alongside practical examples from many EU member states, generously shared by representatives from governments, business, trade unions, academics and civil society, we also considered ideas that have been successful in the developing world. And Ministers, prior to their own very valuable discussions, visited community projects based in the West Midlands&mdash;several funded by the EU&mdash;to see how local initiatives can make a significant difference to the economic chances of disadvantaged women, particularly to those experiencing multiple discrimination. These projects working with the specific needs of minority ethnic women, women in business, training and education of women, young female entrepreneurs, women facing social exclusion and support for women in rural enterprise represent a microcosm of the complexity and diversity of issues faced by women in their everyday lives across Europe and highlight the challenges faced by policy- and decision-makers to achieving full gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/25">We were strongly influenced in our work by the mid-term review of the EU Lisbon strategy. That strategy recognises overtly that gender equality and the advancement of women are fundamental to the achievement of full employment, sustained economic growth and social cohesion, as well as the promotion of knowledge and innovation in Europe, the reinforcement of social protection and the eradication of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/26">We encourage all member states to ensure that their future annual Lisbon implementation reports, which will report on their national reform programmes for 2005&ndash;08, are fully mainstreamed&mdash;in particular that any targets and data are disaggregated by gender; that the goals of women's employment and the provision of good childcare are properly resourced and that the integrated guidelines on growth and jobs for 2005&ndash;08 are heeded, with particular reference to Guideline No. 18: promoting a lifecycle approach to work. The EU Lisbon strategy must be achieved by full acknowledgement of the importance of gender equality.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/27">The EU made a firm commitment, renewed in Luxembourg in February, to continue its work on different aspects of the Beijing platform for action by the development and collection of helpful and relevant indicators. It was also agreed that this year no new specific indicators would be developed, so that member states could focus on implementation of the platform in its entirety. In 2006 this work will recommence under the leadership of the Austrian and Finnish presidencies, including a focus on gender equality health indicators. However, in due course, that will be greatly assisted as a result of work done under Luxembourg and the UK this year on the establishment of the European Gender Institute. This and the recast directive that simplifies and streamlines the existing gender equality <i>acquis</i> have been the primary focus of our work in council.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.1/28">The presidency is proud of the EU's record of achievements in the field of gender equality but is all too well aware of the work that remains to be done. We believe that our emphasis at the presidency conference and ministerial meeting in Birmingham on women's economic empowerment in the context of the Beijing Declaration and the Lisbon strategy is important and has provided the opportunity for significant and purposeful conversations between practitioners from across the EU and more widely. We are pleased that the European Commission plans to reprise the theme of women's employment and work-life balance as the central part of its Third Annual Report to Heads of State and Government, to be presented at the spring council in March 2006. This UK presidency statement will be presented to the Employment, Health and Social Affairs Council for consideration on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>.</p>

	EU Presidency: General Affairs and External Relations Council
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-30b.24.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="24"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51130-29.htm#51130-29_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.24.1/1">The General Affairs and External Relations council (GAERC) was held on 21 to <phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw), the Defence Secretary (John Reid), and the International Development Secretary (Hilary Benn) chaired the council as presidency. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" name="Douglas Alexander">My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Douglas Alexander)</phrase> also represented the UK on certain agenda items.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/3">Defence Ministers</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/4" class="italic">Capabilities</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/5">The council approved the final Requirements Catalogue 05, which identifies the EU's military capability requirements and puts renewed emphasis on rapidly deployable, sustainable and interoperable armed forces. The catalogue was validated using computer-assisted operational analysis provided by NATO. Two further battlegroups were announced (Greece-Romania-Bulgaria-Cyprus and a Czech-Slovak group), which ensured the roster was filled to the end of 2008. Progress on capability development initiatives including battlegroups, the European Gendarmerie Force and the maritime dimension was welcomed. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/6" class="italic">Civil-military co-ordination</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/7">The work of the UK presidency in improving civil-military co-ordination, notably on comprehensive planning and security sector reform, was widely welcomed as a step towards bringing all the EU's instruments into a more effective holistic response. The Commission also supported this approach. Ministers agreed that this work should be applied to comprehensive reviews of the EU's engagement in Bosnia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and Aceh. The council also discussed the importance of EU support to building African peacekeeping capacity, and the EU's ability to respond rapidly to disasters.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/8" class="italic">European Defence Agency</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/9">The council welcomed the report by the head of the agency and agreed guidelines for the agency's work in 2006. Ministers exchanged views on the finalisation of administrative arrangements between the agency and Norway and Turkey. The presidency undertook to consult with those countries and return to the issue at the next opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/10" class="italic">Foreign and Defence Ministers: Bosnia</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/11">The council reviewed the EU military and police missions in Bosnia and agreed conclusions. It agreed that a continuing EU military presence was essential, with force levels broadly unchanged for the coming year. It established a follow-on police mission refocused to support police reform and the fight against organised crime, and agreed to strengthen the EU special representative's role in co-ordinating EU instruments. On the tenth anniversary of the initialling of the Dayton agreement, Ministers welcomed the progress made by Bosnia and authorised the Commission to open negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/12">Foreign Ministers</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/13" class="italic">Preparation for the 15-<phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase> European Council</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/15" class="italic">Financial Perspectives 2007&ndash;2013</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/16">The presidency introduced this item and highlighted that it remained committed to reaching a deal in December. The presidency highlighted the need to make progress in three main areas: (i) the structure of EU spending; (ii) modernising the budget, including a timetable for review; and (iii) resources. Significant changes would be needed to the proposals made in June by the Luxembourg presidency. The presidency highlighted plans for a Ministerial conclave on <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>, ahead of which the presidency would table comprehensive proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/17" class="italic">WTO</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/18">The Commission set out the latest developments in the Doha round. On process, the Commission commented that they will continue to ensure transparency with member states and would consult the council fully at Hong Kong. Short conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/19" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/20">The presidency and High Representative Solana welcomed the agreement on the EU mission to monitor the Palestinian operation of the Rafah crossing point on the Gaza-Egypt border. The parties' acceptance of an international role was significant. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner highlighted that Commission capacity-building programmes would work hand-in-glove with the ESDP monitors. In preparation for the <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January</phrase> Palestine Legislative Council (PLC) elections, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said an election observation mission would deploy in mid-December and would consist of 172 observers. Monitors would strictly limit their contacts to issues related to the observation of the elections. The presidency underlined the importance of the EU maintaining its position that observers should not enter into dialogue with Hamas until they renounced violence and recognised Israel. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/21" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/22">The Foreign Secretary briefed on his recent visit to Iraq (10 to <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase>), highlighting that steady progress was being made. The Foreign Secretary emphasised the importance of the December elections, at which the Iraqis were keen for international observers. The council agreed that mounting a full EU election observation mission (EOM) would not be possible in the time available, but would explore what additional assistance it could provide in support of the <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase> elections. The council also agreed that the EU should be considering now how to prepare for closer relations with the new government next year. The presidency thanked the Commission for its work on the opening of a Commission Delegation in Baghdad. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said it was currently looking for a head of mission and, in addition, would shortly be submitting a draft negotiating mandate to member states for a trade and co-operation agreement with Iraq by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/23" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/24">The presidency updated the council on the <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase> International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report. High Representative Solana highlighted the need to work closely with Mr El-Baradei and for the international community to stay firm and united. The presidency agreed that the issue remained difficult but it was important the European side actively supported a diplomatic solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/25" class="italic">Migration in External Relations</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/26">The council agreed council conclusions on migration in external relations and underlined their significance. The presidency noted the close interest taken by heads of government at Hampton Court on this issue. The Commission stressed the importance of better co-coordination of work between justice and home affairs, external relations and development and of increasing partnership with countries of origin and transit on migration issues. They particularly highlighted the need to improve engagement with sub-Saharan countries and to reinforce dialogue with neighbouring countries. The Commission also hoped that the reform of the financial instruments would enable it to respond more quickly and effectively to urgent migration-related situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/27" class="italic">EU Strategy for Africa</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/28">The council agreed conclusions on the Commission communication on the <i>EU-Africa Strategy: Towards a Euro-African Pact to Accelerate Africa's Development</i>. The communication will form an integral part of the overall EU strategy for Africa, which should be discussed and agreed by Foreign Ministers at the December GAERC and endorsed at the December European Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/29">During separate exchanges of views in preparation for the EU-Africa strategy, Foreign and Development Ministers identified the following priorities for the strategy: African ownership; mechanisms to monitor implementation of the strategy; increasing support for peace and security, including through a long-term commitment to the EU's African peace facility; good governance; trade and regional integration; establishing an EU-Africa infrastructure facility; meeting aid volume commitments and providing more assistance for health, education and the fight against AIDS; migration; environment; human rights; and economic partnership agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/30" class="italic">AOB&mdash;ASEM/Burma</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/31">The presidency highlighted the issue of Burmese participation at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) meetings and agreed that officials should take work forward and revert in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/32" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Cyprus</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/34" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Bulgarian Medics</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/35">At the request of Bulgaria, who highlighted that the Libyan court of appeal was allowing a new hearing on the case of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff at the end of January. This might herald a positive evolution. The Bulgaria Foreign Minister thanked the presidency, the Commission and the member states for their efforts. The presidency offered continuing support to resolve this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/36" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Organisation for European Cooperation and Development (OECD) Secretary General</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/44">The council and Commission agreed &quot;The European Consensus on Development&quot;. This will be a joint declaration between the council, European Commission and European Parliament. It is divided into two parts: the first sets out common objectives and principles to guide the EU and its twenty-five member states in development, focused on poverty eradication and partner country ownership; and the second sets out the revised EC development policy which clarifies the Community's role and added value and ensures that priority attention be given to least developed and low income countries in resource allocation; and development shall be taken into account in other policies that affect developing countries. The European Parliament is expected to formally adopt the declaration in December.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/45" class="italic">Orientation Debate: Effectiveness of EU External Assistance</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/46">The council held its sixth annual &quot;Orientation Debate&quot; on improving the effectiveness of EU external action based on a presidency discussion paper. The council adopted conclusions which highlight the significant progress made by the Commission over the past five years and the concrete measures needed over the next year to improve the quality of aid and aid delivery at EU and Community levels, including: more joint multi-annual programming; lead donor arrangements at field-level; and more predictable long-term funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/47" class="italic">Post-Tsunami Follow-up</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/50">The council discussed the package of aid for trade measures proposed by the presidency, for agreement ahead of the WTO ministerial in Hong Kong on 13 to <phrase class="date" code="">18 December</phrase>. The council welcomed the Commission's commitment at the G8 summit in Gleneagles to increase aid for trade to &euro;1 billion annually and agreed to aim to adopt conclusions at the <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase> GAERC, which express its collective intention to increase aid for trade within rising aid volumes.</p>

	EU Presidency: Justice and Home Affairs Council
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-30b.28.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="28"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51130-30.htm#51130-30_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.28.1/1">The Justice and Home Affairs Council will be held on 1 to <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will be chairing the majority of the meeting and my noble and learned friend the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor will be chairing the items on civil justice. I will also be representing the presidency.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/2">One of the key issues for this council will be counter-terrorism and the council will be asked to recognise the significant progress which has been made during the UK presidency. This will include approving the EU strategy on counter-terrorism, which is designed to complement the counter-terrorism action plan by providing a longer-term strategic direction. I am also hopeful that the council will be able to agree the draft strategy and action plan on radicalisation and recruitment, looking at the contributing factors involved and how they can be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/3">Following on from the discussions by heads of state at Hampton Court, there will be a strategic discussion at council of the Commission's contribution to the European Council paper on a global approach to migration.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/4">The Government have emphasised throughout the presidency the importance that we have attached to the external dimension of justice and home affairs issues. To reflect this, I hope to achieve agreement to the draft strategy on external relations at the council. Linked to this, and following on from the useful discussions at the informal JHA Council I hosted in Newcastle, I hope that the council will be able to agree draft council conclusions on increased EU assistance to combating drugs in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/5">Another key priority for the UK presidency has been to raise the profile of EU work to tackle human trafficking. This is expected to result in the agreement to a wide-ranging EU action plan at the council, which I very much welcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/6">On the Framework Decision on Simplifying the Exchange of Information and Intelligence Between Law Enforcement Authorities, the European Council's call for political agreement was reinforced at the July council following the terrorist attacks on London. I hope that the council will be able to agree to a general approach on this measure, though this will pertain solely to the text of the draft instrument and not to its annexes, allowing further time for consideration and fine-tuning of the detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/7">Retention of telecommunications data is a complex dossier that has been subject to intense negotiation. Reaching a first reading deal with the European Parliament before the end of 2005 remains an ambitious but achievable goal. Subject to further progress in negotiations with the European Parliament and at ambassador level this week there remains a good chance that the council could reach political agreement on draft directive text. In that case I am hopeful that a First Reading agreement could be reached with the European Parliament during our presidency.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/8">The European evidence warrant will provide a fast and effective way of obtaining evidence from another member state based on the principle of mutual recognition. There still remain issues to be resolved at the council, notably around the grounds for refusal contained in Article 15, but I hope to be able to deliver a compromise that all member states can accept so that we can reach a general approach on this important dossier.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/9">In the area of civil justice, three items of business will be discussed: the European order for payment, small claims and the directive on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters. This reflects the priority which we as a presidency have given civil justice. Our citizens live increasingly cross-border lives: they live, work, buy and sell across Europe's borders. EU co-operation in civil judicial matters can bring practical benefits to the lives of citizens across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/10">At the council, I hope that we can reach a general approach on the European order for payment. On the European small claims regulation, I hope to confirm the emerging consensus on the key principles of an effective European small claims procedure. Our aim is to achieve an accelerated and simplified procedure, as contemplated in the Tampere conclusions and re-stated in the Hague programme, based on the principle of proportionality. Lastly we intend to use the council to reach a broad agreement on the text of the draft directive on mediation, subject to outstanding questions of scope and subsidiarity and pending the opinion of the European Parliament. Progress in these areas will provide citizens and businesses with a means to resolve disputes more efficiently and at less cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/11">There will also be a state of play report on the Framework Decision on Certain Procedural Rights in Criminal Proceedings, which will set out the progress that has been made on this dossier and the areas of contention that still remain to be taken forward under the Austrian presidency.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/12">In the margins of the council, the Mixed Committee will also meet with the Icelandic Minister in the chair. There will be a further brief discussion of the draft Framework Decision on Simplifying the Exchange of Information in this forum. There is also going to be a report on progress on the technical developments for the Schengen Information System II, to look at whether more needs to be done to help meet the 2007 timetable. Finally, I am expecting the Commission to make a presentation on its Communication on Enhanced Interaction Between the Visa Information System, Schengen Information System II and Eurodac.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.1/13">Finally, in the margins of the council, representatives of the member states, meeting inter-governmentally, will be looking to agree draft conclusions on common minimum security standards for ID cards. This will be important in addressing the weak link in EU travel documentation.</p>

	<p pid="b.31.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/2">The Government are today publishing a consultation paper on proposals for additional powers and responsibilities for the Greater London Authority (GLA)&mdash;the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/3">We believe the time is now right to look at giving the Mayor a greater say in the planning and delivery of London's strategic services while preserving the appropriate balance of power between the Mayor; Assembly and the boroughs. We are opening the door to significant decentralisation of powers from Whitehall, while ensuring the GLA remains a focused and strategic authority. We believe the GLA has proven its worth, and that the time is right to shift power from Whitehall to London. How far will depend on the response to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/4">The Government's consultation paper outlines a number of proposals for additional powers for the Mayor across a range of policy areas, including housing, learning and skills, planning and waste management and waste planning. It also explores options for additional powers for the London Assembly and changes in appointments to the boards of the four functional bodies in the GLA group.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/5">We look forward to hearing the views of Londoners and those with an interest in London during the consultation period, which will run until <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase>. After considering all the responses to this consultation exercise, the Government will announce a final package of proposals in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/6">A copy of the consultation paper has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.31.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Liam Byrne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/2">Today I am publishing <i>Valuing People: Making things better</i> the Government's third annual report on learning disability services. The report describes progress made in implementing the programme of action set out in the White Paper <i>Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century</i> (Cm 5086) and comments on the National Director for Learning Disabilities' report <i>The Story So Far&mdash;A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century</i> which was published in March this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/3"><i>Valuing People</i> is a cross-government strategy. In last year's annual report, <i>Valuing People: Moving Forward Together</i>, we described areas where government departments worked with learning disabled people to ensure that they could be more fully included in society. It recorded a wide range of activity covering many aspects of daily life. In this year's annual report, <i>Valuing People: Making things better</i>, we have described:</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/4" class="indent">the work of the Learning Disability Task Force&mdash;which has changed the way it works in order to focus on the things that are really important for people with a learning disability;</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/5" class="indent">policies set up by the Department for Education and Skills such as <i>Every Child Matters</i>, the early support programme and removing barriers to achievement to look at how children with learning disabilities and their families can have services that meet their specific needs. Through encouraging more joined-up working, DfES has also been addressing the issues faced by young people during the transition period when leaving school and becoming an adult;</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/6" class="indent">issues around choice and control for people with learning disabilities and how individual budgets can help increase people's choices. In the Department of Health, the Valuing People Support Team's &quot;In Control&quot; project has been testing out how to make individual budgets happen for certain groups of people and we aim to learn from this; and</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/7" class="indent">the work being done to make people with learning disabilities' day to day lives better: such as improving transport services and, under new laws such as the Disability Discrimination Act, helping make information about transport easier to understand.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/8">Today's report, like last year's, is written in an accessible form, using pictures and straightforward, jargon-free language. It is important that people with learning disabilities can see for themselves what is being done to improve the services they use and to increase the opportunities available to them to lead the type of life the rest of us take for granted.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/9"><i>Valuing People</i> said that it would take a minimum of five years for its programme to be implemented. We are now over halfway through that period and continue to make good progress. However, section three of today's report outlines where the Government acknowledge changes that still need to be made. We shall be working to address these issues in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.3/10">Copies of <i>Valuing People: Government Annual Report on Learning Disabilities 2005</i>&mdash;&quot;<i>Making Things Better</i>&quot; have been placed in the Library.</p>

	Railways: Integrated Kent Franchise

	<p pid="b.32.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Alistair Darling) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/2">I am announcing today that Govia has been awarded the contract to run the Integrated Kent rail franchise from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/3">The contract my department has signed commits Govia to introducing the high speed, commuter trains that will use the Channel Tunnel rail link to serve the south-east from 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/4">Journey times for passengers who wish to travel from Ramsgate and east Kent, through the Medway towns and Thames Gateway to the centre of London will be reduced. It will be the first high-speed commuter service this country has seen. In 2012 Govia will provide the flagship &quot;Olympic Javelin&quot; rail service that helped London secure the Olympic Games. This will link St Pancras and Stratford in less than eight minutes.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/5">In addition, Govia has committed to improve performance, invest around &pound;76 million in passenger and staff facilities, oversee the construction of two depots in east Kent to maintain the new and existing fleet of trains and add a number of off-peak services to the current timetable. The franchise contract is for eight years with the final two years dependent on service performance achieving preset targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/6">There has been significant investment in the franchise region in recent years. The taxpayer has invested more than &pound;600 million in new rolling stock in Kent in the past three years. In addition, Kent has seen &pound;93 million of investment in power supply, stations, depots and related infrastructure; &pound;250 million will be invested on the new high-speed trains.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/7">The total subsidy for IKF is &pound;585 million over the eight years. It is therefore justifiable for the new operator to increase fares by 3 per cent above inflation from January 2007 for five years to ensure there is fair balance between the taxpayer and fare-paying passenger.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/8">I am satisfied that the competition for the franchise has resulted in a contract that represents very good value for the taxpayer. It is a tough contract that Govia will be expected to deliver on. It will help support the new housing and economic opportunities in the Thames Gateway area and the region beyond.</p>
