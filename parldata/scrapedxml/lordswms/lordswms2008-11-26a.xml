	Broadcasting: Digital Switchover
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-11-26a.151.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100982" speakername="Lord Carter of Barnes" colon=":" colnum="151"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81126-wms0001.htm#81126-wms0001.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.151.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/2">In June 2007, my right honourable friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1555" name="Tessa Jowell">the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell)</phrase> announced that the Government proposed to ask the BBC to make up to &pound;14 million of licence fee funding available to assist Channel 4 with the capital costs of digital switchover. The announcement made it clear that the assistance was subject to state aid approval from the European Commission and a formal notification seeking that approval was submitted to the Commission in October 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/3">In March this year, the Commission opened a formal investigation procedure in respect of the notification. The Government submitted a response to the Commission, as did two interested third parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/4">In the period since the notification was made, the debate on the future of public service broadcasting in the UK has moved on significantly. Furthermore, the structural challenges that traditional commercially funded public service broadcasters face have been exacerbated by current cyclical conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/5">The Government have therefore brought forward its timeline for decisions and are now committed to take a more comprehensive view on the future institutional and financial framework of public service broadcasting, including the future of Channel 4, early in 2009 within the framework of the Digital Britain project. The Digital Britain project was launched in October to look at innovation, investment and quality in the digital and communications sectors. The Digital Britain report will be a comprehensive analysis of the United Kingdom's digital economy and will bring forward proposals to support the development of these sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/6">The emerging proposals are likely to be more wide-ranging than a proposition relating specifically to Channel 4's switchover costs. The Government will of course ensure that any new proposals for potential state aid arising from this wider consideration process are properly notified to the Commission in advance of implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/7">Against this background, the Government have decided against proceeding with the notified proposals to provide assistance for Channel 4 in respect of its switchover costs. The Government has accordingly informed the Commission that it wishes to withdraw the current state aid notification.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Geoff Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/2">Sir Joseph Pilling's report of his independent strategic review of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was published by the then Secretary of State, my right honourable friend the Member for Bolton West, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-17">17 July</phrase>. My right honourable friend accepted Sir Joseph's recommendations in relation to the CAA's corporate governance and promised a further Statement in the autumn. I should like to add my thanks to Sir Joseph for his important contribution to ensuring that the CAA will be as effective a regulator in the future as it has been in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/3">I accept that the CAA's current status as a public corporation should be retained. As Sir Joseph recommended, the department will work with the CAA to develop amendments to bring the legislative framework up to date, addressing specific issues identified in the report. As Sir Joseph noted, some of his recommendations were relevant to the separate review of airport economic regulation that my predecessor announced in April and to improving the passenger experience, such as his recommendation for a statutory air transport users council (AUC). He was also right to ask us to consider whether the UK's aviation regulator should have a general environmental duty and in what context. We are looking sympathetically at these connected issues, which would require legislation and prior consultation, and will make a further announcement in the early part of next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/4">Otherwise, I am pleased to be able to announce that I have accepted in broad principle Sir Joseph's recommendations, as has the CAA board. Implementation of the report's many recommendations, and corresponding revisions to the sponsorship statement that defines our relationship, are in hand with two exceptions. We are deferring a decision on changing the route of appeal for fitness-of-character decisions until the general regulatory chamber and the supporting first-tier tribunals are fully established. Also, in the financial downturn that has developed since Sir Joseph Pilling reported, I have agreed with the CAA that it is not a priority to recruit additional international staff or rent separate premises for the AUC, although the CAA will endeavour to meet the principle of these recommendations in other ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/5">I am also pleased to say that the process of governance change has begun. We are currently seeking a new part-time non-executive chair for the CAA and this will be followed by the recruitment of a chief executive for the CAA, on the basis envisaged by Sir Joseph Pilling.</p>

This will improve services for families at risk to help prevent children and young people offending and experiencing other poor outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Jonathan Shaw) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-03">3 March</phrase>, the Government published the five-year cross-government independent living strategy. The strategy sets out a series of government commitments aimed at ensuring that disabled people have choice and control over the support that they need to live their everyday lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/3">The strategy was produced in partnership with disabled people and we need to ensure that disabled people are actively involved in making the strategy a reality and checking that good progress is being made. Consequently, the launch of the strategy saw the start of a consultation to seek views on how best to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/4">The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-20">20 June</phrase> and I am pleased to announce that I am today placing copies of the Government's response to this consultation in both House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/5">Following the consultation and the further involvement of disabled people in the development of the Government's response, the Government have decided to implement the following steps to make sure that disabled people are actively involved in the implementation and monitoring of the strategy:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/6">establish an independent living scrutiny group to review progress on implementing the strategy;develop a web-based and print resource to support disabled people's involvement in local strategic partnership boards;work with Equality 2025 to look at how best to use and develop existing networks to form a &quot;network of networks&quot;, creating a two-way channel for communication between government and disabled people;examine some of the options&mdash;for example, specific courses&mdash;suggested by respondents for building leadership capacity; andwork to help disabled people's organisations to benefit more from new opportunities to build capacity in the third sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/7">The Government's response will be available on the Office for Disability Issues website later today (<a href="http://www.odi.gov.uk/working/independentlivingstrategy.asp">http://www.odi.gov.uk/working/independentlivingstrategy.asp</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.154.1/2">I have today published a consultation paper seeking views on a proposal to introduce a new practical motorcycling test and associated fees. It is proposed to split the practical motorcycling test into two modules&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.154.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.3/2">I should like to update the House on the figures that have previously been quoted in regard to the delivery of education maintenance allowances (EMA).</p>
	<p pid="a.154.3/3">In my Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-19">19 November</phrase> about delivery of learner support schemes, I indicated that, as of the day before, there were 12,016 applications for EMA in the process of being finalised. This information was drawn from statistics provided to the LSC by Liberata.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.3/4">Since then, in response to emerging concerns about the methodology being used by Liberata to calculate the work-in-progress statistics and to ensure that the figures were accurate in advance of the transfer of the contract to Capita, the LSC commissioned a full count of the outstanding applications. This analysis was made possible by the relatively small number of applications still remaining.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.3/5">Liberata's physical count on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-21">21 November</phrase> recorded that there were around 26,000 applications in the process of being finalised. The LSC advises me that the new figure represents a more accurate reflection of the outstanding number of applications. However, once the contract has transferred, Capita will review these figures in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.3/6">Clearly this is unsatisfactory. I have therefore today written to Mark Haysom, chief executive of the LSC, asking for a full explanation as to why the issue with the methodology for calculating the statistics had not been revealed sooner.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.3/7">I have written to the chairman of the Children, Schools and Families Select Committee to update him on this matter. I am placing a copy of this letter in the House Library along with a copy of my letter to Mark Haysom.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (Michael Wills) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/2">The Government are today publishing a consultation paper which seeks views on whether candidates' addresses should continue to be disclosed automatically during UK parliamentary elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/3">The proposal has been made following the removal of MPs and Peers from certain provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. It is argued that such public figures and their families face more than ordinary risks to their safety, security and peace of mind, and that special considerations therefore apply to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/4">Others argue that the electoral process should be open and transparent, and that those putting themselves forward for public office in this way should be prepared to face those risks in the interests of accountability and the free expression of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/5">This paper seeks to examine those arguments in more depth, as well as the practical issues which may arise from any proposed change and the implications for the electorate, for the electoral process, for candidates, and for administrators.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/6">The Government have an open mind on this issue and the purpose of this consultation is to seek views on the proposal that the full home addresses of candidates should no longer appear on ballot papers, nomination papers and other electoral documents open to public inspection at UK parliamentary elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/7">Copies of the consultation paper will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies will also be available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.3/2">I am pleased to outline the agenda items for the forthcoming Energy Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-08">8 December</phrase> where I plan to represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/3">The first item on the agenda is the EU climate and energy package (a directive on the improvement and extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme; a directive covering greenhouse gas emissions from sectors not covered by the EU ETS; a directive on regulatory storage of carbon dioxide; and a directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources).

	<p pid="a.156.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Sadiq Khan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/2">I wish to inform the House about the progress of the FiReControl project, which will establish a linked network of highly resilient fire control rooms across England to replace the current stand-alone facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/3">Major emergencies in recent years have shown us the very real challenges we face in today's world. The fire and rescue service is central to our ability to be able to respond to these and the Government are determined to support it by investing around &pound;1 billion to ensure that it has the necessary capabilities and resilience. The FiReControl project is an important part of this investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/4">FiReControl will give all fire and rescue services access to systems and technology that only a few currently benefit from. It will result in greater resilience and collaboration, better information and incident support for firefighters, and a better service to the public&mdash;both day to day and during major incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/5">The Government are investing &pound;380 million in FiReControl and remain strongly committed to it. Good progress has been made on a number of fronts, including the completion of eight new highly resilient regional control centre buildings, the establishment of eight local authority-controlled companies, which bring together all relevant local partners, and the development of a strong network of regional project teams working to ensure that the project is a success in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/6">However, FiReControl is a complex and demanding project and as such is subject to rigorous ongoing review. Since I took up my post as Fire Minister, a thorough review of all aspects of the FiReControl project has been completed and a number of difficulties with the ICT and other dimensions of the project were identified. These issues will result in some delay and the FRS rightly expects us to address these in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/7">As a result, I can announce today that the project is now aiming to achieve cut-over to the first three regional control centres in the north-east, east Midlands and south-west in summer 2010, nine months later than previously expected, with the full system expected to be in place by spring 2012, five months later than originally planned. I want to emphasise, however, that, as with any project of this nature, we will have certainty about the timing of these later stages of the project only once earlier stages have been completed successfully.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/8">Our updated plans are being delivered in close partnership with the fire and rescue service, fire and rescue authorities and our suppliers, EADS Defence and Security Systems Ltd. Shorter-term milestones will be monitored very carefully and progress shared with our partners. Longer-term milestones will be reviewed as the project progresses. Members of the fire and rescue service are being given more opportunities to contribute to the development of the project so that they can have full confidence in the new systems being developed, with staff embedded in national and local project teams and playing a full part in joint working groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/9">I am also committed to ensuring transparency around the project wherever practical. So I am today publishing Part 2 of the <I>FiReControl Business Case</I> and seeking views during a period of consultation. Part 1 of the business case was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-08">8 July 2008</phrase> and was placed in the Library of the House. Part 2 will be placed in the Library of the House later today.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.1/2">The Government are today announcing that the Supporting People programme funding of &pound;1.66 billion will be paid as a named unring-fenced grant to administering authorities for 2009-10 and will be included in area-based grant from 2010-11. This is the largest single grant to authorities to help millions of people live independently in their homes and this means that authorities will have the flexibility to spend this money as they see fit to help some of the most vulnerable people in their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.1/3">This year government has been working with 15 administering authorities, providers, service users, and stakeholders to gather views and evidence about the potential impact of removing the ring-fence for Supporting People. During this period, there have not been any serious concerns raised and the feedback from the 15 administering authorities has shown that the kinds of innovation they are delivering has been positive and is enabling the delivery of jointly commissioned services which provide better outcomes for service users.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.1/4">The transition to a non-ring-fenced funding stream needs to be managed carefully and government will continue to work with the sector and build on the success of the programme. Today the Government are also announcing a number of measures to support the transition of delivery through an unring-fenced grant which will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.157.1/5">a commitment to deliver a new financial modelling tool which will provide evidence at a local level on the financial benefits of investment in housing support in terms of crisis prevention and the reduced need for more intensive and costly interventions, leading to better outcomes for the citizen and savings to the public purse. The department will be seeking tenders for this work before Christmas;the announcement of two national conferences jointly hosted by CLG, the DH, the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services in January 2009 to help authorities and their commissioning partners learn from the pathfinder project and consider how their own localities will respond to the changing agenda;a commitment that CLG will continue to work with member groups in the sector to support providers in responding to the new commissioning and procurement environment. This will include 18 regional round-table events in early 2009 to bring commissioners and providers together to discuss planning for the future; Communities and Local Government is committed to working with the Office of Third Sector on promoting better commissioning practice, with a special focus on small third-sector groups;the publication today of guidance on understanding regional need for housing-related support. Copies will be placed in the Library of the House; andongoing support from the Communities and Local Government regional resource teams to support local performance improvement on the commissioning and delivery of services (taking into account the work being undertaken by government offices and the regional improvement and efficiency partnerships).</p>

	Local Government: Unitary Councils
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-11-26a.158.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="158"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81126-wms0002.htm#81126-wms0002.htm_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.158.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/2">Earlier this year, Parliament debated and approved structural change orders to create from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> nine new unitary councils: Bedford Borough Council, Cheshire East Council, Cheshire West and Chester Council, Central Bedfordshire Council, Cornwall Council, County Durham Council, Northumberland Council, Shropshire Council and Wiltshire Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/3">We are working closely with those responsible locally for implementing these new unitary councils to complete the legislative framework needed to support the transition to these new councils. We have already made and laid before Parliament staffing regulations (June 2008), transfer of functions regulations (August 2008) and two sets of transitional regulations (August and November 2008).</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/4">Today, I have laid before the House the Local Government (Structural Changes) (Finance) Regulations 2008, which represent a further significant milestone towards the completion of the legislative framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/5">These regulations, made under Part 1 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, make transitional, supplementary and consequential provision in relation to finance, including in particular the following matters:</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/6">the setting and approval of budgets and the process of billing for council tax and non-domestic rates for each unitary council's first financial year;enabling the equalisation of council tax in restructuring areas to occur over a period of more than one year but at the latest in the financial year after the fifth anniversary of the reorganisation to provide where necessary for a more equitable process of equalisation. If these transitional provisions are not used, council tax equalisation will occur in the first financial year;providing that existing local rating lists and valuation lists for a reorganising area will be the lists of the new councils on and after the reorganisation date, and providing for the amalgamation of these lists into a single document at any time after the reorganisation date; andensuring that after a reorganisation, the new unitary council has continuity and responsibility for finance functions relating to earlier financial years.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/7">I am confident that these regulations will ensure that the new unitary councils will have the powers that they need to set their budget and council tax for 2009-10 and to bill and collect both their council tax and non-domestic rates for that year. They will also ensure that the new councils are able to fulfil their responsibilities, including enforcement activity, relating to earlier financial years.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/8">No one underestimates the scale of the task that those leading the changes in these areas face over the coming months. A key measure of success for the new unitary councils will be that, from the outset, their council tax is affordable and that they adopt a budget that both reflects the savings proposed in their original unitary bid and delivers efficient and quality local services. The framework that the regulations put in place will enable them to do this.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (David Hanson) made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/2">The Government are committed to ensuring that taxpayers receive the best possible value for money from the record investment made in probation in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/3">I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-09">9 April 2008</phrase> the consultation on a best-value regime for probation services and I am pleased to announce to the House the outcome of that consultation. I propose, following the consultation, to introduce a new best-value framework as signalled during the passage of the Offender Management Bill last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/4">The National Offender Management Service Agency will require local probation boards and trusts to undertake a rolling programme of best-value reviews. The proposed framework will apply to probation boards and trusts with the exception of areas reserved to probation trusts in the Offender Management Act 2007. It will enable boards and trusts to demonstrate, in a transparent way, the value for money of their services and to drive improvements in the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of their service delivery. Having considered the options, I have decided that best value will proceed on the basis of benchmarking of selected areas of work, assessment of probation performance against that benchmark and greater competition for all sectors for those who do not meet the required standard through improvements to existing services.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/5">I intend to announce shortly the first areas of work for which best value will apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/6">The Government are currently developing a regulatory framework to ensure that competition is conducted in a fair and transparent way, allowing all sectors to compete. Discussions are currently ongoing with interested parties and will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/7">The measures ensure greater value for money and more effective services to punish and reform offenders and to deliver better outcomes for victims and the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/8">I am grateful for the response to the consultation from a wide range of interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/9">Copies of the best-value consultation response document will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies will also be available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office and on the internet at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/cp0608.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/cp0608.htm</a>.</p>

	Pensions
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-11-26a.160.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="160"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81126-wms0002.htm#81126-wms0002.htm_spmin6">
	<p pid="a.160.1/1">During the passage of the Pensions Bill through both Houses, there has been much debate on the Government's view on responsible investment and disinvestment by pension schemes. This is clearly an issue of some importance, particularly to trustees, and is one that is continually developing as the body of case law on responsible investment evolves.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.1/2">It would be inappropriate for the Government to comment on the future development of the existing principles contained in case law, as the interpretation of case law is of course a matter for the courts and not for Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.1/3">However, I would like to put on record the Government's view of the law. There is no reason in law why, in making investment decisions, trustees cannot consider social, ethical and environmental considerations, including sustainability, in addition to their usual criteria of financial returns, security and diversification.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.1/4">It follows from this that it may be appropriate for trustees to engage in these considerations with companies in which they invest. This may include disinvesting from such companies if, acting in accordance with their fiduciary duties and the objects of their trust, they consider that this is right and in the best interests of their members.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Policing, Crime and Security (Vernon Coaker) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/2">I have today placed in the Library our proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales for 2009-10, with indicative allocations for 2010-11. I intend to implement the proposals on police grant subject to consideration of any representations and to the approval of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/3">The Government announced last year provisional funding totals for the three-year period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Three-year settlements were widely welcomed by police authorities, enabling them to develop medium-term financial strategies and to control their spending. The recent multiyear pay deal for the police will help to improve further still their medium-term planning. We intend to implement the settlement for 2009-10 broadly unchanged from last year's announcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/4">The funding settlement for next year is built on considerable investment in the police service since 1997-98. On a like-for-like basis, government grant for the police will have increased by over 60 per cent or over &pound;3.7 billion between 1997-98 and 2010-11. This has helped to expand local policing considerably. Police officer numbers at the end of March this year remain historically high at 140,230 (14,405 more than in 1997). The police workforce overall, including officers, support staff and community support officers, has increased by 27.5 per cent (50,246) since 1997 to 233,263 in March 2008, a record number. The workforce increased by 3,166 (1.4 per cent) between March 2007 and March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/5">The police reform programme continues. The policing Green Paper <I>From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing our Communities Together</I> was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-17">17 July</phrase>. It set out the Government's vision for the future of policing and put forward proposals to empower citizens, professionalise and free the police from unnecessary bureaucracy and sharpen the strategic role of government. Over 300 formal responses to consultation were received. Home Office Ministers and officials have met over 1,000 people to share views and prompt debate. We are considering the many views that were put forward and will produce a public response to the consultation shortlysetting out the Government's position and plans for implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/6">We have made good progress to date in implementing Sir Ronnie Flanagan's recommendations on reducing bureaucracy. We are also developing the new, single national target on confidence. This target is to increase public confidence that agencies are tackling local crime and anti-social behaviour priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/7">Neighbourhood policing is continuing to transform police forces' relationships with their communities through closer engagement with local people, joint problem solving and working together to make changes for the longer term to make communities safer. Every community in England and Wales now has a dedicated neighbourhood policing team aiming to identify and tackle the key policing priorities identified by local people. The next phase of neighbourhood policing will concentrate on integrating with other local authority services at a neighbourhood level. Neighbourhood crime and justice co-ordinators will help to ensure that this is delivered faster and further. This next phase will also build on good practice to deliver a national pledge that guarantees the public key service standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/8">The Home Office also contributes &pound;76 million to the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund and the Young Persons Substance Misuse Partnership Grant delivered by local government. In addition, the capital element of the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund remains at &pound;18 million. This funding will help local areas to deliver national and local improvement priorities such as those set out in local area agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/9"><I>The police grant settlement 2009-10</I></p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/10">Total provision for policing revenue grants in 2009-10 will be &pound;9,482 million, an overall increase of 2.8 per cent. I propose to distribute the settlement as set out below.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.3/25" class="indent">* This figure includes the formula grant allocations in Table 2 plus former specific grants (&pound;208 million) that are now added to general grant but are not distributed according to the formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/26" class="indent">** Indicative figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/27">Police funding proposals within the local government finance system for England are being announced by my right honourable friend the Member for Wentworth today and those for Wales by the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/28">Provisional general policing grants (ie Home Office police grant, revenue support grant and national non-domestic rates) for English and Welsh police authorities in 2009-10 are set out at Table 2. Indicative figures for 2010-11 are given in Table 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/29"><I>General grant</I></p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/30">Within the general grant provision of 2.7 per cent, the funding floor was set at 2.5 per cent for each of the CSR years. Each police authority in England and Wales is guaranteed an increase of at least this level. The grant floor provides for stability but at the same time a degree of grant scaling has enabled us to target resources to areas with greater relative need. Our promised review of the funding formula before the next CSR is already under way with active collaboration from the police community.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/31">The Government are clear that there is no excuse for excessive increases in precepts on council tax next year. We will not hesitate to use capping powers to deal with excessive council tax increases in 2009-10, including requiring authorities to rebill if necessary. We took capping action against seven police authorities in 2008-09. This included designating Cheshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire police authorities for capping in advance for 2009-10. My right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government is announcing today that action is being taken forward to limit these authorities' precept increases to around 3 per cent in 2009-10. The three authorities have 21 days in which to challenge our decision. Any challenges will be carefully considered before final decisions are taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/32"><I>Welsh police authorities</I></p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/33">I have again ensured that Welsh police authorities are treated in line with English police authorities. I have provided additional support of &pound;15.5 million in 2009-10 to ensure that Dyfed-Powys, Gwent and North Wales police authorities receive at least a minimum grant increase of 2.5 per cent. Floor funding is also partly funded by reducing police grant to South Wales Police Authority, so that it too will receive the level of grant that it would if it were in England.<I></I></p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/34">There are some small changes between funding for the four Welsh police authorities due to corrected data from the Welsh Assembly Government on the number of band D properties in Wales. This correction has no effect on the amount or distribution of funds for English police authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/35"><I>Specific grants for police authorities</I></p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/36">Police authorities will continue to receive specific grants for particular schemes. Details are set out in Table 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/37">Counterterrorism funding&mdash;We will continue to invest in counterterrorism policing. As announced last year, funding for police counterterrorism will be increased from &pound;524 million in 2008-09 to &pound;552 million n 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/38">Crime fighting fund&mdash;&pound;277 million will again be made available to forces in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/39">Neighbourhood policing&mdash;We will maintain the ring fence on this funding for at least the next two years to ensure that it is properly embedded. Funding will increase by an average of 2.7 per cent in each year. A total of &pound;332 million will be made available in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/40">Basic command unit fund&mdash;This will run for one final year at the same level as in 2008-09, &pound;40 million, while plans are developed for a new community safety fund to be created from the resources in the existing BCU fund from April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/41"><I>Funding additional to the settlement</I></p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/42">Protective services&mdash;We made available an additional &pound;35 million from 2008-09 to 2010-11 to support tackling serious organised crime and other protective services; &pound;11 million a year was provided in the first two years, rising to &pound;13 million in 2010-11, to ensure that all forces meet the national standards for capability and capacity in protective services by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/43">Guns, gangs and knives&mdash;In 2008-09, &pound;6.8 million was made available to the 10 police forces in the tackling knives action programme to enable them and their partners to undertake additional activity to tackle knife crime and gang-related violence. For 2009-10, we will consider making additional specific grant available to areas where knife and gun crime is particularly prevalent or there are significant concerns over gang-related activity. This will enable the police and their partners to bear down on serious violence in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/44">The Safer and Stronger Communities Fund&mdash;Resource element of &pound;61 million and the Young Peoples Substance Misuse Grant of &pound;15 million will continue to be paid into the area-based grant for 2009-10. The Safer and Stronger Communities Fund capital element will remain at &pound;18 million and will be paid direct to local authorities by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/45"><I>Capital</I></p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/46">Capital grant and supported capital expenditure totalling &pound;220 million will be allocated in 2009-10 with each police authority receiving the same allocation as in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/47">In addition to the general provision of capital grant in 2008-09, a &pound;50 million capital fund was provided to increase the number of hand-held computers in use by front-line officers. In view of the enthusiastic response from front-line officers and the success of the programme, a further &pound;25 million capital was announced in the policing Green Paper as part of our campaign to reduce bureaucracy, making a total of &pound;75 million for the whole programme over the CSR years.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/48"><I>Efficiency</I></p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/49">Improving performance and increasing efficiency remains critical. We are acutely aware that all provisions for the police must be fully justified. At local level, as we set out in the policing Green Paper, it is for police authorities to set ambitious local targets and to hold their service to account for delivery. Full weight will have to be given to the importance of driving increased efficiency and productivity across the public sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Geoff Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/2">I am today publishing the government response to the King review of low-carbon cars. Copies of the report will be available in the House Libraries and a further copy of the report will be available on the Department for Transport website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/3">The Government warmly welcome Professor King's wide-ranging and comprehensive report, published in two parts in October 2007 and March 2008, which set out the technology options likely to contribute to decarbonising road transport. Professor King made a number of policy recommendations ensuring that government, industry and research communities all contribute to reducing carbon emissions from cars. The response document describes how the Government are taking forward Professor King's recommendations as part of our wider mission to tackle the climate change impacts of the transport sector. Professor King's report provides grounds for optimism that major reductions in road transport emissions can be achieved in ways that are technologically feasible, affordable and publicly acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/4">Professor King's recommendations have a particular emphasis on technology and removing barriers to behavioural change. There are various recommendations aimed at driving technology change through EU legislation and promoting the research, development or deployment of relevant technologies to reduce the impacts of vehicles throughout their life cycle. We are working on all these areas with a view to seeing a new car fleet average of 100 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020&mdash;a target that will require deployment of a range of technologies such as all-electric and plug-in hybrid cars that hold the promise of ultra-low-carbon private transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/5">We intend to seize the opportunities that a low-carbon transport sector represents, thereby helping to reduce the UK's emissions from domestic sources and contributing to meeting our greenhouse gas targets as set out in the Climate Change Bill 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/2">The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe is rapidly deteriorating, with an escalating cholera outbreak making an already serious situation much worse. Today I am making available a &pound;10 million package of support to provide life-saving assistance and respond to the escalation of the disease. This support will:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/3">provide essential drugs and medical supplies; support the provision of basic health services; and help UNICEF treat cholera cases and prevent further outbreaks.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/4">This package includes &pound;3 million new funding, and brings our total support to the people of Zimbabwe to &pound;47 million this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/5">With a collapsing health system and a population badly weakened by a prolonged food crisis and HIV and AIDS, the threat from cholera is all the more severe. More than 8,000 cases have already been reported, with over 300 deaths, the vast majority of them preventable under normal conditions. Our contribution will be used to provide vital medical supplies and equipment to treat patients, provide clean water supplies, and ensure that front-line health workers are available to treat patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/6">The food crisis in Zimbabwe also remains a serious challenge. The UN estimates that five million people will be in need of food aid as we move into the New Year. To date, the UK has provided &pound;9 million to the World Food Programme's appeal. With the results of nutritional surveys in the coming weeks we will, alongside the UN and other donors, monitor closely the need for further contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/7">As the group of elders noted during their recent visit to southern Africa, the need to arrest the humanitarian crisis is now urgent. There is no doubt that this has been caused by a systemic and prolonged failure of policy and leadership in Zimbabwe. Only a political solution and a major change of policy direction by the Government of Zimbabwe can provide what is needed to Zimbabwe's people. The international community will continue to support the immediate needs of the Zimbabwean people. With international partners, we stand ready to play our part in Zimbabwe's economic and social recovery when the time comes.</p>
