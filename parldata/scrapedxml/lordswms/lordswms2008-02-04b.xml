	Border and Immigration Agency: IPCC Oversight
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-02-04b.63.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="63"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80204-wms0001.htm#08020413000017">
	<p pid="b.63.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration and Minister for the West Midlands (Mr Liam Byrne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/2">The Government are soon to introduce a single border force to deliver stronger policing of ports and airports. Along with these changes we will be equipping agency staff with a wide array of police powers, such as those set out in the UK Borders Act. These include powers of detention at ports, powers to arrest a person who has committed or is about to commit an offence of assaulting an immigration officer, and powers to enter and search premises for evidence of an arrested individual's nationality.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/3">Before these powers are introduced it is important that effective oversight arrangements are in place. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-26">26 July 2007</phrase>, therefore, I announced the publication of a consultation document on matters related to the implementation of measures in the Police and Justice Act 2006 to extend the Independent Police Complaints Commission's jurisdiction to cover the Border and Immigration Agency's enforcement functions. I wish to inform the House that I am publishing today an analysis of responses; a government policy statement setting out the Government's consideration of issues raised by respondents; and regulations, subject to negative resolution, which will extend the Independent Police Complaints Commission's jurisdiction in this regard. Copies of these regulations and documents have been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/4">The IPCC will provide independent oversight of the most serious complaints, incidents and misconduct matters where police powers are used by immigration officers and officials. This oversight will be similar to that which the IPCC provides for the police and other law enforcement bodies such as Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Serious Organised Crime Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/5">The new chief inspector created by the UK Borders Act 2007 will monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's processes and practices as a whole. The IPCC will look at individual cases. The chief inspector will work closely with the IPCC to ensure comprehensive independent external scrutiny of our activities. The IPCC already oversees the work of HM Revenue and Customs colleagues, a number of whom will be joining the UK Border Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/6">I welcome this new oversight and would like to inform the House that similar oversight provisions are currently being developed for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/2">I am today announcing an independent review of the Civil Justice Council in line with Cabinet Office Guidance for Public Bodies. The Civil Justice Council was established in 1998 and has never been reviewed formally. The review is a timely opportunity to illustrate publicly the considerable achievements of the council and to help it develop further. The review will be conducted by Dr Jonathan Spencer CB and will seek the views of the members, those who work with the council and the end users of the civil justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/3">The review will examine in particular:</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/4">the council's strengths and weaknesses, the extent to which it has established itself as an authoritative influence in the civil justice world, the extent to which it has chosen important issues to address; and its success in doing so;the effectiveness of its chosen ways of working, including the council itself, its committees and the secretariat, and including the way in which it works and communicates with other organisations; andthe ways in which the council and its work should be adjusted, if at all, to maximise its effectiveness in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/5">The review is due to be complete in spring 2008.</p>

	Communities: Commission on Integration and Cohesion
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-02-04b.64.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="64"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80204-wms0001.htm#08020413000027">
	<p pid="b.64.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/2">Today I am publishing the Government's response to the Commission on Integration and Cohesion. Copies of the response have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/3">In August 2006 the Government asked Darra Singh, the chief executive of Ealing Council, to chair a commission examining the issues of integration and cohesion&mdash;how, in the light of concerns about communities living &quot;parallel lives&quot;, of changing patterns of migration, and of new technologies transforming the way people interact with each other, the Government can help build strong communities where neighbours feel at ease, share a sense of belonging, and have the opportunity to work together to shape the future of the place where they live.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/4">In June 2007, the commission delivered a serious and ambitious report based on in-depth consultation. It set out practical proposals for building cohesion and integration at a local level and contained a number of specific recommendations for government.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/5">The report has already influenced a range of policies, changing the debate about how best to bring people of different backgrounds together and empower them to influence the decisions which affect their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/6">Today, I am pleased to set out in detail my response to all 57 of the commission's recommendations&mdash;what we have already done, what we will do in the future and how we will further develop the commission's ideas.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/7">It sets out a new clarity on, and commitment to, delivering cohesive and integrated communities, backed by increased investment in cohesion of some &pound;50 million over the next three years, and a new public service agreement to drive practical action across government.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/8">At the heart of the Government's approach, like the commission's, is the principle that cohesion can only be understood and built locally. Central government's role is to set the national framework within which local authorities and their partners can deliver improvements to cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/9">Our response sets out how we will support this local delivery through six key principles:</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/10">1. a move away from a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach; 2. mainstreaming of cohesion into wider policy areas; 3. a national framework for local support and guidance, including establishing specialist cohesion teams to provide support to local authorities facing cohesion challenges and giving local authorities a tool to assess the impact their planned activities will have on cohesion;4. integration of new migrants and existing communities, starting with new guidance for local authorities on developing information packs for migrants; 5. building positive relationships; to this end we are today also publishing a consultation on guidance for funders, which encourages local authorities to consider how funding can be better used to support greater interaction; and6. sharing lessons about what works.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/11">I am grateful to Darra Singh and his commissioners for their hard work. With this response the Government are demonstrating their commitment to maintaining the momentum the report has created and helping build stronger communities where all individuals, no matter what their background, feel a sense of shared belonging, and can work with their neighbours to shape a better future for the place where they live.</p>

	Education: 14 to 19 Diplomas
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-02-04b.65.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="65"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80204-wms0001.htm#08020413000037">
	<p pid="b.65.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Mr Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/2">The first five new diplomas will be available from September 2008 and will be in construction and the built environment; creative and media; engineering; information technology; and society, health and development. We announced last March that over 800 schools and over 150 colleges would be in the first consortia offering 14 to 19 diplomas from September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/3">A breakdown of consortia offering the first five lines by region and local authority is shown in Table 1. The forecast first-year diploma funding for each region in 2008-09 is set out in Table 2, subject to final pupil numbers for each region.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/4">The next five diplomas will be available from September 2009 and will be in manufacturing and product design; business, administration and finance; land-based and environmental studies; hair and beauty; and hospitality. We can now announce that two-thirds of all secondary schools and three-quarters of colleges in England have applied to offer these five new diplomas, plus the first five diplomas, as part of consortia from September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.1/5">These figures show that diplomas are proving a popular choice for schools and colleges. Diplomas will offer learners a new route into further and higher education as well as into skilled work. In December, the independent organisation UCAS announced that the points value of the advanced diploma will be the same as that awarded for three and a half A-levels.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-02-04b.70.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="70"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80204-wms0002.htm#08020413000610">
	<p pid="b.70.1/1">The Justice and Home Affairs Informal Council was held on 25 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-26">26 January 2008</phrase> in Ljubljana. My right honourable and noble friend the Attorney-General (Baroness Scotland), my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Maria Eagle), and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Meg Hillier), attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. Since it was an informal council, no formal decisions were taken. The following main issues were discussed:</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/2">The first home affairs session opened with a report from the presidency on the work of the Future Group on EU Home Affairs Those not on the group were invited to give their views. All supported the work under way, stressing the need to prioritise data sharing, both within the EU and co-operation with third countries. In relation to other subject areas, there were suggestions that work might look at the further harmonisation of rules to manage the Schengen area, tighter border controls, measures to bring terrorists to justice and the strengthening of action in the area of civil protection and disaster response. Several delegations also raised the need to ensure that the work of the Home Affairs Group and that of the Justice Future Group were linked more closely. The new European Parliament's civil liberties, justice and home affairs (LIBE) president, G&eacute;rard Deprez, gave a general introduction to the approach of LIBE, stressing its concern for privacy and individual rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/3">The presidency concluded that interoperability of databases and the needs of law enforcement should drive future EU policy on data sharing, coupled with thorough data protection. On migration, an integrated approach to management was needed based on Frontex (the EU's border agency), operating across land and sea borders. Links with external policy should be stronger, as should data sharing, and work with and in third countries. In all these areas the EU should analyse what it already had, and then look at the next steps. The presidency noted that a final report should be prepared under the incoming French presidency, with a view to contributing to the successor to the Hague JHA work programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/4">The second session discussed practical co-operation in the field of asylum, with the presidency stressing the need for joint practical projects and asking for views on a European Support Office (ESO) which would oversee all forms of co-operation between member states on the common European asylum system. The UK welcomed practical co-operation based on an assessment of why people moved. The Commission said that its proposals on the second stage of the common European asylum system were due in July and work on an ESO should start with a feasibility study. All member states agreed that practical co-operation should be strengthened, and that there was a need for more uniform country-of-origin information. All member states also supported the ESO, but views differed as to its role and staffing. The presidency concluded that work to unify the interpretation of existing instruments, common training, and shared interpretation pool should continue. There was wide support for an ESO, but further work was needed on its tasks and financing. The presidency looked forward to the Commission's ESO study. The council would be invited to agree conclusions on this at a future session.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/5">The home affairs session closed the official programme with a working lunch, during which Ministers considered the timetable for the implementation of the second generation of the Schengen information system (SIS II). The Commission and presidency argued that member states had to set and commit to a real timetable for SIS II. More time for testing was needed, but a formal decision had to be taken at the February JHA council. Ministers agreed with a presidency proposal to remodel the oversight of the SIS II project on similar grounds to that used for SISOne4All, setting up a ministerial-level steering group of various member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/6">Ministers also had an exchange of views on the Commission's proposal on the use of the passenger name records (PNR) for law enforcement purposes. The Commission stressed the need to prevent terrorism, but protect the privacy and rights of honest travellers. At the presidency's request, the Government presented the UK's experience of using PNR data, with concrete examples of their use, proportionality and success, with the conclusion that they should be used to detect all forms of crime. While generally favouring the proposal, member states noted that it raised difficult technical and substantive issues, including concerns about data protection. The presidency concluded that there was general support for the proposal, subject to further work on the scope and to ensure data protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/7">Over lunch on the second day, Justice Ministers discussed the report on the Justice Future Group. There was no clear conclusion on whether to merge the Home Affairs and Justice Future Groups, though the presidency encouraged Ministers to co-ordinate better with their home affairs colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/8">After lunch, Justice Ministers discussed whether the e-justice portal should be opened to the public and if so how it should be co-ordinated and whether data should remain decentralised. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Maria Eagle), said that the portal should be opened up, but that issues around data protection and charges for access, if any, had to be carefully considered in each pilot.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/9">The next justice session focused on the presidency's paper (co-sponsored by the UK) on trials in absentia. The paper was unanimously welcomed as a step forward for EU criminal procedural rights. My right honourable and noble friend the Attorney-General (Baroness Scotland) congratulated the presidency on its achievement. The presidency aims to conclude agreement by the end of June.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.1/10">During their final session, Justice Ministers discussed matters of family law and, in particular, their views in relation to the proposed regulation on maintenance obligations and the proposed regulation on divorce, also known as Rome III. The UK has not opted in to either proposal. In response to a question from the presidency, a majority of Ministers agreed that the recently agreed text on the Hague convention and protocol on maintenance obligations should be signed and ratified as soon as possible, reflecting the UK's position. Further discussions took place on the desirability of eliminating obstacles to the recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions from other member states. On Rome III, a consensus view emerged that spouses ought to be able to choose the competent jurisdiction and law applicable to their divorce.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/2">Following a review of published operational casualty data to align current and historical methods of statistical recording, the number of casualties categorised as seriously injured (SI) (excluding natural cause) on Operation Herrick for 2006 has increased by one from 12 to 13. The number of Operation Telic casualties categorised as SI (excluding natural cause) for 2006 has increased by two from 19 to 21. There have been no changes to the number of very seriously injured (VSI) casualties in either operation. These changes bring the total number of SI casualties (excluding natural cause) for Op Herrick to 57 and Op Telic to 144 up to <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/3">The statistics on casualty severity which are published on the MoD internet site exclude those individuals whose condition was recorded as due to a natural cause. In a very small number of cases, however, it is not possible to confirm whether individuals are suffering from injury or disease. When casualty reporting on the MoD internet site was first established in early 2006, cases where there was uncertainty over the cause were excluded from the published statistics. However, during an exercise last year to validate and publish retrospective data for the period 2001 to 2005 for the first time, it was decided that such cases, where there is uncertainty over the cause, should be included. This ensures that all those who have suffered an injury are reported. To ensure consistency of the statistical approach, we have now added such cases into the published statistics for January 2006 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/4">These revised statistics supersede information previously released by the department into the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/5">The revised data have now been published on the MoD website at</p>

	<p pid="b.73.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January 2008</phrase>, the department published a statement on its website about the local authority business growth incentives scheme: (<a href="http://www.local">www.local</a>. communities.gov.uk/finance/labgi/statemtyr3pay.pdf).</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/3">This indicated that, following further consideration of the new legal challenges that have been made against the current LABGI scheme and the inherent uncertainty this causes to the remaining LABGI pot, the Government intended to reconsider all aspects of the approach used to distribute resources available for year 3 of the LABGI scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/4">Alongside our reconsideration of the year 3 scheme, the Government have reconsidered the payments for years 1 and 2 of LABGI, which were made on the basis of a number of Valuation Office Agency rateable value &quot;change codes&quot;. We have taken the view that there are a number of Valuation Office Agency change codes that have not previously been used in LABGI calculations, which could contain elements of business growth. In light of this, and to avoid the additional delay and uncertainty caused by further legal challenge, the Government propose to reward authorities on the basis of a wider set of codes than has so far been the case for years 1 and 2. I will set out the details shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/5">The Government are still finalising their analysis of options for allocating the resources available for year 3 of the scheme. We continue to be convinced of the value of providing incentives to encourage business growth, a view echoed by the great majority of the responses to our recent issues paper on the reform of the LABGI scheme (<I>Building </I><I>Better I</I><I>ncentives for </I><I>Local Economic Growth: R</I><I>eforms to the Local Authority Business Growth Incentives </I><I>S</I><I>cheme</I>). We also remain determined to try to achieve this policy aim for LABGI. However, the inclination of a small number of authorities to pursue legal action has created greater complexity, uncertainty and delay. Given this, it will be necessary to retain a portion of the year 3 funding as a contingency in this final year of the current scheme. I will make an announcement on year 3 methodology and the size of the contingency retained as soon as possible.</p>
