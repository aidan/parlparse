	<p pid="b.3.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/2">The money, available next year, will help local authorities enhance the physical environment of care homes providing nursing or personal care to older people. This focused support will help older people living in care homes do so with dignity and will enable care homes to be more responsive to the needs of older residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/3">A good environment can support dignity and help people feel that they are being treated with respect. Even small enhancements can have a positive impact on well-being. I hope that local authorities, care home providers and their residents will work together to find innovative ways of using this additional money to deliver higher standards of care.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/4">I announced this funding at the launch of the Dignity in Care campaign, through which I aim to stimulate a country-wide debate about the importance of care services respecting the dignity of those who use them.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/5">At the campaign launch, I invited people to join me in taking up the dignity challenge. The challenge is a clear statement of what people can expect from a service that respects dignity, backed up by &quot;dignity tests&quot; that can be used by services to see how they measure up.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/6">I also invited people to join a new network of local champions of dignity charged with challenging poor practice and raising the profile of dignity in care locally. Support for the champions and service providers will be available in the form of an online practice guide and a programme of service improvement and network support to be delivered regionally. Other aspects of the campaign include working with Investors in People UK to help us to ensure that staff themselves are treated with dignity and respect, and a commitment from the health and social care regulators to take forward this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/7">More details about the Dignity in Care campaign, the dignity challenge and how to join the champions' network can be found at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/dignityincare">www.dh.gov.uk/dignityincare</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Vernon Coaker) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/2">Tomorrow I will publish the summary of responses to the recent Home Office consultation document entitled <I>New Powers against Organised and Financial Crime</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/3">The Green Paper was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-17">17 July 2006</phrase> and invited views from stakeholders and the public on a comprehensive package of new measures that the Government believe will provide important new tools to assist the authorities in tackling organised criminality more effectively. The proposals included:</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/4">Establishing a civil prevention order to be used against individuals and organisations to prevent serious crime.Improving data-sharing within the public sector and between the private and public sectors so that financial crime may be more easily detected and prevented.Introducing new offences of assisting and encouraging crime so that those on the margins of crime can be brought to justice more easily.Amending the proceeds of crime legislation to bolster our ability to recover ill-gotten gains.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/5">During its three-month consultation period, the Green Paper generated more than 100 responses, summaries of which will be published tomorrow. The majority of responses received were overwhelmingly supportive of the proposals. As a result, the Government intend to introduce legislation in the coming Session of Parliament, the overall aim being to prevent the UK being an attractive option for organised criminals to operate in.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/6">Copies of the document, entitled <I>New Powers against Organised and Financial Crime&mdash;Summary of responses to Consultation</I>, will be available in the House of Commons Library and on the Home Office and Crime Reduction websites.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.1/2">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friend Alistair Darling, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, represented the UK for discussions on an amended proposal for a directive concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.1/3">Negotiations focused around the opt-out from the 48-hour working week and the need for a solution to the problems caused by the European Court judgments in SiMAP and Jaeger. The presidency sought views during the morning discussion on a draft presidency text of the directive. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the presidency and its subsequent tabling of an alternative section of text, it proved impossible to reach agreement, due to the refusal of a minority of five countries to agree any text that did not set an end date for the opt-out.</p>

	<p pid="b.6.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/2">The new UK legislative programme unveiled in the Queen's Speech on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November</phrase> contains significant measures of relevance and benefit to the people of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/3">The programme demonstrates the continuing partnership between the United Kingdom and Scottish Parliaments and the Government and Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/4">The Government are committed to maintaining these close working partnerships as they continue to deliver improvements to the lives of people across Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/5">The following is a summary of the legislation announced in the Queen's Speech and its impact in Scotland. This does not include draft Bills. The Bills listed in Section 1 are likely to contain provisions that require the consent of the Scottish Parliament in line with the Sewel convention. A brief description is provided of the provisions likely to require consent. Section 2 details Bills that are not likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament as the legislation is predominantly or wholly within a reserved area or has limited impact in Scotland. The list also identifies the lead Government department:</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/6"><I>Legislation likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament at introduction.</I></p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/7">Discussions will continue between the Government and the Scottish Executive on such Bills that might include provisions in devolved areas. The Bills identified within the Queen's Speech in this section are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/8">Child Support Bill (Department for Work and Pensions): mainly reserved but may include provisions in devolved areas relating to the jurisdiction of courts and the joint registration of births (births jointly registered by both parents).</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/9">Climate Change Bill (Office of Climate Change): legislation relating to climate change is likely to include provisions in devolved areas to meet a new emissions target. The environment is a devolved matter in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/10">Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill (Department of Trade and Industry): consumer protection is reserved but the legislation will include provisions creating a new National Consumer Council and Scottish equivalent with responsibilities including food safety, which is devolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/11">Further education and training (Department For Education and Skills): education is devolved but the Bill will include provisions that give Scottish Ministers functions to make arrangements directly with the Learning and Skills Council for England in relation to career development loans and shared provision of services, i.e. procurement of goods and services and the development of information technology systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/12">Serious organised crime (Home Office): likely to include provisions in reserved and devolved areas, including recognition of prevention orders and proceeds of crime, which are devolved matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.1/13">Statistics and Registration Services Bill (Her Majesty's Treasury): the new statistics board's remit will extend fully across the whole of the UK.

	<p pid="b.8.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-09">9 November 2006</phrase>, my department published the NHS financial report for the second quarter of 2006-07. This report shows that the NHS as a whole is forecasting a &pound;94 million deficit for the year, after the application of a &pound;350 million contingency established by the strategic health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.1/3">On the basis of trends in previous years, our objective of net financial balance across the NHS remains deliverable. Strategic health authorities have reported that they will be able to generate a further net contingency of &pound;100 million to offset the deficit.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.1/4">The report is available in the Library, and copies for honourable Members and noble Lords are available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. The report has also been published on the department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4140436">www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4140436</a>&amp;chk=WmhHTZ.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/2">The Government are committed to tackling poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-13">13 November</phrase>, I published <I>Lifetime Opportunities&mdash;Government's Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy for Northern Ireland</I>. This follows extensive public consultation on the future direction of new targeting social need (new TSN) policy in Northern Ireland and the results of an independent evaluation of new TSN.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/4">The new strategy will aim to:</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/5">End child poverty by 2020. Based on the estimate of approximately 130,000 children in relative income poverty in 1998-99, this means lifting 65,000 children out of poverty by 2010, on the way to eradiation by 2020; andWork towards eliminating poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/6">It will retain some important elements of its predecessor new TSN, such as promoting social inclusion (PSI) and the principle of targeting resources and effort within programmes at those areas, groups and individuals in greatest objective need. Significant changes include the introduction of a new structure, based on four key life cycles highlighting the important issues impacting on a person at these different stages of their life and a goal for each highlighting what Government wish to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/7">The commitment to end child poverty is in line with the UK target of halving child poverty by 2010, with a view to eradicating child poverty by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/8">A key feature of the strategy will be the establishment of a ministerial-led inter-departmental, cross-sectoral forum to monitor progress. Subject to the establishment of a Northern Ireland Executive, it is intended that the forum will be chaired by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, David Hanson MP, who has lead responsibility for taking forward work to tackle poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.1/9">Copies of <I>Lifetime Opportunities</I> have been placed in the Libraries and is also available at <a href="http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/central-anti-poverty-unit">www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/central-anti-poverty-unit</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.12.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office is today publishing the <I>Social Enterprise Action Plan: Scaling new heights</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.1/2">There are at least 55,000 social enterprises in the UK, generating a turnover of more than &pound;27 billion and contributing more than &pound;8 billion to GDP a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.1/3">Since the launch of the Government social enterprise strategy in 2002, the Government have created a new legal form, the community interest company; improved business support and advice and the availability of finance; and supported the establishment of the Social Enterprise Coalition to provide a unified voice for the sector to work with Government in raising the profile of social enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.1/4">Building on this progress, the action plan is about creating the conditions for social enterprises to thrive as part of a next phase of support, and sets out the Government's role to take actions forward as part of their continuing commitment to social enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.1/5">This action plan commits us to:</p>
	<p pid="b.12.1/6">fostering a culture of social enterprise, by building the evidence and raising awareness of the impact of social enterprise, and promoting successful role models to attract new entrants, customers, financiers and support providers.ensuring that the right information and advice are available to those running social enterprises so that they can gain access to appropriate support to maximise their business performance and, in turn, their social impact.enabling social enterprises to access appropriate finance, by tackling barriers that might prevent investors from supporting social enterprises, or social enterprises from seeking financial support.enabling social enterprises to work with Government, where they can offer public benefits in the markets they operate in, ensuring that policy-makers and commissioners are aware of the role they can play.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.1/7">Copies of the action plan have been placed in the Library for the reference of noble Lords and are also available in the Printed Paper Office. The action plan is also available on the Cabinet Office website at <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/thirdsector">www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/thirdsector</a>.</p>
