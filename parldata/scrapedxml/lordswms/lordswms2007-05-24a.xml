	<p pid="a.54.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Science and Innovation, Malcolm Wicks, has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/2">The following Statement provides information on the Competitiveness Council in Brussels on 21 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May 2007</phrase>, at which I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/3"><I>Day </I><I>one:</I><I> Monday</I><I>,</I><I> 21 Ma</I><I>y</I></p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/4">The council opened with a progress report on better regulation under the German presidency. There were also progress reports from the presidency on the mutual recognition (goods) regulation and on a common framework for the marketing of products (the new approach). The council noted progress on these dossiers without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/5">Council conclusions on industrial policy were adopted. The main debate revolved around sectoral issues. Compromise wording regarding the financing of ship-building was agreed. Text was also agreed on plans to reduce CO2 emissions from cars, where member states called on the Commission to carry out a full impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/6">At the request of several member states, the Commission then presented its consumer policy strategy, which was published earlier this year. Member states did not intervene. A Council resolution is expected to be agreed at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council on <phrase class="date" code="">30 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/7">The next item on the agenda was the consumer credit directive on which political agreement was reached. Discussion centred on the optional threshold below which those repaying a loan early should not have to pay compensation to lenders for the loss of agreed interest. Eventually, member states agreed to a compromise level of &euro;10,000, thus enabling political agreement on a common position to be reached. The Netherlands and Greece voted against, and Belgium and Luxembourg abstained. I intervened to enter a minutes statement regretting the failure to carry out an impact assessment on this proposal and stressing that it should not set a precedent for other work in the field of financial services.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/8"><I>Day </I><I>two</I><I>: Tuesday</I><I>,</I> <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/9">The second day was devoted to research and space business. The fourth meeting of the Space Council was held between the Competitiveness Council and the council of the European Space Agency (ESA). I, along with a number of space Ministers, made brief statements about the importance of a European space policy (ESP). The council resolution on European space policy was unanimously adopted after Ministers' interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/10">Under the research items, the presidency reported on progress on negotiations on the European Institute of Technology on which I, and other member states, noted a number of outstanding issues which needed to be resolved, notably concerning financing.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/11">The Commission presented its first two proposals for council regulations to establish joint technology initiatives, one on innovative medicines and the other on embedded computing systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/12">A discussion took place on the European research area green paper, following the exchange at the informal meeting in Wurzburg in May. Member states emphasised the importance of the debate and welcomed the Commission's consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/13">Linked to this discussion, council conclusions were adopted on research infrastructures, inviting member states to take forward the work of the European Strategic Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/14">Items covering other business were taken over the two days.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/15">Luxembourg raised concerns about the impact of the proposal for a regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome 1). I, supported by a number of other member states, echoed Luxembourg's concerns about its potential impact on the single market and regretted the lack of an impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/16">In addition, the council noted, without debate, information provided by the presidency on the following items:</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/17">the outcome of the Wurzburg informal Competitiveness Council on the internal market in global competition; the state of play of the proposal for a directive on improving the effectiveness of review procedures concerning the award of public contracts; the proposal for a directive amending directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community;the proposal for a directive laying down rules on nominal quantities for pre-packed products;the European conference on innovation and market access through standardisation (Berlin, 26 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-27">27 March 2007</phrase>);the 4th European conference on craft industries (Stuttgart, 16 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-17">17 April 2007</phrase>) (9095/07);the European conference on tourism (Berlin/Potsdam, 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May 2007</phrase>);the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) Conference (Munich, <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-17">17 April 2007</phrase>); andthe forthcoming Euro-Med research and education Ministers' conference (Cairo, <phrase class="date" code="">18 June 2007</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/18">The council noted the information provided by the Commission concerning the regulation on a globally harmonised system of classification and labelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/19">The council also noted information from the Commission regarding forthcoming proposals to establish joint national research programmes under Article 169 of the treaty, to be presented during 2007 and 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/20">At Poland's request, the council took note of the information on Poland's proposal to organise the exhibition Expo 2012 in Wroclaw.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/21">The council noted the information provided by the Italian delegation on Milan's candidacy to host Expo 2015 with the theme of &quot;Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/22">The council took note of the information provided by the Portuguese delegation on the work programme of the incoming presidency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-05-24a.59.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70524-wms0002.htm#07052473000237">
	<p pid="a.59.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Meg Munn, has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government intends to publish on <phrase class="date" code="">29 May</phrase>, for consultation, her proposed changes to the draft revision of the regional spatial strategy for the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3">The current regional spatial strategy, initially published as regional planning guidance (RPG1), became the regional spatial strategy in September 2004 with the enactment of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. The regional spatial strategy is part of the statutory development plan and sets the framework for the production of local development frameworks and local transport plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/4">A draft revision of the regional spatial strategy was submitted to the Government in June 2005 by the North East Assembly, and tested in an examination in public during March and April 2006. The report of the examination in public was published by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in August 2006. The next step is to publish the Secretary of State's proposed changes for consultation, prior to finalisation and publication of the regional spatial strategy by the Secretary of State. On final publication it will supersede the current regional spatial strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/5">In proposing these changes, the Secretary of State has considered the recommendations of the independent panel that conducted the examination in public and has also taken into account all the representations made on the draft revision and changes in government policy since the draft revision was submitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/6">The regional spatial strategy will set a framework for the development of the north-east region to 2021. It supports a continuing level of economic growth and a broad strategy for the location of new development. It includes proposals for the location of the main areas of housing and employment growth, and for improvements to the quality and management of transport infrastructure. It has policies to address climate change, waste management and environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/7">Also being published are the reports of a sustainability appraisal of the proposed changes and a draft appropriate assessment of the regional spatial strategy revision, in accordance with the European habitats directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/8">At the start of the consultation, I will be writing to the North East Assembly with the proposed changes. Because a number of these changes involve new proposals by the Government, or the gathering of new information from the North East Assembly and other stakeholders, we have set in progress a two-stage consultation. During an initial 10-week period, we are requesting the North East Assembly and other stakeholders to provide additional information to help to finalise policies. After ministerial consideration of this, and all other representations, a further set of proposed changes will be published, for a further consultation lasting eight weeks. Whilst this will extend the overall timetable, we believe that this is justified in order to give all stakeholders a full opportunity to consider all the relevant material and the Secretary of State's final proposals. Following consideration of responses to the consultation, the Secretary of State expects to publish the finalised regional spatial strategy for the north-east early in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/9">Copies of the relevant documents, together with the reports of the sustainability appraisal and appropriate assessment, will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses at the end of May and will be provided to all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>
