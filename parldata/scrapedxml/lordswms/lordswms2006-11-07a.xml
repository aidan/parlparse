	<p pid="a.27.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/2">I am publishing today the Government's response to the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee's report of <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August</phrase> on reform of the coroners' system and death certification. Copies have been placed in the Libraries. It will also be made available on the Department for Constitutional Affairs website.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/3">The draft Coroners Bill was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June</phrase>. In the Bill we aim to do three things. First, we will improve the way that the system serves the public interest and meets bereaved families' concerns. The Bill will give families involved in the inquest process a clear legal standing in the system. We will also give families new rights through a new complaints and appeals system, enabling them to challenge a coroner's decision, and the introduction of a charter for bereaved people, which lays out the level of service that families can expect. Secondly, we will strengthen coroners' work. The Bill will establish a proper appointments system for coroners, who will have to be legally qualified and will have to work full time as coroners, instead of having another job and working part time as coroners. Thirdly, we will create a national structure for coroners' work. For the first time there will be a Chief Coroner, who will provide national leadership for coroners, as the Lord Chief Justice does for judges. This will be supported by national standards, a coronial advisory council, a proper inspection system and national training for coroners and their officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/4">I thank the committee for its thorough inquiry into our proposals to reform the coroners system, as set out in the draft Coroners Bill, and for the additional consideration it gave to death certification. The Government regard pre-legislative scrutiny as a vital step in the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/5">Our public consultation exercise on the Bill has almost concluded. We are considering very carefully the views put forward about our proposals before finalising the Bill for parliamentary introduction as soon as time allows.</p>

I regret this error and now attach the whole reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/3">Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold): To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many redundancies there were in her department in each year since 1997; what the cost of such redundancies was in each year; how many temporary staff were employed in each year; and how many staff were seconded by outside organisations to posts within the department in each year. (95254)</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/4">The Minister for Europe (Mr. Geoff Hoon): The rules governing redundancies are set out by the Cabinet Office and include schemes for compulsory early retirement (CER) for officers over 50 and compulsory early severance (CES) for those under 50.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/5">The annual number of junior/middle management officers in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) who have taken redundancy through the CER or CES schemes for the years 1997 to 2006 are shown below and include efficiency restructuring in FCO Services. Costs shown for 1997 to 2001 are the total for all early retirements in each of those years. We could not break these figures down further without incurring disproportionate costs. The costs from 2002 to 2006 cover redundancy packages only.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.1/22">Since 1995, we have given FCO senior management staff the opportunity to volunteer for early retirement on CER or CES terms if they complete a full posting before retirement age or had been unable to find a suitable appointment within the department. To meet efficiency targets, in particular to reduce substantially the number of staff in the senior management structure, we extended this offer to a wider range of senior officers in September 2004, using funding from HM Treasury's Efficiency Challenge Fund. The numbers of officers who took early retirement on these terms since 1997 are shown below. As mentioned previously, the costs for 1997 to 2001 are totals covering all early retirements; to provide a further breakdown would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.0/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Health Services (Rosie Winterton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>, in a Written Answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the honourable Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> <I>Official Report</I>, col. 1331W, I stated that 187,086 tattoos were removed by the NHS between April 2004 and March 2005. I regret that this figure was incorrect.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/3">A variety of procedures are used to remove tattoos, which are also used in the treatment of other skin conditions. NHS information systems do not record sufficient detail to allow distinction between procedures to remove tattoos and procedures to treat other skin conditions. The Answer was based on a mistaken attempt to estimate the number of tattoos from the information on the wider grouping of skin procedures. That attempt was intended to be helpful, but ended up being misleading, first, because it is not possible from the existing data sets to say with any precision how many tattoos are removed by the NHS each year and, secondly, because clinical advice is that it is likely to be a far smaller number than the figure given.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/4">I have received a formal apology from the Information Centre, which accepts full responsibility for providing an incorrect response to the parliamentary Question.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/5">The Information Centre and the Department of Health place the highest importance on the integrity of information, and I have been assured by the chief executive of the Information Centre and the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health that appropriate steps are being taken to ensure that a similar situation does not recur. I apologise to the House for the error.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.2/5">The Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 will further strengthen our powers to freeze assets, including the property of persons listed at the United Nations under the relevant UN Security Council resolutions or who we suspect are persons acting on their behalf, and to prevent funds or economic resources being made available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/6"><I>North Korea (United Nations Measures) Order 2006</I></p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/7">Following North Korea's announced nuclear test, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-14">14 October 2006</phrase> to adopt resolution 1718 (2006), which calls upon all member states to impose sanctions against North Korea's nuclear, ballistic missile and other weapons of mass destruction-related programmes.
