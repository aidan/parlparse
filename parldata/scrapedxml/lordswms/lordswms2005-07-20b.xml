	<p pid="b.103.1/1">The sorting of incoming parliamentary mail, its preparation for delivery or forwarding, and collection and dispatch of outward mail, have been provided by Royal Mail to both Houses for many years on an informal contractual basis, subject to annual revision in line with rising costs. In 2004 it was decided that, in order to comply with EU procurement rules and to ensure value for money, these mail services would be the subject of a full tender exercise. Following the placing of an advertisement in the <i>Official Journal</i>, and the drafting of a full specification, four companies, including Royal Mail, were invited to tender. The award of the contract to Royal Mail, subject to agreement of detailed contractual terms, is being announced today to the parties concerned. It will run for three years from August 2005. Costs for the service are expected to be between &pound;1 million and &pound;1.5 million a year, shared between both Houses, of which the House of Lords share is 15 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/2">The new contract will provide for a significantly enhanced service to Parliament. More mail will be delivered to offices first thing in the morning; the 7 pm collection will apply to all post boxes on the estate; forwarding will be more efficiently handled off-site; and there will be a rigorous and robust set of service standards, with regular service reviews and customer input. The price will be reviewed in line with RPI over years two and three of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/3">This contract is quite separate from that for off-site screening of incoming mail, which will from August 2005 be carried out by Pitney Bowes under a separate contract let in 2004. These contracts are also separate from that which governs the provision by Post Office Counters of postal services at its three outlets on the Parliamentary Estate, which is still being negotiated.</p>

The report includes information on licensing decisions made during 2004 as well as describing UK policy and international developments in export control regimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/2">The Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls is an innovation of this Government. Our defence export licensing system is one of the most rigorous and open regimes in the world and the annual report symbolises our commitment to accountability and transparency. Since 2004 the Government have also produced quarterly reports. This will be the Government's eighth annual report (the first report was published in 1997). The report will be available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a> and also published through The Stationery Office. This year, due to the increasing volume of information on strategic exports that is being published by the Government, the annual report will be available on a CD-ROM. This CD will also include quarterly reports in 2004, information on licence refusals and further information on trade licences issued.</p>
