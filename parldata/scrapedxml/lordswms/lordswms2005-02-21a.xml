<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-02-21a.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050221/text/50221-42.htm#50221-42_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.47.1/1">The Prime Minister's Strategy Unit published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-17">17 February</phrase> a report entitled <i>Investing in Prevention: An International Strategy to Manage Risks of Instability and Improve Crisis Response</i>. Copies of this report to government will be placed in the Library of the House today. It follows the publication by the Strategy Unit in November 2003 of its Strategic Audit, which recommended increased strategic focus on instability and conflict prevention. The report contains the Strategy Unit's analysis of the main risk factors associated with conflict and instability and a series of recommendations by the Strategy Unit for how to address these. Preventing conflict and building stability are fundamental to the Government's foreign policy. This report by the Strategy Unit provides further material on which to draw in support of this agenda and departments will be looking carefully at its recommendations.</p>
