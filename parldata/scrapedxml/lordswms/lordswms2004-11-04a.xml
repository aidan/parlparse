	Guantanamo Bay: British Detainees
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-11-04a.9.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="9"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo041104/text/41104-34.htm#41104-35_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.9.3/1">A Foreign and Commonwealth Office official visited Guantanamo Bay between 2 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-05">5 October 2004</phrase> to check on the welfare of the four British detainees. This was the ninth welfare visit to Guantanamo Bay.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/2">The FCO official saw all the UK detainees individually. US officials observed the meetings. The FCO official talked to all the British detainees about mail, their health, exercise, diet, living conditions, treatment by the camp authorities and status, the value of the welfare visits and about the British Government's policy towards their detention. The detainees' families have been given details of the visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/3">The official gave personal mail and reading material to the detainees and brought mail back to their families in reply. The detainees are also able to send and receive mail through the camp authorities and ICRC. Delivery times have been irregular but are improving following a review of the US mail system.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/4">The British detainees appeared in sound physical health, are frustrated by their continued detention but heartened by recent access to legal representation (in the case of three of the detainees). Individual medical and detention matters raised during this and previous welfare visits by the detainees were pursued with the camp authorities. Most have now been addressed. The Government will continue to pursue the outstanding matters. All the detainees said that they welcomed the welfare visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/5">The official explained the British Government's policy towards their detention&mdash;that in absence of a fair trial the British detainees should be returned to the UK&mdash;and that talks between the British and US Governments on their detention continued. The official also explained to two detainees designated for trial by Military Commission that the legal proceedings concerned remained suspended.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/6">The camp authorities were open and co-operative throughout the visit.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.5/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that regulations are necessary, give effective protection, balance cost and risk, are fair and command public confidence. In accordance with this, we require departments to produce and publish regulatory impact assestments (RIAs) for all regulatory proposals likely to have an impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, RIAs have also been carried out on proposals with a significant impact on the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.5/2">I have today presented to Parliament a Command Paper (Cm 6329) listing RIAs published between <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase>. Copies of those listed have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. This is the 21st such Command Paper.</p>
