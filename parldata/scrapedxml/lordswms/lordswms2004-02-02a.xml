	Iraq: Export Licence Applications
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-02-02a.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="13"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040202/text/40202-46.htm#40202-46_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.13.1/1">Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a further licence to export military list goods to Iraq. The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of &quot;arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions&quot;. Accordingly, Her Majesty's Government consider it appropriate to grant exemptions for the export of riot shields which are to be used by Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) peacekeeping forces in Iraq. The export is consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis against the UN embargo and consolidated criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.</p>

	Crick Report: Government Response
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-02-02a.13.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="13"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040202/text/40202-46.htm#40202-46_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.13.3/1">I am pleased to be able to announce today the Government's initial response to <i>The New and the Old</i>, the report of the Life in the United Kingdom advisory group, chaired by Professor Sir Bernard Crick, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-03">3 September 2003</phrase>. The group was established in order to advise the Government on the best way of implementing the provisions in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which would require prospective British citizens to demonstrate knowledge of English, Welsh or Gaelic and of life in the United Kingdom. I repeat today the warm welcome we gave to the report on its appearance and my thanks to Sir Bernard and his fellow members of the advisory group.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/2">I will be placing in the Library of the House our responses to each of the recommendations; I summarise below our conclusions on what we consider to be the most important of the report's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/3">We agree that the programme of citizenship studies should be drawn up under the six broad headings of British national institutions in recent historical context, Britain as a diverse society, knowing the law, employment, sources of help and information, and everyday needs. We also accept that a bilingual handbook on life in the United Kingdom should be prepared for the information of all who apply at posts abroad for entry clearance in a category which leads to settlement, and work on the preparation of such a handbook is already well advanced under the auspices of the advisory group.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/4">We accept the group's reasons for concluding that the language criterion for citizenship should be satisfied by evidence that a person has made measurable progress in his or her studies, rather than insisting on a single standard for everyone. For most applicants who are not already fluent, this would mean that they would be required to progress by one English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) level. As a minimum, those with no workable English, or one of the other UK languages, would be expected to progress at least to a basic level of competence.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/5">The advisory group also recommended that free assessments and tuition should be made available to all who have a route to indefinite leave to remain. The report points out that knowledge of English in particular greatly increases employment prospects, leading to less welfare dependence and greater integration into society. At the same time, the potential cost of full implementation is very high, and the Government cannot undertake to fund it in full in advance of the outcome of next year's spending review. We will study further both the possibility of full implementation of this recommendation and possible alternative ways of targeting our resources on those most in need of help in acquiring linguistic skills, and we will announce our conclusions as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/6">In addition, and in advance of the spending review, we are continuing with development work on possible means of assessment, delivery mechanisms, and the programmes of study themselves. We will explore the practicalities of piloting language with citizenship programmes from within existing resources in some areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/7">Finally, the advisory group proposed that an advisory board on preparation for naturalisation should be set up. The functions of such an advisory board would expand over time, as the 2002 legislation is implemented, but its early tasks would be to advise on the development of resources for the citizenship curriculum and to oversee the process of implementation of the 2002 legislation. The board may have a role in negotiations with the devolved areas of the UK on how they would wish these proposals to be implemented there. We have agreed in principle to the setting up of the board.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, David Lammy, has today announced a package of measures, which will help to achieve better value for money in the legal aid system while ensuring that help continues to go to those who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/2">The package draws upon proposals contained in the consultation paper on the Criminal Defence Service (CDS) <i>Delivering Value for Money in the Criminal Defence Service</i>, which was published last year. After considering the responses to the consultation my honourable friend intends to introduce the following changes to the CDS:</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/3" class="indent">Strengthening the operation of recovery of defence costs orders (RDCOs).</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/4" class="indent">Abolishing advocacy assistance for early hearings.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/5" class="indent">Restricting the scope of the court duty solicitor scheme to remove access for clients who are not in custody and who are charged with non-imprisonable offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/6" class="indent">Abolish post-charge advice and assistance in criminal proceedings (except that provided by the court duty solicitor).</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/7" class="indent">Limiting the provision of free police station advice in certain cases to telephone advice only (with limited exceptions).</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/8">He believes that these changes strike the right balance between ensuring the taxpayer receives good value for money while ensuring that publicly funded legal aid is available to those who need it most. The impact of these proposals will of course be kept under review.</p>
