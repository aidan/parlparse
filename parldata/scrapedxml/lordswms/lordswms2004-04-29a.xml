<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-04-29a.37.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="37"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040429/text/40429-29.htm#40429-29_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.37.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">In 2002, the UK agreed to contribute &pound;900 million to the 13th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional lending arm which is designed to meet the needs of the world's poorest countries. In addition to this contribution, the UK set aside another &pound;100 million to be provided on condition that a satisfactory framework was agreed to compensate the IDA for the costs of introducing grants under its 13th replenishment (IDA 13). Both the initial &pound;900 million contribution and the additional provisional contribution of &pound;100 million were approved by Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-03">3 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">I am pleased to announce that a satisfactory framework for compensating IDA 13 for the introduction of grants has now been agreed. Under this framework, donors will compensate IDA upfront for the administrative costs associated with providing grants, through making additional contributions to the next replenishment (IDA 14). (These are costs which arise early in the project cycle and, in the case of loans, would be covered by recipient countries.) Meanwhile, donors will compensate for the lost reflows from recipient countries as and when these would have fallen due. Given the 10-year grace period provided under IDA on repayment of loans, this would not have happened until 2013 at the earliest. Compensation payments will not therefore be required until this time, and the exact means of compensation will be discussed as part of future IDA replenishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/4">An essential and fundamental principle of the agreed grants compensation framework is that donors should contribute to the cost of compensation in line with their share of IDA 13 (their &quot;burden share&quot;). If the UK were to contribute the full &pound;100 million set aside to cover the costs of upfront compensation, we would effectively displace the contributions of other donors. We have therefore decided to cover both our burden share under IDA 13, and the structural financing gap inherent in this replenishment (equivalent to 9.37 per cent of total resource needs from donors), making a total UK contribution for upfront IDA 13 grants compensation of &pound;64.8 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.3/1">The Director of Public Prosecutions has, in accordance with Section 7A of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 as amended by Section 53 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, extended the remit of work that may be undertaken by Crown Prosecution Service designated caseworkers.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/2">Designated caseworkers are now permitted to undertake all work in the magistrates' court other than: trials; proofs in absence in either-way cases; committals and sendings; pre-trial reviews; Newton hearings; contested bail hearings.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/3">The extended remit of designated caseworkers will enhance the role of the designated caseworker and enable more effective court listing. It will also support the effective delivery by the Crown Prosecution Service of pre-charge advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/4">A designated caseworker will not be permitted to undertake the extended remit until successfully completing a training programme and receiving a personal letter of appointment from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.1/1">The Government have issued an open licence for the export to Iran of goods that will be listed in the United Kingdom strategic export controls annual report as &quot;components for military aero engines&quot;. The goods will be used by the oil and gas industry to overhaul turbines that power pumps for oil and gas pipelines. The goods are military listed because they were originally designed and used for military aircraft engines. In this instance, the Government are satisfied that there is a minimal risk of diversion to a military end use and are prepared to make an exception to the UK national arms embargo. Other aspects of the application were considered against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.3/1">I have today laid before the House a statement of changes to the immigration rules. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, as a result of the accession of 10 new states to the European Union, nationals of those EU accession states will not require immigration leave to enter or stay in the UK. Consequently it is necessary to remove all references to the individual EU accession states in the immigration rules with effect from the date of accession.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/2">We have also decided to amend the European Economic Area (EEA) national settlement requirements to enable those currently in immigration categories leading to settlement to aggregate time spent here under the immigration rules with that as an EEA national in the UK when making an application to settle. This ensures that new EU nationals will not have to spend a longer time in the UK to qualify for settlement than they would if accession had not occurred. This mirrors the practice followed in previous accessions.</p>
