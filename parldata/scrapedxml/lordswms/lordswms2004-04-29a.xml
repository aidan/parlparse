<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-04-29a.37.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="37"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040429/text/40429-29.htm#40429-29_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.37.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">In 2002, the UK agreed to contribute &pound;900 million to the 13th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional lending arm which is designed to meet the needs of the world's poorest countries. In addition to this contribution, the UK set aside another &pound;100 million to be provided on condition that a satisfactory framework was agreed to compensate the IDA for the costs of introducing grants under its 13th replenishment (IDA 13). Both the initial &pound;900 million contribution and the additional provisional contribution of &pound;100 million were approved by Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-03">3 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">I am pleased to announce that a satisfactory framework for compensating IDA 13 for the introduction of grants has now been agreed. Under this framework, donors will compensate IDA upfront for the administrative costs associated with providing grants, through making additional contributions to the next replenishment (IDA 14). (These are costs which arise early in the project cycle and, in the case of loans, would be covered by recipient countries.) Meanwhile, donors will compensate for the lost reflows from recipient countries as and when these would have fallen due. Given the 10-year grace period provided under IDA on repayment of loans, this would not have happened until 2013 at the earliest. Compensation payments will not therefore be required until this time, and the exact means of compensation will be discussed as part of future IDA replenishments.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/4">An essential and fundamental principle of the agreed grants compensation framework is that donors should contribute to the cost of compensation in line with their share of IDA 13 (their &quot;burden share&quot;). If the UK were to contribute the full &pound;100 million set aside to cover the costs of upfront compensation, we would effectively displace the contributions of other donors. We have therefore decided to cover both our burden share under IDA 13, and the structural financing gap inherent in this replenishment (equivalent to 9.37 per cent of total resource needs from donors), making a total UK contribution for upfront IDA 13 grants compensation of &pound;64.8 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/2">The Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, as amended by the Boundary Commissions Act 1992 requires that the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland undertake periodical reviews of constituencies in Northern Ireland. The commission is required to submit a report to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland not less than eight or more than 12 years from its last report.

	<p pid="a.39.1/1">The Government have issued an open licence for the export to Iran of goods that will be listed in the United Kingdom strategic export controls annual report as &quot;components for military aero engines&quot;. The goods will be used by the oil and gas industry to overhaul turbines that power pumps for oil and gas pipelines. The goods are military listed because they were originally designed and used for military aircraft engines. In this instance, the Government are satisfied that there is a minimal risk of diversion to a military end use and are prepared to make an exception to the UK national arms embargo. Other aspects of the application were considered against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.3/1">I have today laid before the House a statement of changes to the immigration rules. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, as a result of the accession of 10 new states to the European Union, nationals of those EU accession states will not require immigration leave to enter or stay in the UK. Consequently it is necessary to remove all references to the individual EU accession states in the immigration rules with effect from the date of accession.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/2">We have also decided to amend the European Economic Area (EEA) national settlement requirements to enable those currently in immigration categories leading to settlement to aggregate time spent here under the immigration rules with that as an EEA national in the UK when making an application to settle. This ensures that new EU nationals will not have to spend a longer time in the UK to qualify for settlement than they would if accession had not occurred. This mirrors the practice followed in previous accessions.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">The Ministry of Defence is continually examining ways of improving military capability and value for money for the taxpayer, including by keeping the size and location of our bases under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-14">14 August 2003</phrase>, I announced a review of the future basing requirement for the RAF's air combat service support units (ACSSUs), elements of the air surveillance and control system (ASACS) and some other minor units and the potential impact on the future requirement for RAF Boulmer, RAF Neatishead, RAF Sealand and RAF Stafford, should relocation of units currently based there be recommended.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/4">The primary objective of this particular review was to meet the department's basing needs in the light of the move towards expeditionary operations. A number of options were identified on which my officials have consulted widely. A number of honourable Members have made representations. The review has now concluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/5">I am now able to inform the House that I am inclined, subject to formal consultation with the trade unions, to accept the option which creates an ACSSU communications hub and a base for ASACS units at RAF Scampton and an ACSSU logistics hub at RAF Wittering. Implementation of this option as a whole would be over an extended period, beginning later this year and not complete until about 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/6">This option offers the greatest operational flexibility to our Armed Forces by collocating support units on main operating bases. It is also the most cost-effective solution. It would mean that communications personnel would relocate to Scampton from RAF Sealand (from 2005) and RAF Brize Norton (from 2005), together with ASACS units currently based at RAF Neatishead (from 2004&ndash;05) and RAF Boulmer (from 2009), bringing the total number of people at the station up to around 2,400 by 2012. In the case of RAF Wittering, logistics personnel would relocate from RAF Stafford (from 2005). This would increase the number of personnel at the station to around 2,130 by 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/7">The Ministry of Defence has written to the trade unions to ask for their formal response to this option by <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-07">7 June 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/8">I will make my decision when I have received trade unions' comments and will inform the House at that time.</p>
