	Airports: Heathrow Air Quality Report
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-07-19a.89.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="89"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60719-wms0167.htm#06071965000017">
	<p pid="a.89.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/2">I have today published the technical report of the air quality technical panels instituted after the 2003 air transport White Paper to review the basis on which air quality assessments should be carried out for Heathrow airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/3">We continue to support further development at Heathrow, including the addition of a short, third runway in the 2015 to 2020 period, after a new runway at Stansted, but only if we can be confident that the conditions set out in the White Paper can be met. Publishing this report is a significant milestone in the programme of work to review the scope for meeting those conditions. I am grateful to the panel members who have devoted their energies over the past two years to a very full review of the issues and who have produced a detailed and comprehensive report.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/4">The report has been peer reviewed and I amhappy to accept its recommendations. It isprimarily concerned with methodology&mdash;how future assessments of air quality around Heathrow should be conducted. It does not attempt to prejudge the question of whether development at Heathrow is more or less likely to be achievable within the critical air quality limits. But, importantly, it provides a sound scientific basis on which we can now proceed to carry out the remaining stages of the work to address that question in the coming months, building on the panels' recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/5">Copies of the report are available in the Library and full details will be available on the department's website.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/2">I am pleased to announce progress on the complex weapons sector of the defence industrial strategy (DIS). This sector provides key missile development capabilities to our Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/3">The DIS identified that maintaining the industrial capability that we wished to retain onshore represented a substantial challenge given that we expect investment in new systems to decrease in the next five years from the current level due to a sharp decline in market size. We undertook to work with UK industry to meet this challenge and can now announce that we are forming a &quot;Team Complex Weapons&quot;. &quot;Team CW&quot; is led by MBDA and is centred around QinetiQ, Thales Air Defence Limited, Thales Missile Electronics and Roxel. &quot;Team CW&quot; will enable the UK to maintain key skills and technologies through a mixture of directed procurements and open competition, enabling controlled restructuring to take place while maintaining onshore access to the capabilities that our Armed Forces require.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/4">Together, we will develop &quot;Team CW&quot; during the second half of this year. We intend to agree a strategic partnering agreement in 2006. This will require contractually binding measures focused on business transformation both within the Ministry of Defence and within industry, allowing better-informed through-life decisions to be made and a more incremental approach to technology insertion to be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/5">We intend to use a range of programmesto incentivise the restructuring process. Most significantly, we have changed our procurement strategy for the loitering munition demonstration and manufacture programme, potentially worth more than &pound;500 million. It will be single-sourced to the MBDA-led &quot;Team CW&quot;, subject to an enduring requirement for this technology, to affordability and to the ability to clearly demonstrate value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/6">We are also announcing four contracts for the development of technologies to contribute to the enhancement of Storm Shadow, and the future anti-surface and future rapid effects programmes, which will offer significant opportunities for collaboration. In the support area, we have placed a contract for availability known as PROJECT RevISE, which covers air-launched weapons designed by MBDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/7">Our joint approach with industry will enable usto develop a globally competitive industry that will deliver the technologically advanced missiles that our Armed Forces will need in the future.</p>

	Disability: Remploy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-07-19a.91.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="91"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60719-wms0167.htm#06071965000034">
	<p pid="a.91.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions(Mrs Anne McGuire) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/2">Increasing the number of disabled people whom we support into work is a core part of our welfare reform agenda. This is central to meeting the department's aim of an 80 per cent employment rate and central to ensuring equality of opportunity for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/3">Remploy was set up after the Second World War to provide employment to facilitate rehabilitation and progression to open employment. Employing around 5,000 disabled people, the Remploy factories are engaged in a wide range of sectors ranging from office furniture through textiles to electronics. These industry sectors have experienced significant change over the past 60 years, not least through increased international competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/4">In addition, the way in which we support disabled people into work has evolved. Strengthened disability rights mean that we are now in a stronger position to support people in a mainstream environment. This is why Remploy developed its Interwork business, which supported 4,300 people into jobs in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/5">These changes have raised significant questions about the future strategy for Remploy. That is why in March I commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers and Stephen Duckworth, a disability expert with wide experience of disability rights and employment issues, to conduct a strategic review of the future business options for the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/6">Today, I have published the findings of the review. Copies of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report have been made available in the Libraries, Vote and Printed Paper Offices and on the DWP website, <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2006/remploy">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2006/remploy</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/7">The report delivers a hard-hitting financial assessment of the challenges facing Remploy. Factories are facing growing cost pressures as aresult of increased international competition and technological development. The average cost per employee is &pound;18,000 per year and over &pound;48,000 in the household and toiletries factory&mdash;far greater than, say, the &pound;5,000 cost per head of other Workstep providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/8">The report sets out a range of possible scenarios for the business, from no change to complete closure of the factory network. I am ruling out both these options.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/9">It is clear from both this report and that of the National Audit Office that doing nothing is not an option. This view is shared by the Remploy board, its management and the trade unions. The necessity for change is clear, but I believe that there is still a role for sheltered employment in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/10">We recognise that change will have an inevitable impact on the disabled people whom Remploy employs. We want to give Remploy the time and support to determine the best way to modernise and restructure its business. We intend, therefore, to provide the necessary funding to enable this to happen&mdash;in particular, so that there is sufficient time to consider factory reorganisation as part of an overall restructuring package. This is not a cuts package for Remploy; on the contrary, we will be maintaining the baseline funding and investing more this year to help to deal with the short-term issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/11">I will be asking the board of Remploy to undertake the preliminary work to bring forward later next year a five-year restructuring plan with proposals both to modernise the business and to support substantially larger numbers of disabled people into work. Full consultation will take place with the trade unions and employees in developing this strategy. I will be making it clear that any such proposals must protect Remploy's disabled employees from compulsory redundancy. Once this plan is brought forward, we will consider whether we are able to offer the board additional funding for modernisation; we will also consider at that stage with the chair whether we need to enhance the range of skills on the board to help it to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/12">Currently, Remploy supports around 9,000 disabled people in factory employment, Interwork and managed services. In the longer term, our ambition is that any restructuring should enable us to help significantly more disabled people in work than if we continue with the status quo, thus providing substantially more opportunities for disabled people and better value for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.3/13">The efforts of Remploy's existing workforce, its chair, current board and supporters must not be underestimated or taken for granted. They have much to be proud of. But Remploy cannot stand still and we need to examine how the ideals that lay behind its creation 60 years ago can fit the world that it now faces.</p>

	Housing: Supporting People Programme

	<p pid="a.93.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" name="Phil Woolas">My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (Phil Woolas)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">The Government are today confirming individual grant allocations to administering authorities for the Supporting People programme in 2007-08, which will fund housing-related support services for over1 million vulnerable people&mdash;including victims of domestic violence, teenage parents, older people and those with mental health problems&mdash;to help them to live independently in their accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">As part of the two-year local government funding settlement in December 2005, minimum allocations for 2007-08 were announced guaranteeing 95 per cent of the total available. Five per cent of the funding was held back pending consultation on the draft Supporting People distribution formula, with a commitment to confirming full Supporting People allocations for 2007-08 before the Summer Recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">The consultation on the Supporting People distribution formula is now complete and responses to this exercise have been assessed. Following consideration of the available options, a decision has been taken to target the remaining funding in 2007-08 to help to address some of the inherited uneven distribution of grant between authorities by increasing Supporting People funding to over half of all Supporting People local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">This decision is consistent with the approach taken to determining allocations in both 2005-06 and 2006-07, when an earlier version of the formula was used to inform the grant allocations to those authorities furthest from their correct relative share of the budget. Further work will be carried out on the analysis of responses to the consultation with a view to taking forward work on how we can distribute future funding based on need. All Supporting People grant allocations are listed below.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">The Government are also targeting funding from the Supporting People programme to assist linked programmes of national importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/7">This early announcement of funding for 2007-08 will help to provide the stability required by local authorities and the sector in order to plan for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Mr Liam Byrne)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">I would like to update the House on progress in deporting foreign national prisoners, following the Home Secretary's Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons; col. 77WS).</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">Our objective is that foreign national prisoners should face deportation and that deportation should happen as early as possible in their sentence. As an immediate step, we now have an imminent release team in IND working with HM Prison Service to ensure that foreign national prisoners who meet the existing criteria are not being released from prison without being considered for deportation. My review of the past few weeks confirms that, in order fully to achieve our objective, there is a need for legislation, as well as for fundamental reforms in the eight areas identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">First, the Home Secretary identified that there is today no unique identifier to link individuals who come in contact with the asylum, immigrationand criminal justice systems. We have therefore commenced development of a comprehensive approach to identity management across all Home Office areas and will finalise a strategic action plan by the end of September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/5">Secondly, we have identified that the police, Crown Prosecution Service, courts and prisons depend on self-declaration of nationality and that there is no requirement for the police to record the nationality of people brought into custody. There is no requirement in law for a detainee to furnish details of their identity or nationality. IND and the criminal justice agencies have now designed and tested proposals for newways of working, alongside options for new legal requirements to address this. We will conduct detailed field tests with front-line staff over the summer and produce recommendations in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/6">Thirdly, work has to be done to ensure that all future instructions are given to all agencies of the criminal justice, asylum and immigration systems and are both consistent and fully implemented. IND needs to work much more closely with the criminal justice agencies. Lin Homer has therefore joined the National Criminal Justice Board to ensure that this is done. Since <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase>, new guidance has been issued to IND and the Prison Service. Over the summer, we will audit related guidance of six key agencies, benchmark implementation and develop recommendations for change, including training provision, by October. This will be followed up by training and awareness events for staff working in the 20 key prisons, which process the largest numbers of foreign national prisoners at the earliest stages of their sentences, by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/7">Fourthly, the Home Secretary asked for an audit of policy criteria and processes and, fifthly, for steps to be taken to ensure that all deportation decisions are made according to the most robust interpretation of the requirements of our international obligations. Guidance in May to IND and prisons identified interim criteria, so that all non-EEA nationals sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment or more, either in one sentence or in two or three sentences over five years, and all EEA nationals sentenced to24 months or more, should be considered for deportation. We are changing the Immigration Rules with effect from midnight tonight to confirm the presumption that all such prisoners should be deported. The guidance also sets out that only rarely will factors other than international obligations weigh against deportation.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/8">But the current law does not go far enough to link criminality with deportation in the way that we would want and the public would expect. We need to change the law to make deportation the norm for foreign national prisoners, to remove some in-country rights of appeal, to streamline procedures and otherwise to remove barriers to deportation and removal, including existing exemptions for some Commonwealth nationals. We shall announce further steps in the wider IND review, to be published before the Recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/9">Sixthly, new formal arrangements are now in place to refer cases for consideration of deportation where the foreign national prisoner is in custody in Scotland or Northern Ireland. Prison authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland have confirmed that these processes are working well. These arrangements involve IND officials and officials in the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Prison Service, the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Prison Service. Agencies are now developing proposals to extend these formal arrangements for referral across the justice systems in these jurisdictions: for example, with the police, Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) and Scottish courts; and at each stage in the system in Northern Ireland, as approved by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/10">The seventh priority area for action is the sensitive issue of mentally disordered offenders, where there has hitherto been no established system of referral and nationality has not routinely been recorded. As with Scotland and Northern Ireland, arrangements have now been put in place to ensure that cases are referred for consideration of deportation for this particular group when their formal restriction is due to end. Home Office officials are considering with the Department of Health what other actions we might take to ensure that mentally disordered offenderscan be considered for deportation at the earliest appropriate opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/11">Finally, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is conducting targeted interviews with foreign national prisoners who qualify to transfer to serve their sentence in their home country. An urgent amendment is being sought to legislation currently before Parliament to remove the need for prisoner consent in these cases, and prisoner transfer agreements are being negotiated with more foreign Governments. We have agreements with 96 countries and territories. NOMS, IND and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are assembling a package of measures to accelerate this work further.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/12">There remains much to be done. Progress in all these areas will be reported in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.1/1">During the passage of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee D, 13/1/05; col. 130) and the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 7/2/05; col. 615) statements were made that certain powers available to the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO) would not be used in respect of tax offences until the outcome of the consideration of these powers by the current review of HM Revenue and Customs' powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/2">Those powers are contained in Part 2 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase>. They enable the director of RCPO (and prosecutors to whom he has delegated such powers) to serve disclosure notices, obtain material, conduct compulsory interviews and execute search warrants. These powers are powers of RCPO, not of HMRC; they are RCPO's to use. However, the prosecutor can authorise use of the powers by an officer of HMRC in respect of tax offences where the prosecutor has decided that such use is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/3">As the powers are for RCPO to use, the issue for the review of HMRC's powers to consider was the guidance that was available to HMRC staff when a prosecutor had authorised the use of the powers by an officer of HMRC. The review has looked atthat guidance and, following minor changes, has approved it.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/4">The Paymaster General and I agree that the powers contained in Part 2 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 are now available for use by RCPO in respect of tax offences.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/2">In July 2003, Alistair Darling, in response to the Orbit multi-modal study, confirmed his intention to add an extra lane of capacity to bring most of the remaining three-lane sections of the M25 up to four lanes in each direction. Construction work on this major investment project costing over &pound;2 billion is expected to start in 2008 and run through until 2016 with the widening being undertaken in stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/3">At the time of the decision to increase the capacity of the M25, it was made clear that widening wouldbe pursued alongside measures to improve the management of traffic flow in order to lock in the benefits that the additional capacity would provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/4">The department has been exploring how traffic management technology already being used on the motorway network might be used to control congestion on the orbital motorway and its junctions. But traffic using the motorway also uses surrounding local roads and not just the motorway. The modelling that has been completed shows that there is potentially considerable benefit to be gained inthe department applying and operating traffic management techniques jointly with local authorities. The benefits would be reflected in better overall journey times for the majority of road users across both the national and the local networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/5">It is vital that we harness local authorities' local knowledge at the planning stage, as well as developing a joint approach in applying that knowledge. I am therefore writing today to all the local authorities around the M25 to start this dialogue, focusing initially on those in the north-west segment, where the first section of widening will take place, with the aim of developing an approach that will ensure that long-distance traffic and local residents all benefit from this huge national investment.</p>
