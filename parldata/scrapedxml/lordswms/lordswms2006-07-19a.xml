	<p pid="a.90.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/2">I am pleased to announce progress on the complex weapons sector of the defence industrial strategy (DIS). This sector provides key missile development capabilities to our Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/3">The DIS identified that maintaining the industrial capability that we wished to retain onshore represented a substantial challenge given that we expect investment in new systems to decrease in the next five years from the current level due to a sharp decline in market size. We undertook to work with UK industry to meet this challenge and can now announce that we are forming a &quot;Team Complex Weapons&quot;. &quot;Team CW&quot; is led by MBDA and is centred around QinetiQ, Thales Air Defence Limited, Thales Missile Electronics and Roxel. &quot;Team CW&quot; will enable the UK to maintain key skills and technologies through a mixture of directed procurements and open competition, enabling controlled restructuring to take place while maintaining onshore access to the capabilities that our Armed Forces require.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/4">Together, we will develop &quot;Team CW&quot; during the second half of this year. We intend to agree a strategic partnering agreement in 2006. This will require contractually binding measures focused on business transformation both within the Ministry of Defence and within industry, allowing better-informed through-life decisions to be made and a more incremental approach to technology insertion to be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/5">We intend to use a range of programmesto incentivise the restructuring process. Most significantly, we have changed our procurement strategy for the loitering munition demonstration and manufacture programme, potentially worth more than &pound;500 million. It will be single-sourced to the MBDA-led &quot;Team CW&quot;, subject to an enduring requirement for this technology, to affordability and to the ability to clearly demonstrate value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/6">We are also announcing four contracts for the development of technologies to contribute to the enhancement of Storm Shadow, and the future anti-surface and future rapid effects programmes, which will offer significant opportunities for collaboration. In the support area, we have placed a contract for availability known as PROJECT RevISE, which covers air-launched weapons designed by MBDA.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/7">Our joint approach with industry will enable usto develop a globally competitive industry that will deliver the technologically advanced missiles that our Armed Forces will need in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.1/3">In the light of continued evidence of fraudulent Zimbabwean applications for indefinite leave to remain in the UK on grounds of UK ancestry lodged prior to <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-25">25 October 2004</phrase>, my predecessor made an authorisation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-16">16 January</phrase> of six months' duration under Section 19D of the Race Relations Act 1976. This authorisation enabled staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to subject these applications to more rigorous investigation than applications from persons of other nationalities, for the purpose of detecting fraudulent applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/4">As a result of our review of this authorisation, I have decided to renew it for a further six months. We will review the continued need for this authorisation before its expiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Mr Liam Byrne)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">I would like to update the House on progress in deporting foreign national prisoners, following the Home Secretary's Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons; col. 77WS).</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">Our objective is that foreign national prisoners should face deportation and that deportation should happen as early as possible in their sentence. As an immediate step, we now have an imminent release team in IND working with HM Prison Service to ensure that foreign national prisoners who meet the existing criteria are not being released from prison without being considered for deportation. My review of the past few weeks confirms that, in order fully to achieve our objective, there is a need for legislation, as well as for fundamental reforms in the eight areas identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">First, the Home Secretary identified that there is today no unique identifier to link individuals who come in contact with the asylum, immigrationand criminal justice systems. We have therefore commenced development of a comprehensive approach to identity management across all Home Office areas and will finalise a strategic action plan by the end of September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/5">Secondly, we have identified that the police, Crown Prosecution Service, courts and prisons depend on self-declaration of nationality and that there is no requirement for the police to record the nationality of people brought into custody. There is no requirement in law for a detainee to furnish details of their identity or nationality. IND and the criminal justice agencies have now designed and tested proposals for newways of working, alongside options for new legal requirements to address this. We will conduct detailed field tests with front-line staff over the summer and produce recommendations in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/6">Thirdly, work has to be done to ensure that all future instructions are given to all agencies of the criminal justice, asylum and immigration systems and are both consistent and fully implemented. IND needs to work much more closely with the criminal justice agencies. Lin Homer has therefore joined the National Criminal Justice Board to ensure that this is done. Since <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase>, new guidance has been issued to IND and the Prison Service. Over the summer, we will audit related guidance of six key agencies, benchmark implementation and develop recommendations for change, including training provision, by October. This will be followed up by training and awareness events for staff working in the 20 key prisons, which process the largest numbers of foreign national prisoners at the earliest stages of their sentences, by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/7">Fourthly, the Home Secretary asked for an audit of policy criteria and processes and, fifthly, for steps to be taken to ensure that all deportation decisions are made according to the most robust interpretation of the requirements of our international obligations. Guidance in May to IND and prisons identified interim criteria, so that all non-EEA nationals sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment or more, either in one sentence or in two or three sentences over five years, and all EEA nationals sentenced to24 months or more, should be considered for deportation. We are changing the Immigration Rules with effect from midnight tonight to confirm the presumption that all such prisoners should be deported. The guidance also sets out that only rarely will factors other than international obligations weigh against deportation.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/8">But the current law does not go far enough to link criminality with deportation in the way that we would want and the public would expect. We need to change the law to make deportation the norm for foreign national prisoners, to remove some in-country rights of appeal, to streamline procedures and otherwise to remove barriers to deportation and removal, including existing exemptions for some Commonwealth nationals. We shall announce further steps in the wider IND review, to be published before the Recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/9">Sixthly, new formal arrangements are now in place to refer cases for consideration of deportation where the foreign national prisoner is in custody in Scotland or Northern Ireland. Prison authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland have confirmed that these processes are working well. These arrangements involve IND officials and officials in the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Prison Service, the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Prison Service. Agencies are now developing proposals to extend these formal arrangements for referral across the justice systems in these jurisdictions: for example, with the police, Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) and Scottish courts; and at each stage in the system in Northern Ireland, as approved by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/10">The seventh priority area for action is the sensitive issue of mentally disordered offenders, where there has hitherto been no established system of referral and nationality has not routinely been recorded. As with Scotland and Northern Ireland, arrangements have now been put in place to ensure that cases are referred for consideration of deportation for this particular group when their formal restriction is due to end. Home Office officials are considering with the Department of Health what other actions we might take to ensure that mentally disordered offenderscan be considered for deportation at the earliest appropriate opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/11">Finally, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is conducting targeted interviews with foreign national prisoners who qualify to transfer to serve their sentence in their home country. An urgent amendment is being sought to legislation currently before Parliament to remove the need for prisoner consent in these cases, and prisoner transfer agreements are being negotiated with more foreign Governments. We have agreements with 96 countries and territories. NOMS, IND and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are assembling a package of measures to accelerate this work further.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/12">There remains much to be done. Progress in all these areas will be reported in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.1/1">During the passage of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee D, 13/1/05; col. 130) and the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 7/2/05; col. 615) statements were made that certain powers available to the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO) would not be used in respect of tax offences until the outcome of the consideration of these powers by the current review of HM Revenue and Customs' powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/2">Those powers are contained in Part 2 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase>. They enable the director of RCPO (and prosecutors to whom he has delegated such powers) to serve disclosure notices, obtain material, conduct compulsory interviews and execute search warrants. These powers are powers of RCPO, not of HMRC; they are RCPO's to use. However, the prosecutor can authorise use of the powers by an officer of HMRC in respect of tax offences where the prosecutor has decided that such use is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/3">As the powers are for RCPO to use, the issue for the review of HMRC's powers to consider was the guidance that was available to HMRC staff when a prosecutor had authorised the use of the powers by an officer of HMRC. The review has looked atthat guidance and, following minor changes, has approved it.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/4">The Paymaster General and I agree that the powers contained in Part 2 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 are now available for use by RCPO in respect of tax offences.</p>
