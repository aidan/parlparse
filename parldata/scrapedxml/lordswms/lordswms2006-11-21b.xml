	<p pid="b.21.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Derek Twigg) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/2">In May 2006, the then Veterans Minister announced that the Ministry of Defence would later this year be introducing an enhanced post-operational mental healthcare programme for recently-demobilised Reservists. He undertook to make a further announcement to confirm the details of the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/3">I am now pleased to be able to confirm that the programme, to be known as the Reservists Mental Health Programme (RMHP), will become operational with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-21">21 November 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/4">The programme is open to any current or former member of the UK Volunteer and Regular Reserves who has been demobilised since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> following an overseas operational deployment, and who believes that the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/5">An individual who thinks that they are eligible, and who would like an assessment, should ask their GP for a referral. This is the preferred method of contact, to ensure that both the GP and the RMHP assessors are kept aware of all the factors affecting the individual's health. Referrals from civilian psychiatric services are also accepted but the patient's GP is to be kept informed. In exceptional circumstances, individuals can contact the assessment centre directly. The programme is being co-ordinated by the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre (RTMC), Chilwell, Nottinghamshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/6">Eligible Reservists will be offered a mental health assessment. This will be conducted at the RTMC by appropriately qualified members of the Defence Medical Services (DMS). If an individual is assessed as having an operationally-related mental health problem that is amenable to treatment by the RMHP, then they will be offered out-patient treatment by the DMS. This will be available at one of MoD's 15 departments of community mental health in the UK, which will offer treatment in consultation with the individual's GP. The programme will be monitored in order to ensure that it meets the needs of demobilised reservists. The programme will run for an initial period of three years, at which point there will be a formal review to decide whether it should continue, or be modified.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/7">Further details of the programme are available at the RTMC website <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/rtmc/rmhp.htm">www.army.mod.uk/rtmc/rmhp.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.3/8">The Reserve Forces continue to make a vital contribution to the ongoing success of military operations. In return, we have a duty of care tothem, and this new programme is an important enhancement to the medical services that we provide.</p>

	<p pid="b.40.1/9">On the latter, I underlined the crucial importance of the reform process and the supporting role of the EU. I noted that some progress has been made since Hampton Court, but we now need to inject a sense of urgency. Links between business and HE are needed to ensure the right supply of skills and qualifications for the labour market and widening participation. To this end I proposed that a compendium of best practice in modernising universities should be drawn up on the back of the ongoing peer-learning activity between member states. This was supported by the Commission and many member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/10"><I>EIT</I></p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/11">Ministers gave a cautious welcome to the Commission's recent proposal. For the UK, I said the EIT's success would depend on its clarity of purpose. The focus on knowledge transfer is welcome. It is now crucial to ensure that the EIT provides value for money. We have concerns about the budget and want to be sure that resources will not be diverted from elsewhere. The Commission hopes that the regulation will be adopted by the end of 2007 and that two Knowledge and Innovation Communities would be up and running by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/12"><I>Vocational Education and Training</I></p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/13">The council adopted conclusions on enhancing European co-operation in vocational education and training (VET). These will encourage member states to develop strategies to raise skills levels and improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational training. The informal meeting of Education Ministerson4-<phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase> will pursue this theme. The Commission flagged up two forthcoming initiatives: a communication on adult learning; and a consultation on developing a European Credit Transfer System for VET.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/14"><I>Efficiency and Equity in Education and Training Systems</I></p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/15">The council also adopted conclusions on efficiency and equity in education and training systems. These will encourage member states to develop education policies which produce the best outcomes for all groups in society, including disadvantaged young people. The presidency inserted a reference to member states' exclusive responsibility for the organisation of the education systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/16"><I>European Qualifications Framework</I></p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/17">The council agreed a general approach on the draft recommendation on a European Qualifications Framework (EQF). The EQF will give a model for comparing qualifications in different member states and thereby support mobility.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/18"><I>AOB</I></p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/19">The presidency reported that the recommendations on education key competences and a mobility charter had been approved by the European Parliament. The French delegation presented a proposal for the development of a European teaching aid as an introduction to the history of the arts in Europe.</p>

We now intend to implement the main phase of the scheme in China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa and Zimbabwe. We are also considering the feasibility of introducing the scheme in a small number of further countries. A further Written Ministerial Statement will be made prior to any rollout of the scheme in countries additional to those listed above.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/3">Pre-entry screening of travellers should be seen as an integral part of our wider effort to combat TB in the UK. The UK also provides significant support for global TB control through a number of different channels, including support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and the STOPTB partnership as well as support for research on the development of new effective and affordable drugs. Her Majesty's Government also provide support to countries to build capacity in their health services to diagnose and treat all major causes of illness including TB.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.1/15">The change in the resource element of the DEL &pound;30,843,000 relates to the drawdown of end year flexibility &pound;42,270,000 of which &pound;13,100,000 is near cash resource, &pound;15,793,000 is non-cash and &pound;13,377,000 is capital. The department is also receiving a resource budget transfer of &pound;166,000 from the Cabinet Office. As DEL stated excludes depreciation, the change is adjusted by &pound;11,593,000 to &pound;30,843,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/16">The cash drawdown is in relation to additional resource requirement for various business areas within the department such as the PSNI, the NI Prison Service, the Public Prosecution Service and the Youth Justice Agency.

	<p pid="b.52.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State (Jim Knight) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/2">The Government Actuary has reported on the results of his valuation of the Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS) as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>. His report, which takes account of the reforms to the TPS that will be introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, including the increase in the contribution rate paid by teachers from 6 per cent to 6.4 per cent, recommends that, from that date, the employer contribution rate for the TPS should increase from the current rate of 13.5 per cent to14.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/3">The principal factor underlying the increase in the contribution rates relates to continuing improvements in life expectancy compared to the assumptions adopted in the previous valuation. The agreed package of TPS reforms will deliver savings on the employer contribution rate of some &pound;280 million a year compared to the contribution that would have been required if the existing scheme provisions had remained in place. This reform package, which includes an agreement on cost sharing between members and employers of any future changes in the contribution rate and a cap of 14 per cent on the employer rate from the 2008 scheme valuation onwards, should ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the TPS. A copy of the Government Actuary's report has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
