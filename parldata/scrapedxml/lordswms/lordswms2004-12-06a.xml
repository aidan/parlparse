	Home Office: Autumn Performance Report 2003
</major-heading>

	<p pid="a.45.1/1">The Home Office Autumn Performance Report 2003 has been published today by command of Her Majesty. Copies of the report are available in the Library. The report is also available on the Home Office website.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2">The report sets out the progress we have made towards achieving our public service agreement targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">The report shows we have made significant progress. Crime has fallen dramatically and people's fear is following suit. Police performance is improving and the justice gap is continuing to narrow. Our correctional services are operating effectively, we have expanded drug treatment and asylum is increasingly under control. Our work to increase race equality and community engagement is beginning to show real results: there are now 1.6 million more volunteers than in 2001, and more black and minority ethnic police officers than ever before.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.3/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has today placed in the Library of each House his response to the second annual report produced under Section 19E of the Race Relations Act 1976 by Mary Coussey, the independent race monitor, which was placed in the Library of both Houses in July. The race monitor has a statutory duty to report to Parliament via the Home Secretary on ministerial authorisations made under Section 19D of the Race Relations Act enabling immigration staff to discriminate on the basis of nationality or ethnic or national origin in the exercise of their functions.</p>

	Juvenile and Adult Offender Reconviction Rates
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-12-06a.45.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="45"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo041206/text/41206-17.htm#41206-17_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.45.5/1">The Home Office has today published two online national statistics reports on reconviction rates, which are the basis for measuring progress against its 2002 public service agreement target, to reduce reoffending for young offenders and for adult offenders by 5 per cent by 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/2">The results are:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/3">for juveniles, a reduction in reconvictions of 4.5 per cent for those dealt with in 2001 and 3.6 per cent for 2002, both as compared to 2000;</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/4">for adults, a 1.8 per cent reduction for those starting a community sentence or discharged from custody in 2001, compared to 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/5">Both of these are encouraging and demonstrate that we are on course to meet our PSA target.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.5/6">The juvenile report includes a correction of figures published in 2003 in Home Office Online Report 18/03. That report indicated that 2001 figures showed a 22.5 per cent reduction in reconvictions compared to 1997. As a result of an internal review of the methodology for calculating these figures, errors were identified and we commissioned an independent peer review, which confirmed the methodology used. The corrected figure for the fall in reconvictions between 1997 and 2001 is 7 per cent. Although lower than the previously published figure, this is nevertheless very significant progress.</p>

	Bosnia and Herzegovina: Export Licence Application
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-12-06a.46.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="46"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo041206/text/41206-17.htm#41206-18_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.46.1/1">In September 2004 the Government issued a licence for the export of ballistic body armour vests to the Ministry of Security in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ministry of Security requires the vests for the State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA). SIPA is responsible for, inter alia, diplomatic protection, which includes the British Embassy in Sarajevo as well as the missions of EU partners and other allies; tackling organised crime; and investigating war crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/2">An EU arms embargo has been in place against Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1996. The purpose of the embargo was to aid the establishment of peace and stability for the people of the region, taking into account in particular the need to ensure the safety of international troops and civilian personnel deployed. The embargo was amended in 1999 to exclude demining equipment and the transfer of small arms to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/3">We fully support the EU embargo. However, we are, in limited circumstances, prepared to make exemptions where denying an export would frustrate the purposes of the embargo. The UK has been active in encouraging Bosnia and Herzegovina to take greater responsibility for maintaining the rule of law and strengthening civilian policing. I am confident that granting this exception is fully consistent with this responsible approach of supporting the development of civilian policing while respecting the aims of the embargo.</p>

	Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-12-06a.49.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="49"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo041206/text/41206-17.htm#41206-18_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.49.3/1">Following interest in both Houses about the issues surrounding the safety of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), this Statement informs the House of the completion of the United Kingdom review of SSRIs and the publication today of the report. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) expert working group has now delivered comprehensive advice on the use of these drugs in children, young people and adults following a thorough review of all the evidence available. This gives parents, patients and those who treat depressive illnesses the information they need to make informed decisions about treatment of these potentially devastating conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/2">In 2003 an expert working group of the CSM was set up to consider further the safety of SSRIs, with particular reference to suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions. The expert group has examined all the evidence available from a wide range of sources, including a specific objective to listen to the patient viewpoint. The expert group has already reached conclusions on the use of SSRIs in children and the Government have published its findings. This latest report focuses on the use of SSRIs in adults. The work of this group is now complete and a comprehensive account of this work is being published today. In short, it concludes that:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/3" class="indent">there should be strengthened warnings on coming off SSRIs at the end of a course of treatment and how to minimise the risk of experiencing a withdrawal reaction;</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/4" class="indent">there should be specific advice on using the recommended dose of the SSRI because for the majority of SSRIs in depression, clinical trial data do not show an additional benefit above the lowest recommended dose;</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/5" class="indent">there should be clearer advice on what is known about the risk of suicide and suicidal behaviour&mdash;while clinical trial data cannot rule out a modest increase in the risk compared to placebo, there is now good evidence from large population studies that there is no clear increase in the risk of suicide in relation to SSRIs compared to other antidepressants;</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/6" class="indent">there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of self-harm and suicidal thoughts in young adults of 18 years or over. But individuals mature at different rates and young adults are at a higher background risk of suicidal behaviour than older adults, so as a precautionary measure young adults treated with SSRIs should be closely monitored. The expert group also recommended that in further research on the safety and efficacy of SSRIs young adults should be assessed separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/7">The CSM has also recommended that treatment with venlafaxine (Efexor) should only be initiated by specialists and that there should be in place arrangements for ongoing supervision of the patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/8">The report includes the key evidence on which the advice of the expert working group is based, including summaries of clinical trials submitted by companies at the MHRA's request. This unusual step demonstrates the MHRA's commitment to being as open as possible in drug regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/9">The report of the expert group is being published alongside guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) on depression and anxiety. In this way, the new advice of CSM can feed directly into clinical practice. Copies of the expert group's report and the NICE guidelines have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/10">Communications to patients and prescribers are taking place today and copies of these materials have also been placed in the Library. SSRIs are an important group of medicines, which help patients who suffer depressive illness. The health benefits of SSRIs in adults are still considered to outweigh the risk of adverse drug reactions. Patients currently taking venlafaxine should not stop taking their medicine but should consult their doctor for advice on treatment as should patients taking other SSRIs who are experiencing any side effects or are concerned about their treatment.</p>
