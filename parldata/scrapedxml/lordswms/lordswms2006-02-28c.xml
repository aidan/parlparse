	<p pid="c.9.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sports and Minister for Women (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.1/2">I am pleased to inform the House that today the Prime Minister received the final report of the Women and Work Commission, <i>Shaping a Fairer Future</i>. The Women and Work Commission was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-27">27 September 2004</phrase> as an independent taskforce, chaired by the Baroness Prosser, to make recommendations to the Government on tackling the pay and opportunities gap between men and women.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.1/3">The commission propose a wealth of practical ideas on how to close the gender pay and opportunities gap. These are founded on a thorough analysis of all the available evidence. The commission has described a complex problem which requires progress on a number of fronts. This is an imperative, not least because of the waste of women's skills and potential and the negative impact this has on the UK economy. We must also remove the unfair disadvantages women face, in our quest for social justice. The Government are determined to take action to address all causes of the pay gap highlighted in the report.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.1/4">Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House. Further announcements on specific actions will be made in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.9.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-21">21 February 2006</phrase>, the Football Association (FA) confirmed that the venue of the 2006 FA Cup final will be the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff rather than, as everyone had hoped, Wembley Stadium.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.3/3">Although Multiplex, the builders, is working hard to finish Wembley Stadium as quickly as possible, it is the FA's judgment that the risk that it may not be ready to host the final itself is just too great.

	<p pid="c.9.3/4">Wembley Stadium is a huge and complex project; it will be the best stadium in the world and a great piece of construction engineering.</p>

	<p pid="c.10.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Industry and the Regions (Alun Michael) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.3/2">I am today launching a consultation on a draft National Strategic Reference Framework for EU Structural Funds Programmes in the UK during the 2007&ndash;13 period. The national framework will establish the broad priorities for structural funds spending across the UK for this period.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.3/3">The European Council of 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-16">16 December 2005</phrase> reached agreement on the next EC budget, including future structural funds expenditure, for the 2007&ndash;13 financial perspective. As I explained in my Statement to Parliament of <phrase class="date" code="">20 December</phrase>, the UK will receive approximately &euro;9.4 billion (in 2004 prices) in structural funds from 2007 to 2013, including approximately &euro;2.6 billion in convergence funding for its poorest regions (Cornwall, west Wales and the Valleys and the Highlands and Islands); approximately &euro;6.2 billion in competitiveness funding for other regions; and approximately &euro;0.6 billion in co-operation funding for cross-border co-operation projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.3/4">The member states are now in the process of finalising a package of four structural funds regulations, which will establish the rules for delivering the funds during the 2007&ndash;13 budgetary cycle. Under the new regulations, each member state will be required to draw up a national strategic reference framework that establishes its broad priorities for structural funds spending, while demonstrating consistency with the EU's objectives for regional policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.3/5">The main purpose of this consultation is to invite comments from interested parties on the Government's draft framework. My department has developed the framework in close collaboration with other government departments with responsibility for structural funds and the Scottish Executive, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Administration. The framework provides an overview of the economic strengths and weaknesses of the UK's nations and regions, and puts forward a proposed approach to future structural funds spending across the UK. It includes a strong focus on activities to promote enterprise, innovation, sustainable communities, sustainable development, skills and employment, in support of the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.3/6">At the same time, the consultation invites comments on two related issues: the Government's proposals for distributing the UK's structural funds allocations under the new competitiveness objective and the administrative arrangements for delivering the funds in the UK during the 2007&ndash;13 budgetary cycle. The consultation begins on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase> and ends on <phrase class="date" code="">22 May 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.3/7">The Government will aim to publish a response to the consultation within three months following the close of the consultation. This will include a summary of responses, a statement of the Government's position on the issues raised and the final national strategic reference framework for the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.12.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.1/2">Between <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-01">1 September 2003</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-12">12 March 2004</phrase> the future role of Crombie study team carried out a comprehensive and objective examination of business processes, working practices and staffing levels within the Defence Munitions Centre (DMC) Crombie in Dunfermline West. The review was undertaken to distinguish between core and non-core activities for the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA) and the then Warship Support Agency in order to identify any areas of potential overlap, conflict or concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.1/3">The selected option entails structural and business changes at DMC Crombie, resulting in the reduction of 142 posts and the progressive removal of munitions-related tasks. The study team determined that the explosives storage capacity available at DMC Crombie is not required to meet the known and projected storage requirements of its customers. The team recommended the cessation or relocation of some non-core and all munitions processing tasks over a period of five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.1/4">Last year I decided, subject to TU consultation, to implement those recommendations. The consultation period has now finished and I have given final approval for the changes to be made.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.1/5">The recommendations will be implemented as quickly as possible so as to limit staff uncertainty. Major DMC Crombie customers will be made aware of the outcome of the study and will be given assurances that outputs will be maintained at the required levels both during and after implementation.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.1/6">Implementation will be phased with a planned reduction of 67 posts in the first year, and a further 75 posts between years 2006&ndash;07 to 2009&ndash;10. Every opportunity will be taken to reduce via natural wastage and voluntary retirement, but redundancies may still be necessary. A &quot;without commitment&quot; preference exercise will be carried out to identify volunteers for redundancy. Staff affected will be compensated under the terms of the principal Civil Service pension scheme and the services of the MoD Outplacement Service would be available to help those who may be made redundant to identify new opportunities as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="c.13.1/3">I am today placing in the Library of the House a copy of Mr. Randall's report <i>Collective Bargaining for a Modernised Workforce</i>. The report contains 38 recommendations and these are separately listed in the executive summary on pages three to eight. Members will be interested in these matters given the statutory basis of the PNB.</p>

	Probation Service: Murder of John Monckton

	<p pid="c.13.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/2">I am today placing in the Library the report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation into the tragic murder of John Monckton in Chelsea on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-29">29 November 2004</phrase>, which was committed by Damien Hanson and Elliot White. Both offenders were under the supervision of the London Probation Area at the time of the murder. I am grateful to the chief inspector for his rapid and thorough investigation in response to my request.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/3">The chief inspector describes a sustained and repeated failure on the part of the London Probation Area, over 2003 and 2004, to assess and manage these two offenders to a professional standard. He catalogues numerous ways in which the Probation Service's own national standards for the management of offenders were sidelined or ignored.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/4">The public has a right to expect that everything possible will be done to assess and manage the risk that dangerous offenders pose. Tragically that did not happen in the management of Hanson and White. The present Chief Officer of Probation in London has suspended four officers while a review is undertaken into their conduct in the handling of these cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/5">The chief inspector has reported that risk was not adequately assessed and then the systems in place to manage risk were not properly implemented. Some of this can be attributed to problems faced in London at the time, and which are now being addressed under a new chief officer who has been in post since April 2005. During this time London has moved from being the worst performing of all 42 probation areas in England and Wales, now to rank at number 28, and the improvements continue.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/6">The chief inspector has made four key recommendations addressed to the Government. I accept them all without reservation.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/7">He emphasises the importance of following approved procedures in the management of offenders. We shall be issuing guidelines to all probation areas drawing attention to the detailed practice recommendations made in his report.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/8">He points out the need for a clear lead responsibility for managing individual cases, and the need for effective management. I accept this entirely. We have already begun to introduce end-to-end offender management. Under this system every offender in the community will have a single, named offender manager, who will be responsible&mdash;and held accountable&mdash;for the way an offender is managed from beginning to end of sentence. In this way we will avoid the gaps and discontinuities which were such a serious feature of the way in which Hanson was managed.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/9">He proposes a clearer performance management framework for handling cases which pose a risk of harm to the public. His recommendation is well made and we will give the highest priority to performance management in these cases. In June we will be reporting publicly on our first year of a risk of harm improvement plan for all probation areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/10">He recommends that in exceptional cases of serious further offending by offenders under probation supervision, in addition to the internal review there should also be an independent investigation, and that its report should be published. I will implement this immediately. By this means I believe that we will continue to drive up performance and sustain public confidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/11">Additionally, the chief inspector recommends to the Parole Board that it puts in place arrangements to ensure proper liaison between the Probation Service and the board, when an offender's circumstances change between the decision to release and the actual release. The chairman of the Parole Board is content for me to say on behalf of the board that it accepts this recommendation, and will implement it as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/12">The public have a right to be protected from offenders who, like Damien Hanson, have repeatedly shown themselves to be ready to use violence to achieve their ends. We have already taken steps to ensure the public get that protection which underlies the Government's belief that dangerous and violent offenders should be let out of prison only if it is clear that they are no longer a risk to the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/13">Since April last year, when provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 were implemented, anyone who has committed a serious sexual or violent offence has been liable to be imprisoned for an indeterminate period. This means that such offenders will not be released into the community until the Parole Board assesses that it is safe to do so. In some cases, this may be never. We have introduced this sentence to make sure that the most dangerous offenders really do spend the whole of the rest of their life in prison&mdash;even if they do not have a life sentence. This was a significant change that is now being put into effect and has important implications for the future. I will be examining whether there are any means by which this approach can be applied to those who were convicted before last April.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/14">In addition to reforming the sentencing framework, we have also improved our system for assessing risk. OASys is internationally recognised as a world-class assessment tool and we will use this system to assess all offenders under the supervision of the probation and prison services. We have also consulted on plans for reforming probation services, and have committed to introducing a phased programme of contestability to ensure that services are provided by the best possible partnerships and providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/15">However, although I fully accept the chief inspector's recommendations and we have already improved our system for public protection, there is more we must do.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/16">That is why public protection is at the heart of the five-year prison and probation strategy I published earlier this month and is the highest priority of the new National Offender Management Service. The strategy sets out our commitment to:</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/17" class="indent">implement the new indeterminate sentence for public protection;</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/18" class="indent">keep up our excellent record on escapes from high-security prisons (with no escapes of category A prisoners since 1996);</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/19" class="indent">ensure better parole decisions, with the Parole Board putting the safety of the public first; and every released lifer living under the threat of recall to prison; and</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/20" class="indent">secure continuous improvement in the way offenders are supervised in the community, with better management of risk and offender managers working jointly with police, the Prison Service and others to supervise dangerous offenders.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/21">The commitments in the five-year strategy together with the recommendations of the chief inspector's report provide a firm basis for improving the ways in which we can best protect the public. However, in light of the chief inspector's report I intend to look again at the need for any further changes which may be necessary, including in relation to those convicted before the Criminal Justice Act 2003 came into effect. I will report my conclusions to the House by April and outline any further steps we intend to take.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/22">I conclude by expressing my deepest sympathy for Mrs Monckton and her family. All of us who followed the harrowing accounts of her husband's tragic murder could not fail to be touched by her and her young daughter's courage, and by the dignity which she has shown since.</p>

However, it would be wrong to rest upon these achievements while, for example, more than seven out of every 10 children in receipt of free school meals fail to achieve five or more good GCSEs.</p>
	<p pid="c.16.3/5">I am pleased, therefore, that the committee accepts the key building blocks of the White Paper. In particular, the report welcomes reforms on personalisation, on discipline and behaviour and on improving the quality of teaching and leadership through better professional development and ongoing workforce reform. The report makes a series of recommendations in relation to school admissions, trust schools and the role of the local authority, many of which I have accepted and which are reflected in the Education and Inspections Bill that will be introduced into the House of Commons today.</p>

	<p pid="c.17.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Alistair Darling) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.17.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase> my right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Trade and Industry and I wrote to Vice-President Jacques Barrot, Vice-President Gunter Verhuegen and Commissioner Stavros Dimas of the European Commission expressing the UK's support for the Commission review of the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) and to draw early attention to the potential expansion of the EU ETS to the surface transport sector. The letter asked that the inclusion of emissions from surface transport be considered as part of the review and offered our active contribution to work in this area. A copy of the letter is available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
