	Armed Forces: Gurkha Pensions
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-03-23a.27.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100844" speakername="Baroness Taylor of Bolton" colon=":" colnum="27"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90323-wms0001.htm#09032310000003">
	<p pid="a.27.1/1">My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State (Kevan Jones) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2">I am pleased to inform the House that with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> there will be an increase in pensions paid through the Gurkha pension scheme of 14.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/3">In addition, there will be significant increases of 20 per cent and more to some 1,000 pensioners who are 80 years or over. This increase is in line with the tripartite agreement which established a linkage between Indian Army pensions the Gurkhas pension scheme. This means the elderly who are the most vulnerable will get an overall increase of at least 34 per cent on their pensions, a significant proportion of which will be backdated to January 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/4">It has always been our policy to ensure that the 26,500 Gurkha pensioners mainly living in Nepal are treated fairly. The Gurkha pension scheme currently costs some &pound;47 million per year and it is calculated that these increases will add to the cost by a further &pound;7 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/5">This ensures that Gurkha pensions are kept at a fair and appropriate level and that the elderly who are the most vulnerable are helped. It demonstrates our continuing commitment to the retired Gurkha community in Nepal. This also reinforces the UK's long-standing links with the Government of Nepal which we greatly value and would wish to maintain.</p>

	Education: Adult Learning

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-03-23a.27.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100821" speakername="Lord Young of Norwood Green" colon=":" colnum="27"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90323-wms0001.htm#09032310000008">
	<p pid="a.27.3/1">Today my right honourable friend the Secretary of State Innovation, Universities and Skills (John Denham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/2">Today I am publishing <I>The Learning Revolution</I>, a White Paper on informal adult learning. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/3">The boom in book clubs, online research and blogging, together with the continuing popularity of museums, public lectures and adult education classes, all demonstrate that people in this country have a passion for learning. This informal adult learning can transform people's lives and makes a huge contribution to the well-being of the nation. It is a growing movement this Government are proud to foster and encourage.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/4">Our ambition is for every adult to be able to access and benefit from a wide choice of informal adult learning. But like many services and opportunities, some people find them easier to access than others. We recognise we can do more to ensure that inspiring opportunities are available in every community, accessible to everyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/5">The White Paper reaffirms the commitment to informal adult learning across government. It sets out how we will facilitate this by building capacity within individuals and communities and connecting the people who can make this happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.3/6">Government cannot do this alone. Our role is to be a catalyst for innovation and change. We will invest an additional &pound;30 million in 2009-10, from within DIUS existing baselines, to support the innovation we want to see. But it will take the continued efforts of all those who have been engaged with us to date, and many more, to continue the learning revolution.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Caroline Flint) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/2">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (David Miliband) and I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/3">The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/4"><I>General Affairs</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/5">Full details of A points adopted at the General Affairs Council can be found at <a href="http://www.consilium.europa">www.consilium.europa</a>. eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/106691.pdf.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/6"><I>European economic recovery plan</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/7">The council resumed discussion from the February GAERC of potential means of financing the Commission's proposals for energy and broadband infrastructure projects. The presidency put forward a compromise package, which I supported, on the condition that there would be no further changes to the energy project list, and that existing allocations for carbon capture and storage projects would be maintained. The presidency concluded that the European Council on 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-20">20 March</phrase> would need to return to the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/8">Preparation of the European Council, 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-20">20 March</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/9">The GAERC examined draft conclusions for the spring European Council (SEC), which cover the economic and financial situation; climate change and energy; and external relations, in particular the Eastern Partnership. The Government support the presidency's priorities for the SEC.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/10">On the economic and financial situation, there was broad support for the draft conclusions, although my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary noted the need to reflect the outcome of the G20 Finance Ministers' meeting over the weekend. On climate change, he underlined the European Council's commitment to setting out a position on climate financing at the SEC and called for more detailed language on possible options. He also requested European Council text on the EU budget review, calling on the Commission to publish its White Paper by the summer. He generally supported the energy part of the text.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/11">On external relations, my right honourable the Foreign Secretary noted plans for Foreign Ministers to discuss Afghanistan and Pakistan, and stressed the importance of a detailed debate on Pakistan, given the gravity of the situation there.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/12"><I>External Relations</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/13">The full text of council conclusions (including A points) can be accessed at <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/106692.pdf">www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/106692.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/14"><I>Western Balkans</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/15">Discussion focussed on Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/16">The council reviewed progress towards meeting the conditionality for closure of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) and concluded that it had not been met. Recalling its conclusions of November, the council urged BiH to engage with stronger determination on the necessary reform agenda and called on BiH's political leaders to refrain from nationalist rhetoric and actions. The council also reconfirmed its readiness for a transition from the OHR to increasing local ownership, supported by a reinforced EU presence, once the conditionality is met. It reviewed progress of EU preparations for this reinforced presence. The council also agreed to keep under review the possible evolution of EUFOR-ALTHEA (the EU's military operation in BiH) in light of political developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/17">The Foreign Secretary emphasised the importance of BiH meeting the conditionality for OHR closure and the need for the EU to remain firmly engaged in efforts to ensure that BiH political leaders took forward the necessary reform agenda. He welcomed the preparations for a future reinforced EU presence and underlined the importance of a strong mandate.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/18">Ministers also commended the efforts of Miroslav Lajc&aacute;k, the outgoing High Representative/EU Special Representative and welcomed the appointment of his successor, Valentin Inzko.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/19"><I>Belarus</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/20">Ministers agreed to renew the common position on Belarus, which is the legal basis for travel restrictions and an asset freeze for another 12 months, but suspend the travel restrictions (except on those who failed to investigate the &quot;disappearance&quot; of opposition activists in 1999 and 2000, and the chair of the Central Election Committee) for a further nine months. A review of Belarus's progress will take place at the end of the nine months, with the possibility either of reimposition of sanctions, or their complete lifting. The Government broadly welcome this decision which reflects the mixed progress made by Belarus to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/21">The council adopted conclusions that: confirmed the above decision; welcomed positive steps taken by Belarus following the council's decision on the temporary suspension of sanctions in October 2008; expressed concerns about the human rights situation and stressed that it was important for Belarus to address these.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/22"><I>Sudan/International Criminal Court</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/23">High Representative Solana stressed the extent of the humanitarian problems caused by the expulsion of the 13 international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the need to ensure the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) did not suffer as a result. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said that the EU needed to keep up the pressure on Sudan to reverse its decision; contacts with the African Union (AU) and the League of Arab States (LAS) were an important part of this; but we also needed to consider urgently what the consequences would be if our current precautionary measures failed and the NGOs were no longer able to operate in Sudan. We would need the AU and the LAS to step in to alleviate the situation; but we should also be aware that we could quickly find ourselves in a serious humanitarian crisis, extending well beyond Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/24">The council agreed conclusions, along the lines of UK proposals, recalling the presidency's declaration on behalf of the EU following the Government of Sudan's decision to expel 13 international humanitarian NGOs and revoke the licences of three local NGOs; and reiterating the presidency's call upon the Government of Sudan to reconsider their decision urgently, and ensure that humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people in Sudan be continuously guaranteed.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/25"><I>Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/26">Ministers took stock of the situation in Gaza, the inter-Palestinian talks and the formation of a new Israeli Government. The presidency, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner briefed Ministers on their recent contacts with partners in the region including their meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-15">15 March</phrase> with the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/27"><I>Transatlantic Relations</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/28">The presidency briefed on plans for the informal EU-US summit in Prague on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-05">5 April</phrase>. It envisaged that discussion would be organised around four main themes: climate change, the global economy, energy and foreign policy. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, with some support, called for Afghanistan to be the main focus of foreign policy discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/29"><I>AOB</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/30"><I>Information on the G8 presidency programme</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/31">Foreign Minister Frattini updated the council on the Italian G8 presidency priorities for the La Maddalena summit and G8 Foreign Ministers' meeting in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/32"><I>Sri Lanka</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/33">The Commission raised the deteriorating humanitarian situation; the Government of Sri Lanka had proposed evacuation passages in the remaining conflict area, but these had not been implemented and could not substitute for a ceasefire. They therefore urged the EU to hold a high-level troika with the Government of Sri Lanka and engage with India.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/34"><I>Durban Review Conference</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/35">There was an inconclusive discussion of the EU's approach to the Durban Review Conference, the follow-up to the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism, which will take place in Geneva in April. Negotiations are continuing in Geneva.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/36"><I>A points</I></p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/37">The council adopted a list of A points, in particular:</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/38">conclusions on EUFOR Chad/RCA, welcoming the successful conclusion of the mission;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/39">conclusions contributing to the SEC debate on development and climate change; and</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/40">conclusions on Afghanistan which: offer substantial financial assistance to the August 2009 elections, including an electoral observation mission (subject to conditions); reaffirm EU commitment to EUPOL and the rule of law, including significantly enhancing capacity building; look towards a single EU representative; agree the need for more and better assistance; highlight the important regional dimension and the EU's intention to play a greater role in supporting Pakistan, including through an ad hoc summit. The conclusions also welcome the visit of Vice-President Biden and look forward to co-operation with the US in a renewed commitment to Afghanistan and the region.</p>

	Food and Environment Research Agency
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-03-23a.31.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="31"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90323-wms0001.htm#09032310000054">
	<p pid="a.31.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/2">I am pleased to announce that the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) will vest on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> as an executive agency of Defra.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/3">Fera brings together the Central Science Laboratory (CSL), the UK Government Decontamination Service (GDS) the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI), Plant Varieties and Seeds Division (PVS) and Plant Health Division (PHD). It has a starting complement of 900 staff and will have an annual turnover of &pound;72 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/4">Fera's purpose is to provide robust evidence, rigorous analysis and professional advice, underpinned by world-class research, to help Defra, other government departments and other stakeholders support and develop a sustainable and secure food chain, a healthy natural environment and protect the global community from deliberate chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) or major accidental Hazard Material (HazMat) incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/5">As an executive agency of Defra, Fera plays an important role in helping to deliver the department's strategic priorities. These are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/6">secure a healthy natural environment for us all and deal with environmental risks;promote a sustainable, low-carbon and resource-efficient economy; andensure a thriving farming sector and a sustainable, healthy and secure food supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/7">It provides operational policy and regulation in support of these priorities, particularly in respect of plant and bee health, crop varieties and seeds. In addition, it undertakes and delivers high quality support and input into other regulatory issues relevant to its area of responsibility. Fera has responsibility to support government in responding to and recovering from emergency situations, by providing relevant capability, scientific evidence, analysis and advice. Including the GDS in Fera enables a wider breadth and coherence of service offering to government, and will enhance the national emergency response and recovery capability and UK Resilience. It will also strengthen the science capability underpinning GDS functions and areas of expertise.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/8">Fera also provides research and development, advice and services to other public and private sector organisations on a commercial basis. The agency will have a remit to develop wider market opportunities alongside its work for government. This will build on the skills that underpin its sustainable future and will maximize the value to the taxpayer of its unique knowledge and facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/9">Fera will work closely with other government departments and contribute to their PSAs. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/10">climate change (Department for Energy and Climate Change);regional economic performance (Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform); international poverty reduction and achieving MDGs (Department for International Development); counterterrorism (Home Office);safer communities (Home Office); innovation and skills (Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills);health and well-being (Department of Health);food safety, choice and healthy eating&mdash;support for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) strategic priorities; and environment, sustainability and rural affairs (Welsh Assembly Government).</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/11">The agency will continue CSL's established remit in supporting government and industry food security objectives. Through its scientific expertise Fera:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/12">is recognised both nationally and internationally in the areas of food chain safety and quality, and food security. It is part of a national network of laboratories specifically established to respond to CBRN incidents, which might include malicious/accidental food contamination, and has national status as the UK National Reference Laboratory for the FSA and Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) for specific chemical analyses in food including dioxins, mycotoxins, trace elements and pesticides;has a dedicated food safety and quality operation, which provides scientific capacity, capability and advice to underpin the food-related objectives of Defra, the FSA, Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD), VMD and other industry, and international stakeholders; andhas significant international influence with experts on European Food Safety Association (EFSA) panels, and is also heavily involved in European food research programmes. For example the agency is leading a major EU research project called TRACE on the traceability and authenticity of food. (More information at <a href="http://www.trace.eu.org/menu/project/">www.trace.eu.org/menu/project/</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/13">Fera will continue to deliver the business functions and services that have been provided by its constituent parts. For example it will provide the following services to the agricultural and horticultural industries:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/14">plant clinic services&mdash;global pest and disease identification services;LIAISON&mdash;contains information on registered agrochemical products for all UK crops;IENICA&mdash;Interactive European Network for Industrial Crops and their Applications;BeeBase&mdash;information for beekeepers;certification schemes for seeds and propagating material;registration and breeders' rights schemes for new plant varieties;proficiency testing schemes&mdash;Fera operates several schemes which provide the food, water, environment and plant health industries with assessments of the technical performance of their analysis laboratories.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/15">Details of all its services are available on Fera's website at <a href="http://services.csl.gov.uk/fera">http://services.csl.gov.uk/fera</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/16">In the short term stakeholders should not be affected by the formation of Fera and will receive the same professional services they currently enjoy. As the new agency develops I expect to see stakeholders benefit from improved services in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/17">stakeholders have access to a &quot;one-stop&quot; service in support of sustainable agriculture and food safety;scope for a more efficient and integrated approach to EU legislation, and therefore simpler, more cost-effective regulation;co-location of policy and scientific databases, improved risk assessment, more seamless transfer of diagnostic results through integration of databases resulting in more rapid management action, and better, faster disease control at lower cost;development of service provision in international consultancy, advice and training for the PVS and PHSI elements of the new agency as a result of greater critical mass and collaboration with CSL where expertise in these markets already exists; andmore cohesive approach to supporting and informing the central government approach to developing CBRN-related policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/18">Fera will operate under the net control accounting regime. As an on-vote agency, Fera will be included within the annual report and consolidated accounts for Defra. It will have an annual turnover of &pound;72 million. This includes the recently announced new funding for bee health of &pound;4.3 million. Fera will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and will produce its own annual report and accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/19">I have set the Food and Environment Research Agency the following performance targets for 2009-10:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/20"><I>Regulation, Policy and Risk</I></p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/21">To develop plant variety and seed, and plant and bee health policies in order to help achieve the Government's strategic priorities. To target activities, which reduce risks to commercial crop production and environment, assist trade facilitation and reduce regulatory burdens in accordance with Hampton principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/22"><I>Research and Assurance</I></p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/23">To deliver outputs from applied research and monitoring/ surveillance to deadline, which meet agreed quality standards and answer questions, and present them in a way that is useful to policy-makers and other delivery bodies. To convert research outputs into innovative products and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/24">To raise audit, risk management, security and quality standards and expectations. To deliver key outcomes against the 2006 science audit implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/25"><I>Response and Recovery</I></p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/26">To influence and deliver emergency response and recovery strategies and practical capability across the public sector, including ongoing assessment of supplier capability and capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/27"><I>Sustainability</I></p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/28">To consolidate the implementation of Fera, ensuring that stakeholders are fully informed of progress, and influence over and satisfaction levels for customers raised. To ensure that resources, including site accommodation and collaborative working, are maximised to best potential and meet benefits' realisation and sustainability targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/29">To recover the full economic costs of the agency's services from government departments, agencies and external customers, ensuring delivery of efficiency targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/30">Further details of Fera's role and responsibilities are given in its corporate documents: the framework document, the strategic direction and corporate plan 2009-10 to 2011-12, and the business plan 2009-10. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House and will be published on the agency's website at <a href="http://services.csl.gov.uk">http://services.csl.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement<b>.</b></p>
	<p pid="a.34.3/2">Following a 12-week consultation, which included hearing the views of a wide range of NHS and other stakeholders, I am today publishing final guidance on NHS patients who wish to pay for additional private care. The department received 146 consultation responses, and was pleased that many of these responses were broadly supportive of the recommendations of the Richards review and the aims of the guidance. The final version of the guidance addresses many of the practical issues raised by respondents, and will provide clarity for trusts and patients in the small number of cases where they choose to purchase additional private treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.3/3">Patients and the public can be confident that together with the package I set out in my oral Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-04">4 November 2008</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-11-04.131"><I>Official Report</I>, col. 131</phrase>) these measures will mean greater fairness and faster access to a wider range of more expensive drugs, reducing the need for patients to seek private care in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.3/4">The guidance and the response to the consultation has been placed in the Library and copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office.</p>

	Ports: Business Rates

	<p pid="a.35.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/2">Following the motion &quot;to regret that the Non-Domestic Rating (Collection and Enforcement) (Local Lists) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/204), laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-10">10 February</phrase>, will not prevent several port companies from becoming insolvent&quot;, the Government are placing their response on record.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3">A number of debates have taken place this year with reference to the occupiers of the properties affected by the ratings review of ports. The Government have listened carefully to the concerns put forward by the affected occupiers who, as a consequence of being separately assessed for rates from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, are in receipt of unexpected and significant backdated rate bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/4">In the current economic conditions, the Government have constantly emphasised that they are concerned about the impact of significant and unexpected backdated rates liability on businesses. The ratings system has to be fair and equitable to all, and there is not a legislative solution for waiving tax liability which does not confer a disadvantage among other rate payers who have paid the rates that are legally established and due.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/5">However, we believe, in the current economic circumstances that there is a general case to assist all businesses liable to receive large, unexpected backdated bills that have to be paid immediately, as is the case with a number of companies, including some port-based businesses across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/6">Following the Chancellor's announcement in the Pre-Budget Report, therefore, the Government have put in place an unprecedented scheme to help all businesses, which may include some occupiers of ports, to pay significant and unexpected backdated rates liabilities over a period of eight years.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/7">The Valuation Office Agency has also put in place special fast-track arrangements for rate payers with backdated bills who want to question or challenge their assessment following the ports review, and will give priority attention to these cases at all stages.</p>
