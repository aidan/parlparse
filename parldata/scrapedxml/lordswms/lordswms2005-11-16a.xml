	<p pid="a.83.1/4"><i>Capabilities</i> The council is expected to approve the requirements catalogue, which is part of the EU's headline goal 2010 capability process. The catalogue has used NATO-sourced operational analysis to identify the military capabilities and force requirements needed for the EU to fulfil its level of ambition. The council should also note the single progress report on military capabilities, and discuss progress on the battlegroups concept and the work of the European Defence Agency. As presidency, we aim to focus discussion on the identified need for rapidly deployable, highly interoperable capability and the importance of filling qualitative capability shortfalls.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/5"><i>Civil/military Co-ordination</i> The council will discuss progress on bringing together the EU's civilian and military instruments in a comprehensive approach to EU crisis management. Ministers are likely to note work on EU concepts for comprehensive planning and European security and defence policy (ESDP) support to security sector reform, and underline the need for these principles to be taken forward in future reviews and for planning for holistic EU engagement in particular regions.</p>

The council will review both the military mission Operation Althea, following its first year of operation, and the EU police mission (EUPM). It should agree the joint action to launch a follow-on mission to EUPM and is also expected to agree the joint action modifying the mandate of the EUSR in Bosnia to give him a greater role in co-ordinating EU instruments in the overall rule of law effort.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-16a.88.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="88"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51116-40.htm#51116-40_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.88.1/1">I wish to clarify the answer I gave in the House to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, on <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 10 November</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 720) regarding discussions with the Chinese over Zimbabwe. My right honourable friends the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary did encourage China to play a positive role on a range of international and regional issues that China could influence during President Hu's state visit to the UK but, I understand, did not specifically single out Zimbabwe during those discussions. However, we have raised our concerns about Zimbabwe with the Chinese Government at all levels, including through our embassy in Beijing, particularly on the issue of military assistance. Our ambassador to the UN has also raised Zimbabwe with his Chinese opposite number on several occasions, and has made clear our views in Security Council discussions, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-04">4 October 2005</phrase>. For those reasons, we believe President Hu will have known Zimbabwe is an important example of the general approach we have asked the Chinese Government to consider. I regret any ambiguity in my answer and have taken the earliest opportunity to clarify it.</p>
