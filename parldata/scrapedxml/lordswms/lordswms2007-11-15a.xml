<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-15a.45.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="45"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71115-wms0002.htm#07111528000219">
	<p pid="a.45.3/1">The Government have today laid before Parliament the document <I>Working Together to Cut Crime and Deliver Justice: A Strategic Plan for Criminal Justice 2008-11</I> (Cm 7247). This plan sets out how we will deliver the new justice for all public service agreement targets for the criminal justice system to improve efficiency and effectiveness in bringing offences to justice, especially serious offences; increase public confidence and victim and witness satisfaction; increase recovery of criminal assets; and improve enforcement of the orders of the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/2">The strategic plan sets out a new approach to the way in which the criminal justice agencies&mdash;police, prosecution, courts, probation, prison and youth justice services&mdash;will work together to improve efficiency and effectiveness in bringing offences to justice by giving local criminal justice boards greater flexibility to tailor their work to local priorities. The plan also sets out how the criminal justice system will support the Government's wider drive to make communities safer through reducing crime and reoffending, as detailed in the crime strategy, <I>Cutting Crime: A New Partnership 2008-11</I>, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/3">By working together more closely, staff in the criminal justice system have already successfully brought more offences to justice, improved services to victims and witnesses and built strong partnerships at national and local level to drive up performance, supported by modern technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/4">This plan builds on that success and sets out our commitment to a criminal justice system that:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/5">is effective in bringing offences to justice;engages the public and inspires confidence;puts the needs of victims at its heart; andhas simple and efficient processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/6">While we have made great strides in tackling volume crime, there is more to do to tackle some of the most serious crimes, such as sexual and violent crime, and to support the victims of these crimes. At the other end of the scale, we need to intervene earlier and more effectively with young people at risk, both victims and offenders. We need to continue our drive to tackle some of the most intractable problems&mdash;mental health, substance misuse and social exclusion&mdash;which underlie many crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/7">We recognise that it is crucial to engage the public more closely in the work of the criminal justice system. We need to bring the criminal justice system closer to the people whom it serves so that we inform them, consult them and tell them how we are responding to their views. Local criminal justice boards, working with local communities and crime and disorder reduction partnerships, will have a key role in achieving this. More needs to be done to ensure that the criminal justice system provides a service that is fair and effective for all sections of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/8">We will go further in improving the efficiency of every part of the system, making better use of the technology that is now in place, and give local areas the freedom to innovate and drive locally tailored programmes of change.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/9">The programmes of work that we set out in this plan will support this local approach. We are designing a blueprint for local leadership to enable local criminal justice boards to implement a co-ordinated programme of reform that is shared by all the criminal justice agencies and to engage effectively with local communities and local partners to tackle local priorities and reduce crime and reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/10">We have set ourselves a challenging target on asset recovery, sending a strong signal that crime does not pay. Offenders will be held to account for their actions and offered more opportunities to make amends to their victims and society. We will ensure that standards of service to victims and witnesses are embedded throughout the criminal justice system and that we respond to the needs of all victims, particularly the victims of the most serious crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/11">We will continue to drive improvements across the whole criminal justice process, but we will do so in a different way. At a national level, we will provide the framework and support, but improvements will be driven at local level, informed by local priorities. We will measure and respond to the views of local people about their local services. We will work in partnership with local community and voluntary organisations. We will build on what works to make a sustainable difference to reducing crime and reoffending in communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.1/1">Today my honourable friend the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education (Bill Rammell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:</p>

	<p pid="a.64.1/3"><I>Education</I></p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/4">Ministers are expected to reach political agreement on the proposed European qualifications framework, following amendments agreed with the European Parliament. These amendments are in line with the general approach that was agreed at a previous council.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.1/6">Ministers are expected to adopt resolutions on &quot;New skills for new jobs&quot; and on &quot;Education and training as a key driver of the Lisbon Strategy&quot;. These emphasise the importance of skills in the knowledge economy and the role of education and training in achieving the Lisbon goals. The education and skills contribution to the Lisbon agenda will be further discussed at an informal ministerial lunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/7">It is expected that a general approach will be agreed on the extension of the Erasmus Mundus higher education programme from 2009-14. The UK supports this text.

	<p pid="a.65.0/2">The deputy UK permanent representative, Anne Lambert, will attend the Youth Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-16">16 November</phrase>. The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/3">Ministers will be asked to adopt a resolution on implementing common objectives for voluntary activities of young people. The resolution reflects one of the thematic priorities of the ongoing Open Method of Co-ordination for youth and also contributes to the joint presidency priorities for 2007-08 of better social and professional integration of young people. The UK is broadly in favour of this document as it currently stands and particularly supports its emphasis on the positive contribution many young people make to society.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/4">Ministers are expected to agree conclusions on a transversal approach to youth policy. The conclusions call for a more cross-cutting, mainstreaming approach to youth policy across education and employment in the context of the Lisbon agenda. The UK supports this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/5">There will be an exchange of views on better consideration of youth issues in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy and implementing the European Youth Pact. The UK believes that the Youth Pact is best implemented through the national reform programmes and is anxious to avoid any additional burdens around youth-specific reporting.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.2/8"><I>Maritime Policy</I></p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/9">The Commission is expected to brief the council on maritime policy. The Government consider it important to maintain and promote the competitiveness of the EU maritime sector as part of the Lisbon agenda.</p>

Ministers are expected to reaffirm the commitment that they made at the October GAERC to consider, after recommendations from working groups, the further steps that the EU can take to support the agreed twin-track international approach to the Iranian nuclear issue. The Government believe that it is crucial that Iran complies with its international obligations and the twin-track approach is the best way to achieve this goal.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/23"><I>Iraq</I></p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/24">The council is expected to discuss EU engagement with Iraq.

The council is likely to adopt conclusions reaffirming its support for ongoing efforts by the troika to reach agreement on a status settlement in Kosovo and reiterating its support for High Representative Miroslav Lajcak in advancing key reforms in Bosnia. The Government fully support the efforts by the troika to find agreement, but will emphasise the importance of the EU being prepared to act in the event that agreement is not possible by December 10.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/27"><I>Georgia</I></p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/28">The council is expected to discuss recent events in Georgia.e The Government welcome this discussion, given the recent developments, including the declaration of a state of emergency by President Saakashvili in Georgia.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.2/36"><I>Operation EUFOR Althea (Bosnia-Herzegovina)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/37">The political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has deteriorated over the past year, leading the EU to postpone signature of BiH's stabilisation and association agreement (the first of many steps towards EU membership) in October 2007, following the collapse of police reform talks. The Government believe that the EU and the international community should continue to encourage leaders in Bosnia to exercise restraint and to continue to engage in dialogue with each other and with the High Representative.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/38">The council is expected to discuss EUFOR Althea, the EU military peacekeeping operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in light of these recent political developments. The Government support EUFOR remaining at current levels during this period of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/39"><I>Military Capabilities</I></p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/40">The council will be briefed on the headline goal progress catalogue. This represents the finalisation of four years' work from first instigation of the headline goal 2010 through the production of the requirements catalogue in 2005, the bidding stage in 2006 and finally the complex analysis of the shortfalls and risks that has been undertaken by the EU military staff and headline goal task force managed by successive presidencies. The Government want EU member states to focus on how to prioritise these shortfalls and decide where to invest resources. They will call for further consultation and co-operation with NATO and for work on improving the EU's intra-theatre transport capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/41">The High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, will present a paper identifying possible areas of improving EU military staff in early planning capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/42"><I>Development and Security</I></p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/43">The council will adopt conclusions on development and security in four areas: strategic planning, security sector reform, the EU-Africa partnership on security and development and humanitarian aid. The Government support the ongoing process in the EU to reinforce the security/development nexus. They will focus on ensuring delivery of an implementation plan and call for follow-up during successive presidencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.2/45">The council is expected to focus on the Africa-EU strategic partnership and action plans in advance of the EU-Africa summit on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase>. Ministers will discuss the consequences and impacts of the strategy on EU external action, on the basis of a presidency paper. The Government will push for agreement of the strategy and action plans and continue to push for action on millennium development goals, climate change and peace and security. We expect member states to be supportive of the strategic partnership and its goals, and to commit to implementation of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/46"><I>Towards an EU Response</I><I> to</I><I> Situations </I><I>of </I><I>Fragility</I></p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/47">The council will adopt conclusions on the development of an EU policy and improved practices on the situation of fragile states. The EU's response to fragile situations is critical, as fragile states pose a great challenge, both in terms of the achievement of the millennium development goals and in terms of global and regional security. The Government support the implementation of the measures proposed in the Commission's communication to increase co-ordination and coherence.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/48"><I>Policy </I><I>C</I><I>oherence for </I><I>D</I><I>evelopment</I></p>

The core of the Commission's strategy is to agree goods-only agreements this year ahead of the deadline on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase> before returning to services and other trade-related areas in the future. The Government want to ensure that EPAs deliver on their development potential. The Government will also want to make clear that the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries should not be bound to taking commitments on non-goods issues. It is their choice to negotiate on those elements.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/52"><I>Advancing Agriculture in Africa</I></p>
	<p pid="a.65.2/53">The council is expected to discuss the advancing African agriculture strategy proposal for continental and regional-level co-operation on agricultural development in Africa, which the Government support.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-15a.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100960" speakername="Lord Darzi of Denham" colon=":" colnum="73"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71115-wms0009.htm#07111528000912">
	<p pid="a.73.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">The independent sector is playing an important and increasing role within the NHS, providing high-quality treatment and choice for patients, and innovation, dynamism and contestability for existing National Health Service providers. Alongside the hard work of staff and in every organisation, the use of the independent sector is an integral part of our success in delivering dramatic falls in waiting times for patients. That is why we have taken a number of measures to make better use of the independent sector:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3">in the first wave of the independent sector treatment centre (ISTC) programme we established 23 fixed site ISTCs, a mobile ophthalmology service, a mobile MRI scanning service, a chlamydia screening service and six walk-in centres. This investment worth over &pound;1.4 billion has provided nearly 800,000 elective procedures, diagnostic assessments and episodes of primary care to NHS patients and is helping to reduce waiting times in those areas. I am today providing further information on each first-wave scheme, including the contract value, volume of activity, case mix by volume and utilisation rates, and in future these data will be published annually;there has been rapid growth in patients choosing to be referred to the 129 independent sector hospitals currently registered under the extended choice scheme. The value of activity has doubled in the last month alone. From April 2008, all patients referred for an elective procedure will be able to choose to go to any hospital in England which meets NHS standards and price. This already applies for orthopaedics and from December will cover general surgery, gynaecology and cardiology; and we are procuring additional GP services through the fairness in primary care initiative from a range of providers including the independent sector, and as announced last month we will be inviting bidders for further primary care contracts as we roll out new GP-led health centres and extra GP surgeries in deprived areas. In addition, we are offering primary care trusts the opportunity to use independent sector expertise in developing their commissioning function.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">As I said to the Health Select Committee in July, independent sector procurement will have to meet the local needse of patients and offer sound value for money for taxpayers. Where it meets these requirements we will increase the role of the independent sector in the provision of NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">Thee department has therefore undertaken a thorough revalidation of all the schemes currently being procured nationally through the ISTC programme to ensure they meet these objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/6">The director-general of the commercial directorate has advised that I proceed with the procurement of the following schemes:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/7">PET CT North Diagnostics (additional CT scans);PET CT South Diagnostics (additional CT scans);Renal (provision of dialysis treatment);Hampshire and Isle of Wight Electives (Southampton element);Greater Manchester (B) Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services;Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire Electives;Essex Electives;Hertfordshire Electives;Greater Manchester (A) Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services; andLondon North Electives.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/8">I am pleased to announce that three of these&mdash;PET CT North, PET CT South and the Renal scheme&mdash;have been approved to move to financial close. The department will conclude decisions on the remaining schemes no later than the end of March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/9">However, the director-general has concluded that the following schemes should not proceed as they were unlikely to provide acceptable value for money as the local NHS has successfully improved capacity to meet patients' needs. These are:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/10">North East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire Referral Assessment Diagnostics and Treatment Service;North East Diagnostics;South East Diagnostics;Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridge Electives;Cumbria and Lancashire Clinical Assessment and Treatment Service; and Hampshire and Isle of Wight Electives (Lymington element)</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/11">In addition, the director-general has advised that the contract with Care UK for the provision of diagnostic services in the West Midlands should be terminated because of an unacceptably low rate of use (5 per cent utilisation to date), and a very low prospect of the utilisation increasing which represents poor value for money to the taxpayer. In short, a significant increase in productivity by local NHS providers has substantially reduced the need for the capacity provided by this scheme with waiting times for most diagnostics reduced from more than one year to currently three weeks on average.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/12">The reduction in the overall size of the procurement does not represent a change in policy. As I have stated before, we will continue to use the independent sector. However, as I said to the Health Select Committee, we will now move towards greater local procurement of services. This will enable primary care trusts to take procurement decisions quickly on behalf of their patients rather than waiting for a prolonged process run from Whitehall. We believe that this will be a more effective route for increasing the quality of the role which the independent sector is able to provide in the NHS</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/13">To support this move I am announcing today the establishment of an independent sector procurement forum as a means for independent and third sector providers to advise the department on policies and practices related to local procurement of clinical services in order to ensure a level playing field. The forum will draw on a range of expertise and experience, including Ivan Bradbury of InHealth Netcare and Sir Ian Carruthers of the South West Strategic Health Authority. The forum will be advisory and act as a channel for the market to communicate and advise the department on PCT procurement policies and practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/14">We remain committed to choice, to empower patients and drive improvements in the quality of care. For choice to be truly effective, and for all providers to be able to compete fairly, it is essential that all patients are aware that they can now choose the hospital they are referred to. In the run-up to the start of free choice, we will raise public awareness of choice through, for example, NHS Choices and other means, as well as encouraging local providers to inform patients about the local choices available to them, and publishing a code of promotion to help guide them in this. To ensure fairness we will also:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/15">publish clear competition principles and simple rules for commissioners and providers to apply consistently for all those that provide services on behalf of the NHS, including social enterprise and third sector organisations as well as the independent sector; establish a competition panel to provide independent advice on competition issues to SHAs, which they would be expected to follow working closely with their PCTs. The panel will only consider issues where action to resolve issues have been exhausted; andseek to open up membership of the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts (CNST) to many non-NHS providers of NHS care.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/16">Our approach to the independent sector is pragmatic, not ideological. Where independent sector providers offer good value for money, innovation, and high-quality patient care, we will continue to bring them in to work as part of the family of NHS providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.3/1">My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
