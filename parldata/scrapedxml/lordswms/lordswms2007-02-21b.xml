	Care Services: New Deal for Carers
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-02-21b.87.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="87"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70221-wms0001.htm#07022174000007">
	<p pid="b.87.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/2">We have today launched the New Deal for Carers first signalled in the White Paper <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/3">The New Deal for Carers comprises four key elements. First, there will be a thorough review of the 1999 national strategy &quot;Caring for Carers&quot;. This pan-government review will provide the opportunity to set a new vision for the future, building on the foundations of the successes of the past 10 years which have included the right for carers to request flexible working, and the introduction of the carers grant. To support this, we have today announced the most far-reaching national consultation ever on the future of carers and in the coming months will invite carers' groups and the voluntary sector to help us design a modern vision for caring.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/4">Underpinning the development of the new strategic vision will be a series of practical measures, based on what carers themselves have said will be the next steps forward in meeting their support needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/5">The Government will be launching an expert carers programme. This programme will equip carers with advocacy skills and provide practical training such as first aid, and moving and handling. The Government are working closely with the leading organisations representing carers to ensure that the content of the expert carers programme reflect carers' own needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/6">The Government will also be launching a helpline for carers. The 1999 strategy emphasised the importance of good information for carers and the helpline will now provide a single telephone number to provide comprehensive information, ranging from national rights and entitlements through to what is available in an individual's own locality.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/7">Finally, the Government are making an additional &pound;25 million available to local authorities in England to enhance the provision of short-term, home-based respite care. There is considerable evidence that the lack of proper planned alternative care provision in the event of something untoward happening is one of the most important factors in limiting a carer's freedom to have a life of their own. The Government are working with stakeholders to develop guidelines to local authorities on the provision of such emergency respite care. This guidance will be published this summer and &pound;25 million will be made available to English local authorities from October 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.3/56">The Department for Transport did not present a winter supplementary estimate in 2006-07. Consequently, its potential drawdown of cash is limited to the net cash requirement presented to Parliament in the main estimate (&pound;11,199,801,000). On latest forecasts, it is expected to reach that limit before the end of February 2007. As the Consolidated Fund Bill, enacting the spring supplementary estimate, is not due to be passed until mid-March, the department needs access to the Contingencies Fund to maintain spending on transport programmes. The amount it is seeking is not the full difference between the main estimate net cash requirement and the spring supplementary estimate net cash requirement, and it will be repaid in full once the Consolidated Fund Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.3/57">The department is obtaining the appropriate estimate cover to repay the advance during the spring supplementary estimates. Parliamentary approval for additional resources of &pound;533,764,000 will be sought in the spring supplementary estimate for the Department for Transport. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at &pound;300,000,000 will be met by repayable cash advances from the Contingencies Fund.</p>

	Health: Professional Regulation
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-02-21b.87.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="87"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70221-wms0001.htm#07022174000088">
	<p pid="b.87.5/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/2">The Government have today laid before Parliament a White Paper on professional regulation (Cm 7013), together with our response to the Fifth Report of the Shipman Inquiry and the related inquiries into Richard Neale, Clifford Ayling, Michael Haslam and William Kerr (Cm 7015). The Government are also publishing today a report which brings together all the action that the Government have taken in response to the six reports that the inquiry published (Cm 7014). Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/3">The Government are very grateful to the chairs of the four inquiries&mdash;Lady Justice Smith, Dame Anna Pauffley, Suzan Matthews, and Nigel Pleming&mdash;and to all those who contributed to their painstaking and thorough deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/4">Their findings were shocking to patients, the public and professionals themselves. The case of Harold Shipman, the trusted GP who murdered as many as 250 of his patients, is well known. Ayling, Kerr and Haslam sexually abused patients with impunity over many years. Neale's incompetent surgery continued in the United Kingdom although he had already been struck off in Canada.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/5">Even so, people still rightly hold the health professions in the very highest regard and take it for granted that they deliver excellent care as a matter of routine. It is therefore all the more bewildering when that trust is betrayed.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/6">The two documents set out a programme of action on two fronts to ensure that public and professional confidence is sustained. The White Paper sets out measures to strengthen professional regulation. The response to the Shipman inquiry proposes a series of measures to strengthen clinical governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/7">The White Paper will ensure that the regulators command the full confidence of both the public and the professions. In future, members of the regulatory councils will be independently appointed, rather than elected; professional members will no longer form a majority on councils; and the accountability of councils to Parliament will be enhanced.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/8">To ensure that all health professionals are safe to practise with their patients, new revalidation arrangements will require them to demonstrate periodically that they have kept up to date. We will introduce in England a system of regional GMC affiliates who will provide support to local employers in acting on concerns about doctors and ensure that their revalidation is carried out rigorously. The arrangements will be piloted, in consultation with the professions and employers, to avoid bureaucracy and ensure that they are proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/9">In adjudicating on fitness to practise cases, all regulators will adopt the civil standard of proof, with a sliding scale. The adjudication function of the GMC will be made fully independent, to provide further assurance to patients and professionals. Other professions will continue to conduct adjudication panels, but members of those panels will be independently appointed.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/10">As the pharmacy profession undergoes a revolution in its capacity to treat patients, my department will work with the pharmacy profession to establish a General Pharmaceutical Council to regulate pharmacy and agree effective arrangements for the clinical leadership of the profession.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/11">As the Shipman inquiry acknowledged, the NHS has made much progress since the inquiries were established. In particular, new structures and processes to ensure the quality of care, known as &quot;clinical governance&quot;, have put in place systems which will help prevent such abuses continuing undetected again. Further safeguards are needed. This will mean improved support for patients who want to register concerns and measures to ensure they are taken seriously; making more systematic use of information about the clinical outcomes of individual practitioners and teams; ensuring information from different sources is brought together so that a fuller picture about professionals is properly considered and robust action is taken; ensuring more rigorous checks on references and qualifications when health professionals are recruited; providing comprehensive guidance on preventing transgressions of professional boundaries and sexual behaviour with patients; and requiring all primary care organisations to adopt best practice in investigating and acting on concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/12">The department will consult shortly on proposals for a radical overhaul of the processes for death certification. These will ensure a unified system of death certification that provides more effective scrutiny and stronger safeguards for the public. I am also publishing today a report which brings together all the action that the Government have taken in response to the six reports that the inquiry published.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/13">In consultation, all the regulators have acknowledged the need for further reform. The GMC in particular is to be commended for its thoughtful and progressive stance and I congratulate Sir Graeme Catto and the council on the leadership they have shown.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.5/14">The proposals offer the opportunity for a lasting settlement in the relationship between society and the health professions. Many aspects will require legislation, which we will bring forward as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.7/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">My honourable friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Tony McNulty)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.7/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase> last year I announced that I had established a review of police pay arrangements and that I had asked Sir Clive Booth to undertake part one of this review, focusing on the arrangements for determining police officer pay for 2007 and reporting early in the new year. I have now received Sir Clive Booth's report entitled <I>Fair Pay for Police Officers</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.7/3">I am grateful to Sir Clive for undertaking this work. Effective pay arrangements for police officers are essential for a modern police service which delivers high standards of community safety and security to the public. The report makes a number of recommendations and I shall be considering them very carefully and consulting policing stakeholders on them. The method for determining police officer pay for 2007 will then be progressed through the Police Negotiating Board, before the Home Secretary takes his final decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.7/4">I have today placed a copy of Sir Clive Booth's report in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.7/5">The second part of the review will begin shortly. This part of the review will review the effectiveness of the negotiating machinery for the police and make recommendations on how police pay and other conditions of service should be determined. This will include consideration of the option of a pay review body and the impact of any proposal for determining police officer pay on the negotiation machinery. I have asked Sir Clive Booth to undertake this part of the review also and am pleased to announce that he has accepted. Sir Clive will report to me in the autumn of this year.</p>
