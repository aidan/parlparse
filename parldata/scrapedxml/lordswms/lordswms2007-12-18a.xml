	<p pid="a.97.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Competitiveness (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/2">Tomorrow my department is publishing a formal response to the consultation on how government departments, regional development agencies, local authorities and non-departmental public bodies should support business in the future. This looks not just at the support my department provides, but much more broadly across the whole of government at a national, regional and local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/3">The formal response document builds on the initial government response to the Simplifying Business Support consultation. It summarises responses received and provides further information on the future, shared framework for publicly funded business support we are developing in the light of evidence and consultation feedback. This shared framework will enable government and the broader public sector to implement our vision for business support in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/4">It sets out the principles for making the delivery of business support more efficient and builds on decisions taken in the light of economic analysis and the consultation on Simplifying Business Support on access to business support and business support interventions referred to in paragraphs 4.43 to 4.46 of the Pre-Budget Report. Business Link will continue to be developed as the primary publicly funded access channel to business support. In the spirit of simplification, Business Link will aim to build on best practice partnership working with local authorities, business support providers, business membership organisations and other key partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/5">We are also publishing an early stage impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/6">We have consulted businesses, including social enterprises, business representatives, local authorities, organisations that support business and other interested parties. The consultation ran from <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-14">14 September</phrase>. Copies of the response to the consultation document will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-19">19 December 2007</phrase> and the document will be on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/consultations/index">www.dti.gov.uk/consultations/index</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase> I announced to the House the five unitary proposals that the Secretary of State had decided to implement without modification, having considered all the information and representations available to her.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/3">In the case of the unitary proposals for Cheshire, I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December</phrase> that there remained alternative proposals for the whole area concerned which, as I confirmed to the House in July, we judged reasonably likely to achieve the outcomes specified in the five criteria. I assured the House at the time that we would make final decisions as soon as we could.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/4">Having now considered all the information and representations available to her, including the very large volume of additional material that she has received since July, the Secretary of State remains of the view that there is a reasonable likelihood that, if implemented, both proposals would meet the outcomes specified by each of the criteria set out in the invitation of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-26">26 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/5">Overall, she has decided that it is more likely that the long-term outcomes around strategic leadership, neighbourhood empowerment and value for money and equity on public services would be delivered to the greater extent by the proposal for a two-unitary Cheshire. This is the process that we set out in the consultation document <I>Means of Prioritising Proposals</I> issued in June 2007. She has therefore decided to confirm her earlier &quot;minded to&quot; decision, and accordingly intends to implement the proposal for two unitary authorities in Cheshire by order made under Section 7 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/6">It is now for all the councils in Cheshire, their members and employees, to work constructively and imaginatively together to deliver two new unitary councils that will achieve their full potential for local residents. Local people will rightly expect nothing less than their successful delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/7">In the case of the unitary proposals from Bedford Borough Council and Bedfordshire County Council, I confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December</phrase> that, on the basis of the information then available to her, the Secretary of State remained minded to implement Bedford Borough Council's proposal subject to there being a satisfactory proposal for the rest of the county area. I notified the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November</phrase> that the Secretary of State had invited the other councils in Bedfordshire by <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-17">17 December</phrase> to make proposals for future unitary local government structures in the remainder of the county area.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/8">We have now received a response to this further invitation from the remaining district councils in Bedfordshire&mdash;Mid and South Bedfordshire District Councils. In accordance with Section 7(3) of the 2007 Act, we will tomorrow be launching a consultation seeking the views of partners and stakeholders in the areas affected by the proposals for Bedfordshire. Partners and stakeholders include all local authorities, the wider public sector, the business community, and the voluntary and community sector. It will, however, be open to anyone to respond to the consultation document that we are issuing, copies of which will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/9">After the stakeholder consultation, we will consider very carefully all the representations that we have received. Any proposal or proposals will proceed to implementation if, and only if, when we take our final decisions, we remain satisfied that they meet all the criteria set out in the invitation.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Kim Howells) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/2">The Government are committed to informing Parliament annually of the sanctions regimes that the United Kingdom implements. Currently the United Kingdom implements United Nations sanctions in relation to al-Qaeda and the Taliban, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan and terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/3">The UK also implements sanctions regimes imposed autonomously by the EU in relation to Belarus, Burma, China, the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (in connection with individuals indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia or responsible for certain acts of violence at Mostar), Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/4">In accordance with a decision of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the United Kingdom implements arms embargoes on Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Government also take full account of the Economic Community of West African States moratorium on certain exports of small arms and light weapons to Economic Community of West African States members.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/5">A full list of sanctions regimes and restrictive measures implemented by the UK is published on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/sanctions">www.fco.gov.uk/sanctions</a>. Following a request from the right honourable Lord Wakeham during the <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-12">12 October</phrase> Lords debate on the impact of economic sanctions, this document now includes objectives and lift criteria for each regime.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.1/1">Today my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills (John Denham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">I am drawing the attention of the House to a factual error of reporting in relation to the number of employers who have voluntarily made the Skills Pledge to support the upskilling of their employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-12">12 December 2007</phrase> the House was informed by David Lammy, Minister for Skills within Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, that the number of employees covered by the voluntary pledge was 3.1 million, based on information from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). Incorrect figures were used in a small number of other instances in reply to Members' Questions and in another place. However, I was informed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-14">Friday 14 December</phrase> by the LSC that the correct figure is 2.3 million and that the mistake was due to a computer programming error which has now been detected and rectified. The LSC has confirmed that the number of employers making the skills pledge (630) was correct. I apologise to the House unreservedly for this inadvertent error. I am also writing to members who were given the incorrect figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">The LSC's internal quality assurance processes identified this programming error. However, I have asked the LSC chief executive to ensure through a rigorous review of his organisation's information and reporting systems that there is no recurrence of this problem. This review will report to me in January 2008 as part on my ongoing considerations on the future leadership and management of the Skills Pledge and its contribution to making the skills of the workforce world class.</p>
