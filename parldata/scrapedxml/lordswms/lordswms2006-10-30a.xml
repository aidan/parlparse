	<p pid="a.2.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Employment and Welfare Reform (Jim Murphy) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/2">Today, I am pleased to announce that Jobcentre Plus is to introduce enhanced services across the country for people who wish to apply for working age benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/3">In response to feedback from customers, staff and key stakeholders, Jobcentre Plus has been testing improved services in parts of North Lincolnshire since <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-27">27 February 2006</phrase> and parts of London since <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April</phrase> specifically designed to improve the customer's experience when applying for working age benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/4">These changes have proven effective and have been well received in the pilot area. Therefore in the early part of 2007 Jobcentre Plus will start to introduce the following improvements nationally:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/5">the introduction of a 0800 telephone number for all people making new claims to working age benefits. Currently the initial call to an 0845 number is made at the customer's expense;customers will need to have only one telephone conversation with a contact centre adviser to make their application. Currently there are two;we will introduce fast-track procedures for people making repeat claims and for people who do not require an immediate work-focused interview; andfaster access to improved information and advice to help customers access the service they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/6">These enhancements, along with administrative changes, will improve and simplify the service we offer to our customers and provide speedier access to the help they need to get into work as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June</phrase> I was pleased to announce new funding of &pound;27million spread over three years for children's hospice services. Applications for the Children's Hospice and Children's Hospice at Home Grant have now been considered by a group which included key stakeholders and I am pleased to announce that 35 hospice services successfully applied for grants and will benefit from this funding. The payments will be made as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3">At the same time as announcing this grant I announced a review of children's hospice services and subsequently announced in a Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-18">18 September</phrase> that the review had been extended to consider the long term sustainability of children's palliative care services and funding more generally. I am pleased to announce that Professor Sir Alan Craft and Ms Sue Killen have agreed to lead this important review. The consultation phase of this review commenced in October and contributions are being sought. Contact can be made with the review team at childpalliativecare@dh.gsi.gov.uk. I expect the review to be completed by spring 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr Kim Howells) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/2">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-14">14 October 2006</phrase> unanimously adopted UNSCR 1718 (2006) under Chapter VII of the UN charter. The Security Council's rapid and decisive action, in response to DPRK's nuclear test on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October</phrase>, sends a strong signal to the DPRK Government that the international community will not tolerate their irresponsible and provocative actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/3">The resolution is targeted at stopping the DPRK's WMD and missile programmes and changing the behaviour of the regime in Pyongyang. We now expect the DPRK to comply with the resolution and return to the six-party talks without pre-conditions. If it does comply fully with the resolution's provisions and if the talks resume successfully, the UK would expect the Security Council to lift the measures imposed by the resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/4">The resolution backs these demands by imposing sanctions against the DPRK. All states have a legal obligation to comply. The individual sanctions comprise an assets freeze and travel ban on individuals and entities involved in or supporting DPRK's nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes; a ban on making funds available to those individuals and entities; a ban on the export or supply of certain substantial military items, nuclear materials, missiles and sensitive technologies; the export of luxury goods; the provision of any technical assistance, training or other advice in relation to the military or nuclear/ballistic-missile items and the procurement of any of the sensitive items so that DPRK cannot export proliferation-sensitive technologies to other countries. The resolution also includes a provision calling on states to inspect cargo going to and from DPRK subject to action being in conformity with international law and member states' own national laws, where such action is necessary to prevent illicit trafficking in prohibited goods and materials.</p>
