	Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting: Uganda
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27c.139.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="139"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0001.htm#07112756000015">
	<p pid="c.139.1/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister (Mr Gordon Brown) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/2">The biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM) took place in Kampala, from 23 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-25">25 November</phrase>. Her Majesty the Queen attended the meeting in her role as head of the Commonwealth. This was Her Majesty the Queen's 18th CHOGM, and I&mdash;like my fellow Commonwealth leaders&mdash;pay tribute to her dedication and commitment to the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/3">The meeting came at a critical moment: in the midst of the democratic crisis in Pakistan; one week before the Bali climate change conference with only 10 to 15 years to turn the tide on global warming; half way to the millennium development goals which the world is in danger of not meeting; with months left to agree a global trade deal; and with no room for complacency in the fight against extremism.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/4">And as a unique partnership of rich and poor countries, the Commonwealth has a critical role to play in meeting these challenges.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/5">Commonwealth leaders met in the aftermath of President Musharrafs decision on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-03">3 November</phrase> to declare a state of emergency. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">12 November</phrase> the Commonwealth Ministers' Action Group (CMAG) set out five conditions for Pakistan to fulfil in order to avoid suspension from the Commonwealth: lifting the state of emergency; the president giving up his job as chief of staff of the army; holding free and fair elections; releasing political detainees incarcerated during the emergency; and removing restrictions on the freedom of the press. Meeting in Kampala on the eve of CHOGM, CMAG concluded that whilst progress had been made&mdash;not least the commitment to an election that has been announced for <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-08">8 January</phrase>&mdash;the five conditions had not been met and, crucially, the state of emergency was still in place. Therefore Pakistan was suspended from the Councils of the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/6">The CHOGM and the UK made it clear that we hope to see Pakistan restored to the Commonwealth as soon as possible and will revisit the suspension in January once the election has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/7">The Commonwealth has sent the strongest signal that, above all, it stands for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/8">The meeting also agreed with the need to act collectively to:</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/9">redouble its efforts to deliver education for all, with a particular focus on enrolling the 30 million primary-school-aged children out of school across the Commonwealth; eliminating gender disparity in education; and strengthening education systems in countries affected by conflict. At Britain's initiative, heads also undertook to put in place, by the end of 2008, at least 20 long-term education plans of the type endorsed by the education for all fast-track initiative, and to focus on measuring and improving the quality of education;achieve a successful conclusion to the WTO's negotiations, in light of the fundamental contribution of international trade to global prosperity, sustainable development and to the elimination of poverty;establish a small group of Commonwealth heads to campaign for reform of international institutions, in order to achieve an architecture which reflects today's global challenges and is more effective and more representative;meet the millennium development goals&mdash;the responsibility of all countries rich and poor&mdash;and called for a UN meeting next year to re-energise global efforts; and,achieve a declaration on climate change, as we move towards the Bali summit, by calling for a long-term global goal for emissions reduction to which all countries must contribute&mdash;a comprehensive post-2012 global agreement that strengthens, broadens and deepens current arrangements and leads to reduced emissions of global greenhouse gases. We agreed on the need for all Commonwealth members to assess the implications of climate change for their societies, and offered new technical assistance through the Commonwealth to help achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/10">CHOGM also endorsed the analysis by the Commission on Respect and Understanding led by Nobel prize-winner Amartya Sen on how to promote respect and understanding among different ethnic and faith groups. The meeting recognised that all countries must work together to tackle the causes of radicalisation and noted that the diversity of its members gives the Commonwealth a unique perspective on these issues. Heads of Government committed to developing concrete activities to give practical effect to the Commission's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/11">We also applauded the work of Don McKinnon, outgoing Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, who has led the organisation with energy and creativity and welcomed his successor, Mr Sharma.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/12">I am confident that, following the Kampala CHOGM, the Commonwealth can continue to play a vital role in international affairs.</p>
	<p pid="c.139.1/13">Copies of the concluding communiqu&eacute; have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	ContactPoint
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27c.140.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="140"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0001.htm#07112756000027">
	<p pid="c.140.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families (Kevin Brennan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/2">I am announcing today levels of funding to local authorities to support the implementation of ContactPoint and providing an update on the implementation timetable.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/3">Some &pound;40 million will be made available to support local implementation until March 2009, made up of the following elements:</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/4">&pound;27 million to local authorities in England, from April 2008 to March 2009, to support implementation;&pound;1 million from April 2008 to March 2009 to support national partners' ContactPoint implementation projects; anda further &pound;12 million from January 2008, made available to lead organisations to support modifications to case management systems. This will enable the main existing systems to provide data to ContactPoint and/or for authorised users to be able to have one-way access to ContactPoint via those systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/5">We have also provided indicative funding allocations to local authorities for future years: &pound;27 million in 2009-10 and &pound;15 million in 2010-11. My officials will write to local authorities and national partners today to inform local authorities and other partners about this funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/6">ContactPoint is a key element of the <I>Every Child Matters</I> programme to transform children's services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. ContactPoint will provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/7">ContactPoint will be a simple basic online tool containing:</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/8">minimal identifying information for each child; name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details for parents or carers. Each child will also have a unique identifying number;contact details for the child's educational setting and GP practice and for other practitioners or services working with them; andan indication as to whether a service or practitioner holds an assessment under the common assessment framework or whether they are a lead professional for that child.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/9">No case information will be held on ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/10">ContactPoint is being developed with extensive input from a wide range of stakeholders. These include:</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/11">delivery partners&mdash;local authorities and national partners (for example, voluntary and community sector organisations);practitioners and managers from across children's services, and bodies that represent them; andchildren, young people and parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/12">Over the past few months we have been considering the substantial stakeholder feedback we have received and looked at the implications that the resulting proposed changes could have on the system. It is clear from the considerable work we have done so far that we will need more time than we originally planned to address the changes to ContactPoint which potential system users suggested.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/13">The change to the timetable will mean that deployment of ContactPoint to the &quot;Early Adopters&quot; local authorities and national partners will be in September or October 2008. It will be deployed to all other local authorities and national partners in 2009, between January and May, depending on final deployment slots. The additional time available presents a number of opportunities to do more work in the period prior to ContactPoint deployment, which will help to realise some benefits earlier. The fundamental design of ContactPoint will not change; the alterations will make sure the system works even more effectively for users and improves the ability of local authority ContactPoint teams to manage user access.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/14">The news on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase> of the loss of large volumes of child benefit data from HMRC has raised questions about the safety of large scale personal data in other Government systems, including ContactPoint. ContactPoint will not contain any financial information (such as bank details) or case information (such as case notes, assessments, medical records, exam results or subjective observations).</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/15">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>, the department conducted an assessment of how personal data are stored and protected in the department. As a result of that assessment, I am confident that we have very robust procedures in place. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">Wednesday 21 November</phrase>, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. To this end, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided to commission an independent assessment of its security procedures. This will be undertaken by Deloitte. Delaying the implementation of ContactPoint will enable the independent assessment of security procedures to take place as well as address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users have told us they need.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/16">Delivery partners will receive further information early in the new year. In the mean time, progress will be reported to local project managers regularly through their ContactPoint implementation co-ordinators. They will work with individual authorities and national partners to agree new deployment slots as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>

	Crime: Pre-trial Witness Interviews
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27c.142.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="142"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0001.htm#07112756000040">
	<p pid="c.142.1/1">I am today announcing that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will be rolling out pre-trial witness interviews (PTWIs) throughout England and Wales. The rollout will be completed by April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.142.1/2">The use of PTWIs was proposed by the then Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith in the report <I>Pre-trial Interviews by Prosecutors</I> published in December 2004. The report proposed that prosecutors should be permitted to speak to witnesses about their evidence in order to assess the reliability of the evidence or to clarify complex evidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.142.1/3">In January 2006, the CPS introduced a pilot scheme in the CPS areas of Lancashire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Cumbria. The pilot scheme has been evaluated carefully and it has been decided that PTWIs will be implemented throughout England and Wales. As of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">26 November 2007</phrase>, 88 PTWIs had been conducted by Crown prosecutors in the pilot CPS areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.142.1/4">The decision to conduct a PTWI is at the discretion of the prosecutor having regard to the circumstances of the case. However, it has been found from the pilot scheme that prosecutors welcome the ability to conduct a PTWI with a witness if appropriate, as it allows the prosecutor to make better-informed prosecution decisions.</p>

	Crime: Reoffending

	<p pid="c.143.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (David Hanson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.1/2">I am today announcing the publication of a consultation document to inform the strategic plan for reducing reoffending from 2008-11. The consultation period runs from today to <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February 2008</phrase>, and the strategic plan will be published next spring. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office and on the internet at <a href="http://www.noms.justice.gov.uk/news-publications-">www.noms.justice.gov.uk/news-publications-</a> events/publications/consultations/RRSP_2008-2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.1/3">Reoffending causes real harm to individuals, to communities and to the economy. The costs of reoffending by ex-prisoners alone are significant.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.1/4">The Government have undertaken a successful programme of work to tackle reoffending since 1997. The latest results show that we have reduced proven adult reoffending by 5.8 per cent since 2000 against the predicted rate. Tackling reoffending is ongoing work and there is still more work to do to examine what other measures need to be in place to support offender management. The consultation paper seeks views from professionals working in the field on how the Government can capitalise on the successes to date, and continue to reduce reoffending rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.1/5"><I>Public Service Agreements (PSAs)</I></p>
	<p pid="c.143.1/6">From April 2008, a number of new public service agreement (PSA) targets will be introduced. The<I> Make Communities Safer PSA</I> includes a specific measure for reducing reoffending which focuses on the volume and seriousness of reoffending, thereby allowing us to monitor the success of our interventions with priority offender groups more closely, and reflect the impact that reducing reoffending has on overall crime rates. Other PSAs are also critical&mdash;specifically<I> Drugs and Alcohol</I>,<I> Socially Excluded Adults</I>, and<I> Young People: A Path to Success</I>. Each of these national agreements will act as levers to further embed the reducing reoffending agenda across government and at regional levels to support effective local delivery by partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.1/7"><I>Supporting Events</I></p>
	<p pid="c.143.1/8">The National Offender Management Service is today holding a national launch to promote the consultation. In recognition of that fact that co-operation between agencies is essential in successfully tackling reoffending alone, this event will also be used to launch the Department of Health's consultation<I>,</I><I></I><I>Improving Health; Supporting Justice</I> and a NOMS third sector action plan to build the contribution of the sector to work to reduce reoffending. Consultation events for partners in regions and Wales will follow in December and January.</p>

	Employment: Mental Health
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27c.144.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="144"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0001.htm#07112756000052">
	<p pid="c.144.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Peter Hain) made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/2">Mental health conditions are now the single biggest cause of both absence from work and people claiming incapacity benefits. Around 40 per cent of people currently receiving incapacity benefits are doing so because of mental ill-health, ranging from more common problems such as stress, anxiety and depression, to more serious conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/3">But the more common mental health conditions can be relatively easily treated and with the right support need not significantly affect people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/4">We know that being in work is usually good for people with all types of mental health problems and so there is a clear need to support people with mental health conditions to overcome or manage their problems, helping them to find or remain in work.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/5">I am therefore announcing, in partnership with the Secretary of State for Health, our intention to develop a national strategy for mental health and work, to ensure a co-ordinated response across government to the challenges faced by people of working age with mental health conditions and improve their employment chances.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/6">The strategy will look at issues such as stigma and discrimination that often prevent people with mental health problems from seeking help in the first place, let alone trying to find employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/7">The strategy will be overseen by a high-level group from business, the medical profession, academia, the third sector and stakeholder groups, chaired by the national director for health and work, Dame Carol Black, and including Lord Richard Layard.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/8">To support the strategy I am today also announcing a number of measures to ensure that mental health and employment support is delivered in a more holistic way, that we provide more advice and support to healthcare professionals and employers and improve the communication between these two key groups:</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/9">we will ensure that, wherever possible as they are rolled out across the country, the pathways to work and improving access to psychological therapies programmes are linked up, allowing customers to take up the full range of support available and experience their back-to-work and healthcare support as part of a seamless package; alongside this, we will establish a mental health forum to bring together all those involved in delivering pathways to work support, to share evidence and experiences in relation to support for people with mental health conditions;we will pilot an advice and support service for employers, especially smaller businesses, to help them to manage and support people with mental health conditions to remain in or return to work. We will explore the possibility of this service also providing support and advice for GPs as part of our efforts to more closely align employment and healthcare services;we will build on the strong partnerships already created with GPs through our pathways advisory services pilots, which test placing Jobcentre Plus advisers in GP surgeries, by expanding those pilots to treble the capacity. The enlarged pilots will have a particular focus on supporting people with mental health conditions and will be supported by a roll-out of our educational programme for GPs on health and work issues, focusing specifically on mental health and employment; and we will also explore ways to improve communications between GPs and employers to improve the likelihood of people working. As part of this we will ensure that the process for GPs to issue medical certificates that we are currently developing with employers, healthcare professionals and their representative bodies will allow them to be more positive&mdash;moving to a &quot;fitnote&quot; instead of a &quot;sicknote&quot;&mdash;and will make it easier for GPs to provide more helpful advice to patients and their employers about their fitness for work, especially for those with mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/10">All this work will contribute to improving the health and employment prospects of people of working age, which is the subject of the review currently being undertaken by Dame Carol Black, which will report to Ministers early in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/11">This will build on the substantial progress that has been made in this area since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/12">We have been transforming the support that we give to Jobcentre Plus customers with health conditions or disabilities, moving away from a system that abandons people to a life on benefits to one that helps them to realise their potential. The introduction of employment and support allowance which will replace incapacity benefit next autumn, along with the expansion of Pathways to Work across the country by April of next year will create a more positive system, built on rights and responsibilities and offering tailored support to help people back into work.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/13">The new medical test for the allowance&mdash;the work capability assessment&mdash;will be fairer, more accurate and more robust than the current personal capability assessment. Importantly, the mental capacity element of the assessment has been fundamentally improved and will be better able to assess the challenges faced by people with mental health conditions and learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/14">Alongside employment support, the Government have been working to make more treatments and health interventions available to people with mental health problems and there has been a significant increase in mental health expenditure since 1997. Only last month, the Secretary of State for Health announced the very welcome expansion of the improving access to psychological therapies programme. The service will ensure that, over the next three years, 3,600 new therapists will be trained and 900,000 more people will be treated for depression and anxiety. This will have a major impact on those of working age suffering from mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/15">We have therefore been working with medical professional bodies to ensure that GPs and healthcare professionals recognise the importance of work to the health and well-being of their patients; ensure speedy and effective investigation, treatment and rehabilitation; and give sound advice on fitness for work. This work has included the development and testing of a number of training and education programmes and other supportive tools.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/16">Equally important is ensuring that employers understand the challenges faced by people with health problems, so that they can make appropriate adjustments to allow people to remain at work while their health conditions are addressed or to return to work in a phased way as part of their recovery. We are working across government as part of the health, work and well-being strategy to engage and support employers. For example, the Department of Health's Action on Stigma campaign, &quot;Shift&quot;, in October launched a new package of supportive tools on mental ill-health, designed to give advice on managing and supporting people with mental health problems in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.1/17">Today's announcement is further evidence of our commitment to achieve a step-change in the support available to help people with mental health conditions find and remain in work.</p>

The report also identifies a range of challenges that cohesion policy may be confronted with in the coming years and puts forward a set of questions for consultation. The consultation was formally launched at the Fourth Cohesion Forum in Brussels, held on the 27 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-28">28 September 2007</phrase>, which I attended and will close on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.146.1/3">Cohesion policy is supported by actions at EU, national, regional and local levels. The consultation is not therefore solely about the structural and cohesion funds (SCFs) which have new objectives for the 2007-13 period.</p>
	<p pid="c.146.1/4">The SCFs are, however, a significant part of the EC budget, on which the Commission has recently published a communication &quot;Reforming the Budget, Changing Europe&quot;, also for public consultation, to prepare for the budget review in 2008-09. According to the communication, the Commission's approach is one of openness and with nothing ruled in and nothing ruled out: it will prepare this review with no preconceptions and encourages all interested parties to contribute to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.146.1/5">The Government are considering their approach both to the Commission's consultation on the future of cohesion policy and to the budget review process.</p>
	<p pid="c.146.1/6">In considering the cohesion report the Government will be looking at:</p>
	<p pid="c.146.1/7">the aims of cohesion policy; and the most efficient mechanisms for achieving these aims.</p>
	<p pid="c.146.1/8">The Government's view on the EC budget is that it should be reformed so that the EU is better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Its approach is set out in the recent publication, <I>Global Europe: Meeting the Economic and Security Challenges, October 2007</I>. This identifies budgetary reform as one of the priority areas for EU action and sets out the three principles that will guide the Government's approach when considering how to achieve budgetary reform. Based on these principles, a priority for reform in the future will be &quot;a significant increase in the percentage of structural and cohesion funds (SCFs) spent on poorer member states&quot;. This is consistent with the policy direction set out in the Government's March 2003 publication, <I>A modern regional policy for the United Kingdom</I>.</p>
	<p pid="c.146.1/9">The Government encourage interested parties in the UK to respond directly to the Commission on the cohesion report. We would also be interested in their views.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27c.147.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="147"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0002.htm#07112756000076">
	<p pid="c.147.1/1">I attended the EU Education Council to represent the UK on behalf of DCSF and DIUS.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/2">Ministers discussed the following issues:</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/3"><I>European Qualifications Framework</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Political Agreement</I></p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/4">The council agreed the European Parliament amendments to the EQF. These amendments were in line with the general approach that had been agreed previously at the Education Council, and there were no additional comments.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/5"><I>Improving the quality of teacher education</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Adoption of Conclusions</I></p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/6">The conclusions are intended to help countries to improve teaching standards and attract high-quality teachers into the profession. The UK was happy to support these conclusions, which were adopted without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/7"><I>Education and Training as a Key Driver of the Lisbon Strategy</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Adoption of Resolution</I></p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/8">This resolution focuses on the role that education and training have to play within the Lisbon strategy, notably the role of education in the knowledge triangle, the links between education and training and other Lisbon policies, and the effective use of peer learning and the open method of co-ordination. The resolution was formally adopted with no discussion, and the Commission gave information on the joint report of the 2010 work programme, a draft of which it had accepted earlier in the week.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/9"><I>New Skills for New Jobs&mdash;Adoption of Resolution</I></p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/10">This resolution emphasises the importance of anticipating skills needs and providing opportunities for citizens to improve their skill levels to match these needs. I intervened to congratulate the presidency on this initiative, to reinforce the fact that skills have an enabling role and help Europe to compete in an increasingly globalised world, and to emphasise the importance of training those with low skills and those most at risk of social exclusion. The resolution was then adopted with no further comments.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/11"><I>Towards a More Multilingual Europe</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Exchange of Views</I></p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/12">Most Ministers welcomed this focus on multilingualism, stressing the important social and economic role it has to play within the EU. The main points raised during the discussion included the issues surrounding language training for migrants and the importance of looking beyond the EU to other important global languages. I intervened to acknowledge that the UK has not historically performed well in the teaching and learning of foreign languages, but that significant initiatives have been introduced in recent years. I stressed the importance of all languages, rather than just European languages, in fostering strong and cohesive multicultural communities. It would be a mistake to regard the languages used by long-settled communities as simply an &quot;immigration&quot; issue without regard to pride in historic cultural roots.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/13"><I>Erasmus Mundus Action Programme (2009-2013</I><I>)&mdash;</I><I> General Approach</I></p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/14">Ministers agreed a general approach on the new phase of the Erasmus Mundus programme, which will see an expansion of the programme to all levels of higher education, but particularly to doctoral studies, and provide additional financial support for EU students.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/15"><I>Resolution on Modernising Universities</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Exchange of views</I></p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/16">Ministers discussed this resolution, which addresses issues around autonomy, governance, curricula and mobility and will go to the Competitiveness Council (<phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November</phrase>) for formal adoption. I supported the joint approach linking mutually reinforcing areas of university and research policy, and stressed the importance of member states committing to university reforms, which are important for both economic reasons and for the life of universities. Other Ministers reported some progress in reform but were frank about how much more was needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/17"><I>Student mobility: broadening the social dimension of Erasmus</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Exchange of views</I></p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/18">This discussion saw a call from many Ministers for &quot;positive discrimination&quot; in the awarding of grants, to encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate. France stated that it would work on this during its presidency. Anne Lambert, UK Deputy Permanent Representative, intervened to underline the importance of mobility in meeting the challenges of globalisation.</p>

	<p pid="c.149.1/2">I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels. My right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Defence (Des Browne) and for International Development (Douglas Alexander) attended discussions of Defence and Development Ministers on 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.149.1/7">The presidency presented the draft agenda for the European Council.

I intervened to emphasise UK support for the summit's objectives, but also concern that these should not be undermined by the attendance of President Mugabe. If he did attend, it was important there was substantive discussion of human rights and governance in Zimbabwe, in plenary with President Mugabe present.</p>
	<p pid="c.149.1/17"><I>Pakistan</I></p>
	<p pid="c.149.1/18">I briefed partners on recent developments, highlighting the potential impact on EU objectives for the region. It was important to maintain pressure on President Musharraf to end the state of emergency and ensure free and fair elections, as set out in the presidency statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase>. The presidency reiterated these points in its statement to the press following the council.</p>
	<p pid="c.149.1/19"><I>Russia</I></p>
	<p pid="c.149.1/20">The council discussed the recent decision by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) not to monitor the Duma elections in Russia, in response to restrictions imposed by the Russian authorities.

These commit the EU to further support to Iraq through the UN, through humanitarian assistance and through support to the Government of Iraq in its work on the international compact and human rights. They also encourage engagement by Iraq's neighbours and call on the Governments of Iraq and Turkey to co-operate to ensure the integrity of the border and that Iraqi territory is not used for attacks on its neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="c.149.1/29"><I>Western Balkans</I></p>
	<p pid="c.149.1/30">EU troika representative Ambassador Ischinger briefed the council on the negotiation process. I underlined that the EU had to be ready to set out its position in December and act resolutely thereafter if negotiations failed to produce agreement between the parties.</p>
	<p pid="c.149.1/31">Conclusions were agreed reaffirming EU support for Ambassador Ischinger, welcoming the conduct of elections in Kosovo, but regretting the poor turnout from the Kosovo Serb community and Belgrade's call for a boycott.

	<p pid="c.153.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.153.1/2">Today the Government are announcing their timetable for the introduction during 2008 of the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.153.1/3">From the autumn 2008 the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act will come into force. The Act enables courts to make orders to protect those at risk of forced marriage or any attempt to force a person into marriage or to protect a person who has been forced into a marriage. The approach taken gives the courts a wide discretion to deal flexibly and sensitively with the circumstances of each individual case, employing civil remedies that will offer protection to victims without criminalising members of their family.</p>
	<p pid="c.153.1/4">The new provisions take the form of a new Part 4A to the Family Law Act 1996, placing them firmly in the wider context of domestic violence and family proceedings generally. During the next year the Government will consult on how to ensure that the Act is implemented effectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.154.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Department of Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/2">In the White Paper <I>Planning for a Sustainable Future</I>, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May 2007</phrase>, we set out a wide-ranging package of proposals for reform of the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/3">Planning is critical to protecting the countryside and our environment, building sustainable homes and communities, and supporting growth and prosperity. It also plays a vital role in ensuring individuals and local communities have a say in what gets built.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/4">Since 1997 we have made major improvements to town and country planning: more houses are being built, with better use of brownfield land; more development in town centres is helping to revitalise our towns and cities; planning decisions are being made quicker; and we have made the system more efficient and customer focused.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/5">But significant problems remain. The planning system remains too complex, bureaucratic and inefficient. These problems are particularly acute for major infrastructure projects, which are subject to different planning regimes. Currently, a single project may require consent under numerous different regimes. Lack of clarity in national policy, poor preparation of specific project proposals, lengthy and adversarial inquiry processes and slow decision-making mean that some planning decisions have taken years.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/6">These delays, combined with the lack of certainty in the system, can result in high costs for business; prolonged uncertainty and blight for communities; and pose a serious threat to UK competitiveness, growth and jobs. Moreover delays in the provision of essential infrastructure needed to ensure clean, secure energy and water supplies and decent transport have quality-of-life implications for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/7">We need to ensure that the planning system enables us to meet the long-term challenges we face as a society:</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/8">to meet our climate change objectives by speeding up the shift to renewable and low carbon energy, supporting the development of low and zero-carbon homes and businesses; and ensuring development is resilient to the impacts of climate change;to achieve our target of 3 million new homes by 2020 so current and future generations have access to a decent home at a price they can afford; to enable us to meet the challenge of globalisation by being efficient and responsive to business needs; and supporting the development of vital infrastructure, such as ports, roads and airports, needed to ensure that the UK continues to attract investment and jobs; andto provide certainty for investment in new infrastructure such as power stations, gas storage facilities and electricity networks need to ensure energy supplies are secure.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/9">Our proposals for planning reform are a central part of the Government's wider agenda for addressing these long term challenges in a way which demonstrates our commitment to achieving a prosperous economy and high quality of life for all; while also reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/10">The White Paper proposed that we should establish a new, single consent regime for nationally significant transport, energy, water and waste infrastructure projects under which:</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/11">the Government will set out in national policy statements the case for nationally significant infrastructure, integrating social, economic and environmental policies. These statements will be subject to thorough public consultation, appraisal of sustainability and parliamentary scrutiny;developers will be required to consult local communities and other key stakeholders as they prepare those projects and before they submit an application; anddecisions on applications will be made by the independent Infrastructure Planning Commission using streamlined inquiry procedures. Inquiries and decisions would be subject to statutory timetables.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/12">Responses to the White Paper have indicated that there is clear agreement that the current system is not working effectively. Our proposals have been widely welcomed including by business and many in the planning community and local government.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/13">However a number of issues and concerns have been raised. Questions have arisen in particular about:</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/14">how we propose to take forward the proposals for national policy statements; the need to ensure sustainable development is central to the new regime; ensuring people can influence and participate in policy and decisions; and ensuring decisions are fair and accountable.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/15">The proposal to produce national policy statements for major infrastructure sectors has been welcomed by the large majority of respondents to the White Paper. Over the forthcoming months, my colleagues the Secretaries of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Transport, and the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will set out further details of how they propose to ensure national policy in their infrastructure sectors is clearly set out; a short summary of proposals is at Annexe A.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/16">We acknowledge that it is essential to ensure that our objectives in relation to sustainable development are central to consideration of future infrastructure needs. The Bill will therefore include a duty on Ministers to ensure that national policy statements are drawn up with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. We will also make it a requirement that all national policy statements should be subject to an appropriate appraisal of the sustainability of the policy they set out.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/17">The Bill will also put effective public consultation and participation at the heart of all three key stages in the regime:</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/18">by creating a clear duty to ensure effective public consultation on national policy statements. We intend that this consultation should include positive and proactive means of engaging citizens and communities. Where national policy statements identify locations or potential locations for development, there will be a duty to consult in those locations; by placing clear legal obligations on developers to consult local communities before they submit a planning application, and ensure that this consultation is of high quality; and by making planning inquiries accessible and ensuring peoples' rights to be heard are protected. In particular the Bill will make it clear that any person who registers an interest can give oral evidence at relevant stages of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/19">In order to support more effective engagement with communities and hard-to-reach groups, we will be increasing the resources we provide to bodies that promote community engagement in planning. We also intend that local authorities should have an important role in ensuring the views of the communities they represent are fully reflected.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/20">Finally, the Bill will strengthen accountability and ensure decision-making is fair and transparent:</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/21">Government Ministers will be clearly accountable for setting overall policy. There will be a clear distinction between responsibility for setting policy, and responsibility for the quasi-judicial decisions;Parliament will have a stronger role in scrutinising national policy; the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be required to take decisions within a clear framework of legal duties set by Parliament and policy set by Government. It will also be subject to requirements designed to ensure full accountability to Ministers, Parliament and the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/22">To provide the stronger role for Parliament, we encourage the House to establish a new Select Committee with the main purpose of holding inquiries into draft national policy statements in parallel with public consultation. We suggest that this committee should be comprised of members from the existing Select Committees on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, on Transport and on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/23">We will consider the committee's reports together with responses to public consultation and revise draft national policy statements where appropriate, before designating them. In addition, if the committee has recommended that a national policy statement raises issues which should be debated by Parliament as a whole, we will make available time in each House for a debate before we designate it.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/24">This model&mdash;in which decisions are taken independently, on an objective basis, by a body with no role in promoting particular policy outcomes&mdash;offers clear benefits in terms of increased transparency and certainty to both applicants and the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/25">We have noted concerns that the White Paper may have defined too narrowly the matters the IPC may take into account in reaching decisions. We are clear that the national policy statement should be the primary policy consideration for the commission. However we agree that the commission must be able in taking decisions to have discretion to take account of all information specific to the case before it which it considers relevant and important to its decision, including all such local impacts. The Bill will make it clear that this is the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/26">We have also concluded that there may be some very exceptional circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to leave final decisions to the commission. These circumstances would arise where new issues or evidence are raised relevant to an application before the commission which are so significant that the Government consider they may justify a change of national policy. Where this was the case, the relevant Secretary of State could direct the commission to suspend consideration of the application until he or she had reviewed the national policy statement. However, where there is an application before the IPC which needs to be determined urgently in the national interest, the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to direct the IPC to produce a recommendation with the final decision to be taken by the Minister. We would expect such cases to be very rare so the Bill will therefore set out clearly the conditions that will apply to the exercise of this power.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/27">Overall, we believe that our proposals for major infrastructure will reduce the average time taken for large applications by a half. By doing so, they will save between &pound;3.8 billion and &pound;4.8 billion in costs up to 2030. And they will do this while extending our commitment to ensure sustainable development is at the heart of planning; strengthening opportunities for public consultation and engagement; and improving accountability.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/28">In addition to our proposals for reform of major infrastructure, the Bill will include a number of significant measures aimed at ensuring that the town and country planning better supports housing growth and climate change, and is more streamlined and efficient.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/29">The Bill will implement our proposals to introduce a new charge, entitled the community infrastructure levy, to enable local authorities to secure a bigger contribution from developers towards the costs of infrastructure. We are pleased that our proposals have been widely welcomed by developers and local government. We will publish further details of the proposals on my department's website.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/30">Local plans have a key part to play in enabling local authorities to set a clear strategic vision for their communities. The Bill will therefore include a number of provisions to make plan-making simpler and more flexible, which will be supported by a revised planning policy statement. It will also include a new duty on local authorities to take action on climate change through local plans. This duty will be underpinned by a new planning policy statement on climate change which we will publish before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/31">Finally, the Bill will include provisions to reduce the number of planning applications, speed up appeals and simplify the tree preservation order system. It will include provisions which would enable local member review bodies to determine appeals.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/32">These provisions in the Bill will be supported by a range of measures to make it easier for homeowners to extend their homes and to install microgeneration technology, to introduce new planning performance agreements which will ensure large applications are dealt with effectively, and to allow an increase in fees for planning applications in order to enable local authorities to improve the quality of service they provide. We also intend to consult on a new planning policy statement on economic development before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/33">Further details of these and other reforms are set out in the Government's summary of responses to the White Paper consultation, published today and which has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and to the related consultations which will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/34">The Planning Bill will play a key part in delivering on this Government's long-term vision for Britain. Alongside legislation on housing and regeneration, climate change, energy and local transport this Bill will help to deliver our objectives in relation to housing, climate change, energy security, transport provision, and prosperity and quality of life for all. The Planning Bill will do this by ensuring that we have an efficient planning system which produces fair and transparent outcomes on decisions which are vital both to the local communities they most affect, and to the long term challenges facing us as a nation.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/35">Annexe on National Policy Statements</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/36"><I>Energy</I></p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/37">The Government will publish an overarching national policy statement covering key elements of energy policy relevant to infrastructure provision, such as climate change, security of supply and the energy market, and including information relevant to likely future demand and measures to secure energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/38">Energy national policy statements will also be expected to encompass different forms of energy generation such as fossil fuels, renewable energy, electricity networks and gas infrastructure</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/39"><I>Transport</I></p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/40">The Government's aim is to establish a suite of national policy statements that will comprise:</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/41">a statement for aviation incorporating the 2003 Air Transport White Paper in a way which meets our proposed policy and statutory requirements for national policy statements; we are already committed to producing a further progress report between 2009 and 2011, which would provide a good opportunity to designate the ATWP in conjunction with that report;a statement for ports, possibly incorporating international freight, based on the work already undertaken as part of the ports policy review; anda statement for the strategic national highway and rail networks focusing primarily on the highway network, given that comprehensive plans for the rail network were published earlier this year in the HLOS and supporting rail White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/42">These statements will over time be aligned with the overarching transport strategy now under development, reflecting the cross-modal approach recommended by Rod Eddington, in order to ensure a consistent analytical and policy framework. The recent discussion document <I>Towards a Sustainable Transport System</I> sets out how the department proposes to develop this strategy, working with transport users and other stakeholders over the period to 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/43"><I>Water infrastructure</I></p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/44">The Government will set out updated policies for water supply and water quality in a new water strategy, <I>Future Water, </I>which is due to be published early in 2008. This will inform development of a new national policy statement on infrastructure development for water supply and waste water treatment for the period from 2010 to 2035. The national policy statement will also be informed by parallel to planning and price review processes such as the water resource management plans which water companies will produce and the quinquennial reviews of water company sewerage charges.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/45"><I>Waste disposal</I></p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/46">A national policy statement on waste will set out the Government's objectives for the development of waste infrastructure for the period to 2020 and will be based substantially on the waste strategy for England which was published in May 2007 after extensive consultation and engagement. We expect to prepare a waste national policy statement which will draw out and, if necessary, strengthen material in the waste strategy to enable the IPC to make decisions on projects coming forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/47"><I>Offshore renewables</I></p>
	<p pid="c.154.3/48">The IPC and the Marine Management Organisation proposed under the Marine Bill White Paper will have responsibilities for consents to offshore renewables projects of specific generating capacities. Both will operate in accordance with consistent government policy in this area whether set out in the relevant NPS or in the marine policy statement.</p>

	Transport: Local Transport Capital Settlement
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27c.160.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="160"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0004.htm#07112756000211">
	<p pid="c.160.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Rosie Winterton) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.1/2">Today, I am announcing the distribution of a package of funding of more than &pound;4 billion to improve local transport outside London over the remaining three years of the local transport plan period. An indicative announcement of half of this funding package was made last year. This announcement confirms that funding is available now that the comprehensive spending review has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.1/3">It builds on the &pound;8.5 billion provided to the 122 local transport authorities, including the six passenger transport authorities, over the past seven years for small local transport improvements and capital highways maintenance. These improvements tackle pinch points, improve integration and provide genuine alternatives to the car.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.1/4">The &pound;4.036 billion package consists of &pound;1.768 billion for integrated transport improvements and &pound;2.268 billion for highways capital maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.1/5">This capital funding is in addition to the &pound;2.3 billion made available in regional funding allocations for local authority major schemes and Highways Agency schemes of regional significance over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.1/6">Local transport plans have now been implemented for more than six years. Local transport authorities can be proud of the way they are creating safer, cleaner environments. They have made great progress in reducing local road casualties, improving the condition of many local road networks, providing facilities for cyclists and pedestrians and integrating of transport planning alongside that of health, education and housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.1/7">Alongside this year's settlement we have also confirmed financial planning guidelines (announced last year) for a specific road safety grant set up as part of the move to integrate safety cameras into the wider road safety delivery process from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. The funding totals &pound;330 million over three years&mdash;that is, &pound;110 million per year. Of that, &pound;286 million is being distributed to local authorities outside London. The remaining &pound;44 million is for London and national agencies. This funding represents a long-term commitment to fund further improvements in road safety and provides local authorities and their partners with the flexibility to implement a locally agreed mix of road safety measures that will deliver the greatest reductions in road casualties in their area.</p>
	<p pid="c.160.1/8">Details of the 2008-09 to 2010-11 allocations have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and are also available at<a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/regional/ltp/capital/ltpsettle07/">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/regional/ltp/capital/ltpsettle07/</a></p>
