	Agricultural and Horticultural Levy Bodies
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-28d.61.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="61"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060628/text/60628-38.htm#60628-38_spmin0">
	<p pid="d.61.1/1">The right honourable Margaret Beckett announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-11">11 November 2005</phrase> the main conclusions of an independent review of the five statutory agricultural and horticultural levy bodies and the start of a public consultation on the recommendations of that review.</p>
	<p pid="d.61.1/2">Following completion of the public consultation process and discussions with main stakeholders, I and my ministerial colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have concluded that the statutory levy should be retained in all sectors but that a number of improvements should be made to the current arrangements. We have also concluded that processor and dealer levies should continue in those sectors where they currently apply, and the general and promotional levies in the meat sector should be merged.</p>
	<p pid="d.61.1/3">The five existing levy boards&mdash;the Horticultural Development Council, the British Potato Council, the Home Grown Cereals Authority, the Milk Development Council, and the Meat and Livestock Commission&mdash;will be replaced with a single levy board and a number of wholly owned subsidiary, sectoral companies covering horticulture, potatoes, cereals, milk, pigs, beef and lamb. The new structure will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.61.1/4">Prior to the new structure coming into place, it is intended that the chair-designate will conduct a &quot;fresh start&quot; review of the current requirements of each sector, take a view on what activities could meet those needs, and consider what implications that might have for the levy rates in the different sectors.</p>
	<p pid="d.61.1/5">Restructuring of the levy boards will require the passing of an affirmative statutory instrument, under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.61.1/6">Ministerial colleagues in the Welsh Assembly Government and the Scottish Executive will be making statements today concerning the future of the meat bodies, Hybu Cig Cymru and Quality Meat Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="d.61.1/7">A summary of the responses to the public consultation received by Defra is available on Defra's website. Copies of the public consultation responses themselves are available in the Defra library.</p>

The Commission's briefing covered economic co-operation majoring on the financial markets regulatory dialogue. The UK welcomed the Commission's progress and pressed for greater detail on priority areas for progress next year, including moving into new sectors.</p>

	<p pid="d.62.3/1">I have today laid before Parliament the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (Supplementary Provisions) Order 2006 (&quot;the order&quot;) under Section 143 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The order relates to Section 13A (&quot;Section 13A&quot;) of the Local Land Charges Act 1975 (&quot;the 1975 Act&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="d.62.3/2">Section 13A transfers the Lord Chancellor's responsibility with the consent of HM Treasury under the 1975 Act for setting local land charges search fees, except fees for personal searches, to registering authorities (usually local authorities) in England. Section 13A requires registering authorities to set fees for local land charge services. It also provides that before setting fees local authorities must have regard to such guidance as the Lord Chancellor may have issued.</p>
	<p pid="d.62.3/3">Section 13A was inadvertently and prematurely brought into force by the Constitutional Reform Act (Commencement No. 5) Order 2006 on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April 2006</phrase>. The commencement of Section 13A revoked the previous rules specifying fees under the 1975 Act without notice and before any guidance had been issued to registering authorities. This was a serious error for which I apologise to the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.62.3/4">The order corrects this error. It provides that for the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April 2006</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> each registering authority will, in the exercise of its duty under Section 13A, be treated as having specified the fees that were chargeable before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April</phrase>. This period will allow sufficient time for the Department for Constitutional Affairs to prepare and consult on guidance to registering authorities on the exercise of their duty under Section 13A and for those authorities to prepare properly for setting their own fees. The order does not invalidate any fees that may have been specified and collected by a registering authority under Section 13A before <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-28">28 June 2006</phrase>.</p>
