	<p pid="a.31.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Employment (Chris Grayling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/2">The trial for the reassessment of incapacity benefit customers in Aberdeen and Burnley has been under way since October last year. Over 1,000 customers have now been informed of the outcome of their reassessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/3">The trial has tested a new process providing a number of additional support measures for customers as they go through their reassessment journey. At key points, Jobcentre Plus staff telephone customers to inform them about what is happening and to ensure they have access to appropriate help and advice. Customers also have the opportunity to discuss the decision on their case with a decision maker, putting into practice one of the key findings in Professor Harrington's recent review of the work capability assessment. These additional support measures have been welcomed by staff and customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/4">We want to ensure that the experience gained in the trial is shared across all of the centres that will be dealing with the reassessment of incapacity benefit claimants before we move to the full, national rollout in April. So we intend to have a limited, introductory phase in every centre carried out in the same controlled conditions as Burnley and Aberdeen. This will ensure the process remains robust and we continue to learn valuable lessons as more customers are involved in more areas across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/5">At the end of February, we will begin this introductory phase. Letters will be sent to 1,000 customers a week nationally, marking the commencement of their reassessment. So a total of around 300 people will be assessed in each reassessment centre over this period. In April, we will step up the implementation and increase the number of cases to around 7,000 a week. From May we will be processing the full caseload of around 11,000 cases per week. This steady ramp-up of activity will ensure that Jobcentre Plus and its partners are ready and can deal with the volume of cases as it builds. Customers' reactions to the changes will be closely monitored and lessons applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.3/6">Our plans are on track. Reassessment remains a key priority for this Government. We cannot allow people to be trapped on benefits, but we will ensure people get the benefits and support that they are entitled to.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Employment (Chris Grayling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/2">The informal meeting of Employment and Social Policy Ministers took place on 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-18">18 January 2011</phrase> in Budapest, Hungary. I represented the United Kingdom on day one of the meeting and my honourable friend, Edward Davey, Minister for Employment Relations, Consumer and Postal Affairs, attended the second day.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3">The themes for this two-day informal meeting were tackling youth unemployment and creating an employment-friendly recovery, which were discussed in workshop sessions. In the first workshop, tackling youth unemployment, the presidency underlined the importance of increasing youth labour market participation. Possible solutions included raising skills, better careers advice, incentives to employ young workers, strengthening entrepreneurship and use of European Union funds, especially the European Social Fund. The Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner highlighted some of the ideas in its Youth on the Move flagship initiative, including open-ended contracts and a youth guarantee and encouraged member states to take up these proposals. For the UK, I intervened to state that the European Union should prioritise a broad-ranging growth and competitiveness agenda and remove unnecessary regulation. I stressed the vital importance of impact assessments for any new regulation and early action to tackle unemployment by increasing labour market participation and improving skills. I outlined key UK policies that supported this agenda and highlighted the potential for member states to learn from each other through the open method of co-ordination. I also stressed that it was not necessary to apply the same solution in each member state. We needed flexibility around common goals. Many delegations broadly welcomed the Youth on the Move initiative although some argued that European Union-level action should not specify solutions and respect the differences in member states' industrial relations systems. Otherwise, there was a broad consensus on the need for education reform and improving skills levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/4">In the second workshop, the presidency noted that while the economic outlook was brightening, employment rates were not improving and that meeting the Europe 2020 employment target would be a significant challenge. It emphasised the importance of promoting labour demand through labour-intensive investments focusing on those furthest from the labour market. The Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner argued for doubling of effort to avoid a jobless recovery. The New Skills and Jobs flagship initiative, the joint employment report and the annual growth survey were all recent Commission initiatives aimed at promoting growth. The Commission would adopt guiding principles to assist job creation later this year, focusing on addressing administrative and legal obstacles to hiring and firing; reducing non-wage labour costs; and measures to assist the move from informal and undeclared work into regular employment. Finally, the Commissioner argued the case for more and more visible ESF funding and better use of the EU Micro Finance. For the UK, my honourable friend, Edward Davey, Minister for Employment Relations, Consumer and Postal Affairs, agreed with the emphasis on skills and training and stressed the importance of apprenticeships and benefit reform to help vulnerable workers. He also highlighted UK plans to simplify employment law, thereby reducing regulatory burdens on business as well as retaining a fair deal for workers.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.1/4">Following receipt of Ofcom's report and in the interests of transparency I want to inform the House of the timeline and process that I have followed to date in my considerations of the relevant public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/5">As such I am today publishing the following documents, copies of which will also be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses:</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/6">Ofcom's report on the public interest issues relating to News Corporation's proposed acquisition of BSkyB that was sent to me on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-31">31 December 2010</phrase> (with redactions for confidentiality);The OFT's report on jurisdiction that was sent to me on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-30">30 December</phrase>;My letters to News Corporation and BSkyB of <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-07">7 January 2011</phrase>;BSkyB's response of <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-13">13 January 2011</phrase> with confidential information redacted; andNews Corporation's response of <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-14">14 January 2011</phrase> with confidential information redacted.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/7">After careful consideration of the Ofcom report, which recommends referral to the Competition Commission, and as provided by Section 104 of the Enterprise Act 2002 that sets out my duty to consult adversely affected parties, I met with News Corporation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-06">6 January</phrase> to set out the process that I would follow and briefly explain Ofcom's conclusions. Having informed them of the process I then wrote to News Corporation and BSkyB on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-07">7 January</phrase> enclosing a copy of Ofcom's report. In this letter I explained that I was minded to refer the case to the Competition Commission but that I would receive written, and if necessary oral, representations from them if they wanted to challenge my thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-10">10 January</phrase> I met with Ofcom to seek clarification on a number of aspects of its report.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/9">In response to my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-07">7 January</phrase> BSkyB and News Corporation provided written representations challenging elements of Ofcom's report on 13 and <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-14">14 January</phrase> respectively. These documents have today been published. After considering these responses and consistent with Section 104 of the Enterprise Act I therefore met again with News Corporation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-20">20 January</phrase> to hear representations on the issues they highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/10">As a result of these meetings and my consideration of the Ofcom report and subsequent submissions from the parties involved I still intend to refer the merger to the Competition Commission. On the evidence available, I consider that it may be the case that the merger may operate against the public interest in media plurality.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/11">However, before doing so it is right that I consider any undertakings in lieu offered by any merging party which have the potential to prevent or otherwise mitigate the potential threats to media plurality identified in the Ofcom report.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/12">News Corporation says that it wishes me to consider undertakings in lieu which it contends could sufficiently alleviate the concerns I have such that I should accept the undertakings instead of making a reference. It is appropriate for me to consider such undertakings. In considering whether to accept undertakings in lieu, I will ask the OFT under Section 93 of the Enterprise Act 2002 as an expert public body with experience in negotiating undertakings in lieu to be involved in the process from this stage. I will also ask Ofcom under Section 106B for advice whether undertakings in lieu address the potential impact on media plurality.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/13">If this process produces undertakings in lieu which I believe will prevent or otherwise mitigate the merger from having effects adverse to the public interest, and which I propose to accept, I will then publish the undertakings in lieu and (as required under the Act) begin a formal 15-day consultation period during which time all interested parties will be able to express their views.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/14">It is in the nature of this process that I cannot give clear dates for each step as we move forward. My main concern is not to work to an arbitrary timetable but to ensure that I reach my decision in a fair and even-handed way which is transparent and ensures that all concerns are properly considered.</p>
