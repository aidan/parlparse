<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-25a.65.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="65"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70725-wms0001.htm#07072572000048">
	<p pid="a.65.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">31 July</phrase>, Operation Banner will come to an end; the Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy having delivered continuous support to the police and civil authorities in Northern Ireland for 38 years. It will have been the longest continuous deployment of UK Armed Forces in their history.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/3">As we move into a new era with fewer than 5,000 troops resident in Northern Ireland, trained and available for deployment worldwide, the military will retain some limited but specific responsibilities with the capability to deploy in situations of extreme public disorder in support of the Police Service of Northern Ireland under a new operation to be known as Operation Helvetic. The troops deployed in such circumstances would come from wherever they are available at the time. In addition, provision of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/4">Across the UK the Armed Forces can provide support to the civil authorities during emergencies under normal military aid to civil authorities tasking arrangements. Where there is an imminent threat to life, such as a major accident or natural disaster, the authorities can call upon local military commanders for support. After <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase> the vast majority of military support in Northern Ireland will be broadly comparable to the assistance that is currently provided in Great Britain, tailored for the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland. Additionally, while the Armed Forces are not responsible for maintaining national security in the UK, that does not mean that they would not and could not provide specific support in this area to a civil authority when requested to do so. Again, the approach in Northern Ireland will be brought more closely into line with that on the mainland.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/5">As indicated in the Good Friday agreement, military helicopters will continue to be based in Northern Ireland, but with a worldwide deployable role. As a consequence, essential flying training will continue in order to maintain the skills of the aircrew and, with Northern Ireland designated as Low Flying Area 19, the training emphasis will be similar to other areas within the UK. Helicopters will also continue to be used in Northern Ireland in support of the civil authorities. It is important to note that the civil authorities in Northern Ireland do not have access to large numbers of civilian helicopters and we will continue to provide support to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/6"><phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase> marks the beginning of a new era for the UK Armed Forces in Northern Ireland when, as with other parts of the country, the military will become very much part of the community. The impact of the commitment since 1969 has been considerable on both the military themselves and the MoD civilians supporting them. They and the community at large have suffered both death and injury. We should take this opportunity to remember the commitment, bravery and sacrifice of all those who have served over so many years in helping to deliver the current, more settled and more optimistic circumstances. Our recognition will culminate in a commemorative service to be held in the spring of 2008 as announced by my honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence in his Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May 2007</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 11 WS).</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-25a.68.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="68"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70725-wms0001.htm#07072572000074">
	<p pid="a.68.3/1">My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/2">I am today announcing the outcome of the recent consultation on<I></I>civil court fees. The consultation paper was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April</phrase> and the consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June</phrase>. Some 77 responses were received from the judiciary, legal professions and other stakeholder bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/3">After careful consideration of these, I have, with some adjustments, decided to proceed with the changes proposed. Three statutory instruments containing the new civil, family and non-contentious probate court fees will be laid before the House tomorrow and will take effect on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/4">A further statutory instrument containing the new fees for magistrates' courts is still being drafted and will be laid during the Recess. However, this should not affect the implementation date. A report analysing the responses to consultation will be published on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/5">The current system of exemptions and remissions has been replaced with a new system of concessions that will apply to all the fees orders. The scheme will be based on two distinct tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/6">The first test will determine whether the applicant is automatically entitled to a full remission of the court fee. This will apply if the applicant is currently receiving a prescribed means-tested benefit or, failing that, can demonstrate that their gross household income is below a threshold that probably entitles them to such a benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/7">The second, more detailed, test will consider both gross income and fixed outgoings to assess the applicant's net or disposable income. The applicant may then be required to pay a contribution towards the fee based on a fraction of their disposable income. This system is a simplified version of the means test for legal aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/8">In light of the responses received, we have reconsidered the original proposals and have adjusted some of the fees accordingly, putting together a package of solutions that positively and affordably addresses the majority of concerns. Those are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/9">A majority agreed that the new concession should have a residual discretion to grant remission in exceptional circumstances not covered by the means test. A clause has been added to allow this. Full training will be given to staff to understand what can and cannot be considered exceptional to maximise consistency.Vexatious litigants who would normally be exempt from paying court fees due to financial hardship will be required to pay the full fee of an application for permission to bring a case.Some of the proposals for downstream civil fees have been adjusted to better reflect the cost of the stages concerned; for example, the fee for allocation questionnaires and listing questionnaires has changed. This has created scope to make larger reductions to some of the higher-issue fees than originally proposed, meeting the criticism that these were too low.In the magistrates' courts, a fee of &pound;400 was proposed for appeals against the decisions of public authorities, mainly licensing decisions. Some respondents objected that this proposal was likely to deter those individuals from appealing to the granting of liquor licences in their neighbourhood. As a consequence, the definition has been amended so that it applies only to an appeal against a decision by a local authority to refuse a licence. The general fees that apply to miscellaneous magistrates' civil proceedings will apply to an appeal against the granting of a licence.Many consultees disagreed with the scale of proposed increases to fees for ancillary matters such as oaths, copying and searches. As a consequence, a number of detailed adjustments have been made.The proposal to pilot daily hearing fees in the specialist commercial jurisdictions in 2008 was met with opposition from respondents representing the views of legal practitioners and the judiciary of those courts. We therefore propose to review the scope proposed, to then be the subject of a target consultation. As a result, any introduction of a scheme is unlikely to take place before 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State (Michael Wills) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 10 August 2007</phrase>, Land Registry will launch a formal consultation exercise to seek views on proposals to create electronic legal charges (a form of mortgage) and other services that it proposes to make available on the Land Registry network during 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3">Proposed new land registration rules would, among other things, prescribe an electronic charge as the first kind of electronic disposition of registered land in England and Wales. Once an electronic legal charge has been created, a customer will be able to apply, using the Land Registry network, for it to be registered.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">It is proposed that the Land Registry network will also be used to provide an enlarged and enhanced electronic lodgement service in respect of applications for certain entries in the register and an enhanced chain matrix, an information tool that allows conveyancers and others to view the status of linked conveyancing transactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">Subject to the outcome of the proposals and the advice and assistance of the Rule Committee, it is anticipated that the new rules would come into force during 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo), has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/2">My right honourable friend the former Minister of State (Andy Burnham) announced the outcome of a departmental review of the progress made in reforming market entry arrangements for community pharmacies in England (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 19WS). This report found that, while still early days, those reforms had had a modest albeit uneven impact and identified a number of concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/3">To address these, my right honourable friend therefore announced a review of National Health Services pharmaceutical contractual arrangements. This would meet the commitment in paragraph 4.47 of <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say</I> to develop pharmaceutical contractual arrangements in line with the wider ambitions of that White Paper. He appointed Anne Galbraith, former chair of the Prescription Pricing Authority, to lead the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/4">Anne presented her report to Ministers in the spring. We have been considering and continue to consider Anne's findings and conclusions carefully. The Pharmacy All-Party Group also recently completed its own inquiry into pharmacy services, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-26">26 June</phrase> at <a href="http://www.appg.org.uk/inquiry.htm">www.appg.org.uk/inquiry.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/5">I believe that it is important that we reflect further on these reports in the context of wider developments that are taking place in the NHS and in particular the wide-ranging review that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-04">4 July</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 962).</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/6">We have therefore decided to defer responding formally to Anne's review until later this autumn. We will come forward with a White Paper, which will set out our future proposals for developing pharmacy services and any legislative reform necessary. We remain committed to pharmacy, its place in the NHS and its role in delivering quality services to patients and consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/7">In advance of this, we are launching today a departmental consultation on proposals to transfer to primary care trust allocations residual money still held centrally at the department to support NHS pharmaceutical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/8">This money, known as the &quot;global sum&quot;, covers a range of fees and allowances that are payable to community pharmacies under the national contractual framework for the provision of dispensing and other essential pharmaceutical services. Central funding also similarly pays appliance contractors, who supply patients with items such as stoma and incontinence care aids.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/9">This proposal, subject to parliamentary approval, would not come into force earlier than April 2009. It would bring this funding stream into line with other funding, which already pays pharmaceutical contractors for the costs of the drugs and appliances that they dispense, and align funding systems with those of other primary care professionals such as general practitioners and dentists.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/10">Although this is a small change to the legislation, it is important that the NHS and other organisations are given the opportunity to consider it in full prior to our introducing the necessary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/11">The consultation document has been placed in the Library and copies are available to honourable members from the Vote Office. It is also available on the department's website at: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/index.htm">www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations /Liveconsultations/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/12">Consultation will end on <phrase class="date" code="">16 October 2007</phrase>. We look forward to hearing the results. Subject to the outcome of this consultation, we expect to include these proposals in the forthcoming Health and Social Care Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Peter Hain) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/2">I am pleased to announce the appointment of Paul Myners as the chair designate of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority. His appointment will take effect as from <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase>. Paul Myners brings extensive experience to this role from his time as a director of NM Rothschild and Sons Ltd and National Westminster Bank, in addition to non-executive positions at Marks &amp; Spencer and Orange. This knowledge will be invaluable to the delivery authority in its initial advisory role to the Government and later when, subject to parliamentary approval, it faces the challenging task of implementing the personal accounts scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/3">Subject to parliamentary approval, personal accounts will be set up as a trust-based occupational pension scheme. The scheme will be set up in accordance with a framework set out in legislation and will be aimed at people on low to middle incomes. It will feature low charges and will use automatic enrolment, fulfilling one of the key recommendations of the Pensions Commission report.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/4">Implementing such a major occupational pension scheme, with the potential for up to 10 million members, is a sizeable task requiring particular skills and experience. Consultation with stakeholders across the financial services industry, employers, the Trades Union Congress and customer representatives highlighted the need to establish an independent body, staffed by professionals in the field, to be responsible for delivering personal accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/5">The Government are absolutely committed to making personal accounts a success. That is why they are setting up an independent body with the necessary skills and experience to get the policy design of personal accounts right and to ensure that the interests of members remain at the heart of the scheme. As chair designate of the delivery authority, Paul will bring a proven track record and a wealth of experience in the financial sector. One of his first tasks will be to take part in the selection of the authority's chief executive.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.1/1">My honourable friend the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/2">The above order subject to the affirmative procedure largely maintains the status quo on the taxation of participation fees for gaming and extends the scope of taxation for charges made for games played against the operator and to gaming provided illegally. The measure also includes some minor changes resulting from amendments to social law. The provisions of the order are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum, which is available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/3">The order is being laid today and will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2007</phrase> because:</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/4">it is consequent upon secondary legislation, the Gambling Act 2005 (Operating Licence Conditions) Regulations 2007, coming into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2007</phrase> made under the Gambling Act 2005 and laid before Parliament in draft on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June 2007</phrase>; andthe main provisions for remote gaming duty were included in the Finance Bill 2007, which received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/5">Time will be made available to debate the order as soon as possible after the House returns from the Summer Recess.</p>
