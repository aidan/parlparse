	<p pid="b.45.1/1">The Government announced plans for significant constitutional reform on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June 2003</phrase>, designed to enhance the independence of the judiciary and to ensure clarity in the relationship between the executive and the judiciary. I plan shortly to introduce the required statutory instruments to bring into force those parts of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 that will deliver the central aspects of those reforms. As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April 2006</phrase>, I intend to bring the new Judicial Appointments Commission into being and commence those aspects of the Act that give statutory effect to the provisions of the concordat I agreed with the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.1/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April</phrase>, the Lord Chancellor's role as a judge will cease. The Lord Chief Justice will hold the additional title of President of the Courts of England and Wales and be legally recognised as the head of the judiciary in England and Wales. As set out in the concordat, the role of the Lord Chief Justice will be significantly reformed and strengthened. To support the Lord Chief Justice, the Judicial Office for England and Wales has been established and the new head of that office has recently been appointed and taken up post.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/4" class="indent">&quot;In addition, to give effect to the new arrangements for the handling of judicial disciplinary matters, a new Office for Judicial Complaints will be established. The arrangements relating to judicial complaints and discipline will be published shortly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/5" class="italic">Judicial Independence and Rule of Law</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/6">As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April</phrase>, for the first time there will be a guarantee of continued judicial independence enshrined in statute, underpinned by particular duties binding on the Lord Chancellor and Ministers of the Crown to uphold judicial independence. The Act also formally recognises the constitutional principle of the rule of law and the Lord Chancellor's role in relation to that principle.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/7" class="italic">Judicial Appointments Commission</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/8">As of <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April 2006</phrase>, the Judicial Appointments Commission will be formally launched. The appointment of Baroness Prashar as the inaugural chair of the new commission was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.45.1/26">Ms Sara Catherine Nathan</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/27">The appointment of the final judicial member will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/28">The Judicial Appointments Commission will have responsibility for making selections for the appointment of all judicial office-holders (as provided for in Schedule 14 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005). Baroness Prashar, the Lord Chief Justice and I have considered the arrangements necessary to ensure that the commission can make the decisive and confident start that we are all agreed is essential.

	<p pid="b.49.1/1">My right honourable friend the Paymaster-General (Dawn Primarolo) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.1/2">Andy Burnham (Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Home Office) and I are today meeting with the banking industry to discuss the application of the Government's identity fraud strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.1/3">The Home Office is today making a statement about the national strategy for tackling ID fraud. Within this strategy, the Treasury and the FSA are working with the financial services industry to ensure it has in place the most effective systems to fight financial crime. New industry guidance to be published shortly will strengthen the system of ID checks whilst reducing the inconvenience for the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.1/4">HMRC will carry out an assessment of the typical profile of frauds committed against it to assist the banks in identifying suspect payments and accounts, enabling them to make timely suspicious activity reports to the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). HMRC will contact any firms that have been party to these frauds.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.1/5">The Chancellor and the Home Secretary recently asked Sir Stephen Lander, chair-designate of the forthcoming new Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), to undertake a review of the suspicious activity reporting regime. Sir Stephen is to report by the end of March 2006.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-01-23b.49.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="49"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60123-48.htm#60123-48_spmin2">
	<p pid="b.49.2/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/2">Further to Baroness Scotland's Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">Wednesday 18 January</phrase>, the Paymaster General Dawn Primarolo and I are this afternoon meeting senior figures in law enforcement and the banking sector to discuss action against ID fraud. The significance of ID fraud has been further emphasised by recent attempts by organised criminals to defraud the tax credit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/3">The meeting will discuss further ways of improving joint working on ID fraud, in particular through developing the work of public-private groups like the Home Office-led Identity Fraud Steering Committee (IFSC). Criminals who target the public sector are also likely to target the private sector. The meeting will also be discussing ways of ensuring the maximum appropriate sharing of information to protect public and private sector organisations from ID fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/4">As Baroness Scotland set out in her Statement, the introduction of a secure national identity scheme/identity cards scheme using biometric information will make a step change in protecting people from identity fraud. As part of the work of the Ministerial Committee on ID cards, HMRC and the Home Office continue to evaluate the role of the national identity register in combating identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/5">At the meeting, the Paymaster General and I will be proposing a four step action programme to be taken forward urgently over the next few months under the Identity Fraud Steering Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/6">First, Government will explore with CIFAS&mdash;the UK's fraud prevention service&mdash;the procedures for notifying it of the details of employees whose identities have been compromised as a result of large-scale ID theft. This will help ensure that employees whose records have been stolen will not suffer adverse impact on their credit ratings and protect their identities from further abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/7">Secondly, the IFSC will take forward urgently plans to encourage credit reference agencies and CIFAS to share information with the public sector, for example by welcoming public sector organisations into the CIFAS membership. It will also work to ensure public sector organisations take full advantage of these new opportunities, for example by becoming full members of the CIFAS network. This will ensure that the details of criminals who defraud, for example, the tax credit system are shared in the same way as those of criminals who attack private sector organisations. This will enable partners in both the public and private sectors to detect and prevent identity related crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/8">Thirdly, the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) will carry out a strategic review of all suspicious activity reports relating to tax credit and identity fraud to inform the strategy to tackle this threat.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.2/9">Fourthly, HMRC will produce an assessment of the typical profile of frauds committed to assist the banks in identifying suspect payments and accounts, enabling them to make timely suspicious activity reports to NCIS and SOCA.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/2">In my Statements of <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, cols. 49&ndash;50WS, and <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, cols. 40&ndash;41WS, I set out the need to streamline strategic health authorities (SHAs) and strengthen primary care trusts (PCTs) and the timetable and process for local consultations on these changes. Local consultations on changes to the boundaries of SHA began on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, cols. 151&ndash;153WS.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/3">The NHS Chief Executive, Sir Nigel Crisp, has now announced the appointment of 11 people who will lead the transition between current and future SHAs. The transition leads will take on this responsibility from <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase> until, subject to the final results of the consultation, new SHAs are created. Their task will be to oversee the creation of the new system over the next six months and specifically to oversee:</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/4" class="indent">planning for next year;</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/5" class="indent">the development programme for existing and new PCTs; and</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/6" class="indent">communications.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/7">These arrangements are being made for essential business continuity purposes. They do not prejudice the outcome of the consultation on the future shape of SHAs and each current SHA board will remain accountable to the Department of Health for its part of the NHS until Ministers determine whether, following the consultation, to establish new SHAs. Existing SHAs will remain responsible for managing the consultation process following <i>Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS</i>.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/8">The transition leads will ensure consistent management of the outcome of the consultation process across the cluster. Following the consultation process, if Ministers decide to establish new SHAs, the transition leads will be responsible for oversight of the process for establishing the new SHA, until permanent appointments are made. We expect to make permanent appointments to any new SHAs, if necessary, in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/9">We have emphasised that it is essential to ensure that the transition leads are creating a new system locally which works effectively with all our partners and stakeholders and particularly promotes joint working between health and social care and in the field of public health.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/10">The following have agreed to be SHA transition leaders:</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/11" class="indent">John Bacon: London</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/12" class="indent">Mike Farrar: Yorkshire</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/13" class="indent">David Flory: north-east</p>

	<p pid="b.52.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/2">The television licence fee settlement announced by the Government in February 2000 provides for changes in the licence fee of RPI plus 1.5 per cent for each year from 2000&ndash;01 to 2006&ndash;07. This settlement is designed to enable the BBC to provide a strong and distinctive schedule of high quality programmes and remain at the forefront of broadcasting technology. The settlement includes a requirement for the corporation to raise over &pound;1 billion through efficiency savings and increased income over the period.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/3">Application of the RPI figure of 2.7 per cent for the year to September 2005, plus 1.5 per cent, to the current unrounded licence fees produces new rounded totals of &pound;131.50 for a colour licence and &pound;44.00 for a black and white licence. The necessary regulations to bring these fees into force will be laid before the House in due course. The changes will come into effect from the <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year.</p>
