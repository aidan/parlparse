	RAF: Command Headquarters
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-20b.63.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="63"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050620/text/50620-23.htm#50620-23_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.63.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/2">In the 2004 Defence White Paper <i>Delivering Security in a Changing World</i> we referred to plans to collocate the strike and personnel and training command headquarters. This is part of a programme to create a modern, effective and efficient headquarters structure for the Royal Air Force.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/3">A study has been conducted into the potential for increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the two headquarters (currently based at RAF High Wycombe and RAF Innsworth) by rationalising and collocating them on a single site. This work was undertaken against the background of the reduction in size of the RAF from approximately 49,000 to 41,000 by 2008 announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, col. 348).</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/4">A number of sites were evaluated, including RAF High Wycombe and RAF Innsworth, to determine their relative operational and financial benefits. The study concluded that RAF High Wycombe offers the best value for money and is operationally more effective. I have therefore decided that, subject to trades union consultation, High Wycombe should be the site of the collocated RAF headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/5">The study also showed that, as a result of collocation, the headquarters will require some 1,000 fewer posts (500 service, 500 civilian) than the two current organisations. These reductions will contribute to the previously announced wider MoD manpower drawdown. Some 1,350 headquarters posts (600 service and 750 civilian) will be lost from RAF Innsworth. Personnel numbers at RAF High Wycombe will increase from some 2,050 posts now (1,540 service and 510 civilian) to around 2,150 (1,400 service and 750 civilian) by 2008. A number of posts currently based at High Wycombe will move to other RAF units.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/6">The target date for standing up the collocated headquarters is October 2006. However, in view of its role in managing the overall drawdown in RAF numbers, the Personnel Management Agency will not relocate to High Wycombe until April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/7">Part of the RAF Innsworth site is occupied by elements of the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) currently employing some 540 staff, including contractors. I expect the agency's presence at Innsworth to continue until mid 2008, during which time internal rationalisation unconnected with this announcement will have reduced the number of posts concerned to around 260 (including 170 MoD civilians and 70 contractor staff). The future location of this part of AFPAA is being examined. Unless another defence use is found for the Innsworth site, it will be disposed of once AFPAA relocates.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/8">The 200 support staff posts (110 service, 90 civilian) on the site will reduce in line with the overall drawdown.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/9">I recognise that this announcement will cause disappointment in the Innsworth area. However, I have to make the best decision for defence as a whole. We are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact on the staff concerned. Our current plans envisage that the civilian reductions, most of which will take place in the Gloucester area, will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early release. If we are obliged to resort to compulsory redundancies, we will endeavour to keep them to a minimum. Staff and the trades unions are being kept fully informed of developments through meetings, briefings and a formal consultation exercise.</p>

	National Standardisation Strategic Framework
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-20b.66.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="66"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050620/text/50620-23.htm#50620-23_spmin2">
	<p pid="b.66.1/1">I am pleased to announce that the benefits of standards to UK business, innovation and the wider economy can be quantified for the first time. A programme of studies commissioned by the National Standardisation Strategic Framework (NSSF), have brought together the analysis of findings from the University of Surrey, Nottingham University Business School and the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research in Germany. The principal findings of the report show that:</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/2" class="indent">formal standards contribute &pound;2.5 billion to the growth of the UK economy annually as a means of spreading knowledge and technology;</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/3" class="indent">through this role, since 1948 the benefit of formal standards to UK GDP exceeds &pound;75 billion;</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/4" class="indent">standards enable 13 per cent of the growth in labour productivity; and</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/5" class="indent">standards are emphasised as an enabler of innovation.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/6" class="indent">The report can be found on <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/iese/The-Empirical-Economics-of-Standards.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/iese/The&ndash;Empirical&ndash;Economics&ndash;of&ndash;Standards.pdf</a> and hard copies will be made available in the parliamentary Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/7">The National Standardisation Strategic Framework (NSSF) was developed by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) to provide a platform for increasing the awareness, use and understanding of standards and standardisation in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/8">This research quantifies the impact of standards on the success of UK business of all types.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/9">As the national standards body for the UK, the British Standards Institution plays an important role in enabling innovation and technology transfer within national and international markets. This creation of synergies is found to accelerate the speed to market of products and services which allows businesses to keep ahead of the game in an ever-changing marketplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/10">For many years business opinion has tended to divide regarding the genuine impact of standards. While many firms have embraced standards as a valuable tool for strategic management, others argue that their presence has acted as a halt on business freedom and competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/11">For that reason I commend to Parliament this research and urge UK industry to make business standards a boardroom issue in order to provide tangible assurances of progress across all aspects of commerce.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.1/3">A consultation paper is to be published today on the smoke-free elements of the Health Improvement and Protection Bill. This will begin a public consultation, which will run until <phrase class="date" code="">5 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/4">This is an England and Wales Bill, but the provisions described in detail in the consultation document apply to England only.
