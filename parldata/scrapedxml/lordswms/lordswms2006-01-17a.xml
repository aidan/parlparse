	<p pid="a.29.1/1">The UK will host an international conference on Afghanistan in London on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister will open the conference with His Excellency Hamid Karzai, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. My right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Jack Straw), the Secretary of State for Defence (John Reid), the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) and my honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Kim Howells) will represent the UK at different sessions.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">The conference has three aims:</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/3" class="indent">to launch the Afghanistan Compact, which is the successor to the Bonn agreement and will provide a framework for international community engagement in Afghanistan for the next five years. The compact will also establish a new co-ordination and monitoring mechanism to achieve greater coherence of effort between the Afghan Government and the international community, led for the latter by the UN;</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/4" class="indent">to provide an opportunity for the Government of Afghanistan to present their interim Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS) to the international community. The strategy will set out the Afghan Government's priorities for accelerating development, increasing security, tackling the drugs trade and strengthening governance. The Government of Afghanistan will also launch their updated National Drugs Control Strategy (NDCS) at the London conference; and</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/5" class="indent">to ensure that the Government of Afghanistan have adequate resources to meet their domestic ambitions and international commitments. The conference will review existing aid flows and future plans, and agree ways to improve the co-ordination, predictability and effective use of development assistance better to support the Afghan Government's priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/6">While the main conference focus will be the launch of the Afghanistan Compact, there will also be an opportunity to make new pledges in support of the aims outlined in the interim ANDS and the NDCS. Following the opening session and the launch of the compact, there will be further sessions on political perspectives, security, counter-narcotics, governance and reconstruction and development. The conference will be co-chaired throughout by the Afghan Government, the UK and the UN.</p>
