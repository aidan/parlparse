<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-12-07a.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="67"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51207-35.htm#51207-35_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.67.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) is making the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">I am placing in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of a new DfID policy paper, <i>Growth and poverty reduction; the role of agriculture</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/3">The paper analyses the importance of agriculture for poverty reducing growth and shows why agriculture should be placed at the heart of efforts to reduce poverty. Increasing agricultural productivity can bring benefits to both producers and consumers. But of equal importance are agriculture's strong links with the wider economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">The paper argues that reversing recent disappointing trends in agriculture's performance is critical if poor countries are to escape the trap of slow growth and poverty. This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa, where growth in agricultural output has barely kept pace with population. A major improvement in agriculture's performance in the world's poorest countries is possible and must be achieved if millions of people are to escape poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/5">The paper reaffirms the rationale for DfID support to agriculture and lays out the principles and priorities that should direct DfID's approach. Seven priority areas for action are identified. They are to: create policies and procedures that support agriculture; target public spending more effectively; tackle market failure; fill the agricultural finance gap; spread the benefits of new technology; improve access to land and secure property rights; and reduce distortions in international agricultural markets.</p>
