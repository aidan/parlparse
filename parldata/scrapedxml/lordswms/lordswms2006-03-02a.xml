	EU: Education and Youth Council
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-03-02a.31.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="31"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60302-40.htm#60302-42_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.31.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education (Bill Rammell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/2">Ms Anne Lambert, UK Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU, represented the UK during the Education and Youth Council in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/3">At Education Council in the morning:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/4">The Commission presented its annual progress report on the Lisbon strategy, together with the joint report of the Council and the Commission on progress under the Education and Training 2010 work programme: <i>Modernising Education and Training: a vital contribution to prosperity and social cohesion in Europe</i>. The council adopted the joint report, along with a short key messages document based on this report to forward to the spring European council. Ministers stressed in particular the importance of education and training in the Lisbon strategy, while noting the need to maintain a balance between the social and economic objectives of education policies. In discussion, Ministers warned against setting input targets for investment in education and training, which would not by themselves improve the effectiveness of spending. They also noted the importance of increasing private investment in higher education, where Europe currently lags behind its main competitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/5">Ministers had an exchange of views on the basis of the Commission's proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the council on key competences for lifelong learning, on which the presidency hopes for general agreement at the May council. Ministers were asked to comment on the proposed framework of key competences, and on how they are addressing the acquisition of key competences at national level. The UK tabled a position paper on the recommendation, setting out UK policy on skills development. In general, Ministers welcomed the key competences framework as a useful voluntary reference tool for member states to use when developing their curricula and strategies for lifelong learning. Ministers emphasised the importance of giving special attention to disadvantaged groups, and stressed the need to continue to share good practice on developing key competences within their lifelong learning strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/6">There followed a policy debate on the establishment of a European Indicator of Language Competence. The presidency noted that conclusions on this issue would be tabled at the May council. All delegations welcomed the Commission's initiative of taking forward the commitment made by heads of state and government in Barcelona in 2002 to establishing the indicator and agreed to set up an advisory board composed of member states' representatives and experts (including from the Council of Europe) in order to take forward developmental work. UK (Anne Lambert) agreed that more information on practical and financial implications is needed before member states can work on implementation. Ministers were also asked to give their views about the level of testing and the languages to be tested. There was a consensus towards testing at the end of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) Level 2 (lower secondary education, equivalent to age 14 in the UK), which is favoured by the UK. Most member states agreed with the presidency's suggestion of testing only those official languages of the Union most widely taught in the first survey round, but the majority took the view that member states should be free to choose which of those languages to test in their country. The UK tabled a position paper in reply to the presidency questions, which also stated a preference of a flexible window 2009&ndash;11 to be agreed for when the first tests would take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/7">Under any other business the commission presented its communications on &quot;Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: Fostering entrepreneurial mindsets through education and learning&quot; and &quot;Developing a knowledge flagship: the European Institute of Technology&quot;. Ms van der Hoeven, Netherlands Minister of Education, also presented plans for a Euroskills competition in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/8">During lunch, Ministers discussed the Commission's communication &quot;A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism&quot; and outlined their national strategies. For most, English was the key foreign language essential to give people entry into the world of work. But several also felt that learning two foreign languages is essential for multilingualism.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/9">At the Youth Council after lunch:</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/10">Ministers discussed the youth aspects of the Commission's annual progress report on the Lisbon strategy <i>Time to Move Up a Gear</i>, and adopted council conclusions on the implementation of the European Pact for Youth. These conclusions will be sent to the spring European council as a contribution towards the Lisbon strategy. Ministers emphasised the importance of the youth pact in developing a coordinated approach to policies for young people in the context of the Lisbon strategy. Ministers found the pact to be a useful initiative, highlighting the specific problems faced by young people (for example in terms of access to the labour market) and the importance of a quality education and information for increasing their opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/11">Ministers also agreed that the open method of co-ordination in the field of youth should be pursued at European level so that they could continue to exchange good practice and information. They stressed the importance of engaging young people actively in the development and implementation of policies that affect them.</p>
