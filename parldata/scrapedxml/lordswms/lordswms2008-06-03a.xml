	Burma: Cyclone Nargis
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-06-03a.9.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100812" speakername="Lord Tunnicliffe" colon=":" colnum="9"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80603-wms0001.htm#80603-wms0001.htm_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.9.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/2">A month has passed since Cyclone Nargis hit Burma on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>. While access has improved, the situation remains extremely grave. The UN continues to estimate that 2.4 million people have been directly affected by the cyclone and only 1 million of those have so far received any form of relief. Most of those who have been reached are in the most accessible and least badly affected regions. The official Burmese death toll is 78,000 and 56,000 missing. The threat of further deaths from infectious diseases and malaria is significant. Priority needs are food, shelter, clean drinking water and medical supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/3">The delivery of relief goods is increasing. The UN air-bridge between Bangkok and Rangoon is operating. We estimate a total of 237 flights have arrived since the cyclone struck. The first of nine World Food Programme helicopters is now delivering aid supplies to the delta region.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/4">The UK Government's priority has been, and remains, to ensure that relief reaches those who need it most. To this end, I attended the UN/ASEAN conference in Rangoon on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-25">25 May</phrase> at the personal invitation of the UN Secretary-General. The conference confirmed the importance of international aid workers being given necessary access to affected areas and the key role to be played by the ASEAN nations in facilitating the international relief effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/5">Since the conference there has been some improvement in access. No visas have been refused to UN or international NGO personnel in the past seven days. The Myanmar Red Cross has been able to scale up its operations substantially in the delta. Five international medical teams from countries in the region are now providing support to national healthcare staff in the delta. A DfID team managed to travel to the Irrawaddy delta on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-29">29 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/6">However, significant concerns remain. Visa extensions are being granted for only one or two weeks at a time; there have been restrictions on dates of travel and requirements that government liaison officers accompany relief staff. There are still too few relief workers based in the delta.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/7">The UK remains the largest single donor to the relief effort. We have contributed &pound;7 million to the UN Flash Appeal; we have also channelled &pound;6.7 million through international NGOs, including Merlin, MSF Holland and Save the Children. Our humanitarian team, which has been operating in Rangoon for three weeks, continues to play a crucial role in helping coordinate the overall aid operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/8">A total of 20 DfID-funded aid flights have now arrived in Rangoon, delivering plastic sheeting and blankets for 250,000 people, hygiene kits and flat-bottomed boats for use in the delta. All these items have been consigned to the UN, NGOs and the Red Cross. We are also transporting 162,000 mosquito nets into Burma.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/9">In addition to our previous commitment of &pound;17 million, I am today announcing a further &pound;10.5 million, bringing our total contribution to &pound;27.5 million. These additional funds will be channelled through the Red Cross, NGOs and local community-based organisations. As before, none of the UK's assistance will go through the Burmese regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/10">While the Government's immediate focus is to provide immediate assistance to those affected by the Cyclone, this does not diminish our commitment to the restoration of accountable, democratic Government in Burma. It is an indictment of the Burmese regime that they proceeded with their constitutional referendum in the immediate aftermath of this natural disaster. The official results lack all credibility. I am also disappointed and saddened that the Government have once again ignored the international community and extended Aung San Suu Kyi's detention on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-27">27 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/11">Millions of people remain in desperate need. Our priority remains to get assistance to those that need it. To do so, the regime's promises to the UN Secretary General must be turned into action. Together with the UN, ASEAN and NGOs, the UK Government will be monitoring the situation closely in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

	Communities: Extremism

	<p pid="a.10.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Jacqui Smith) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/2">Local communities working in partnership with their local authorities, police, education institutions, and others are at the heart of stopping people becoming or supporting violent extremists. Today my right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears), the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls), the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham), the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills (John Denham), the Secretary of State for Justice (Jack Straw) and I have published detailed guidance to organisations actively to assist them with their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/3">This guidance is supported by activity and funding from across government, including &pound;12.5 million to be spent to counter violent extremism and identify and support those individuals at risk across a range of key sectors, including in prisons, among youth offenders, and through community and police-led projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/4">Our aim is to improve the long-term security of the United Kingdom. This work complements the action that the security agencies are taking to disrupt those who represent an imminent threat. Along with <I>The Prevent Strategy: Stopping People Becoming or Supporting Terrorists and Violent Extremism, a Guide for Local Partners </I>we are also publishing<I></I><I>Preventing Violent Extremism: A Strategy for Delivery</I>, which summarises the strategic framework and key priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Consumer Affairs (Gareth Thomas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.1/2">Further to the Answer I gave the honourable Member for Fareham on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February 2008</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 381W), we said that the costs incurred in setting up the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform were &pound;218,063. These costs included stationery, rebranding and IT changes, including revised e-mail addresses, new signage, web-based changes, new logo and print costs and the anticipated cost of branding guidelines. This figure is also quoted in the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">26 November 2007</phrase> from Gareth Thomas, to the honourable Member for Richmond Park. A copy of this letter was placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.1/3">Those costs included an estimate of &pound;24,000 for the costs of producing branding guidelines, which had not been completed at the time. These branding guidelines have subsequently been completed: the final costs were &pound;20,000. Therefore, the final total costs are &pound;214,063.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.1/4">My noble friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business and Competitiveness is today answering a Written Question from Lord Barnett which updates the original costs as above.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education (Bill Rammell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/2">I represented the UK at Education Council, on behalf of DIUS and DCSF.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/3">Ministers adopted conclusions on multilingualism, noting that the Commission would produce a policy framework on this issue in the autumn. Ministers also adopted conclusions on adult learning that set out specific measures to be undertaken in this area by the Commission and the member states between 2008 and 2010. The text of the conclusions is in line with UK national priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/4">The council agreed a general approach on the European Year of Creativity and Innovation in 2009. I stated that the UK supported the year but queried whether matched funding would be available for member states to undertake events as part of this initiative. The Commission confirmed that project funding would come from existing EU programmes. Ministers also discussed and adopted conclusions on promoting creativity and innovation through education and training. We strongly support these conclusions which note the importance of creativity and innovation for reaching Lisbon targets, and the need to develop innovative capacity in children from an early age.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/5">The presidency provided an update on the decision to extend the Erasmus Mundus programme beyond 2009. The European Parliament is currently discussing this dossier, and the French presidency will take this forward with a view to reaching a First Reading agreement in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/6">The presidency noted the state of play between the council and Parliament in the recast decision setting up the European Training Foundation. The Parliament has now rejected the council's position regarding the composition of the foundation's governing board, so this dossier is likely to progress to a Second Reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/7">The Commission presented its proposals for two recommendations in the area of European vocational education and training, (i) a credit system and (ii) a quality assurance reference framework. These two proposals have recently been the subject of Explanatory Memoranda from the Government and will be subject to discussion by officials, with the aim of Ministers reaching an agreement at the next Education Council in November.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.3/8">The French Minister presented France's presidency priorities in the field of education: lifelong learning, enhanced co-operation in European vocational education and training, and youth mobility.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.1/13">I said that ifa pro-European Government were formed in Serbia, we would clearly want to sustain our commitment to that country's European path. But we would also need to be clear about our expectations of that government.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.1/21">The Government welcome these conclusions, and in particular Ministers' decision to expand the EU police training mission (EUPOL COPPS) in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/22"><I>WTO/DDA</I></p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/23">Commissioner Mandelson updated Ministers on the Doha development agenda (DDA).

We also called upon EU partners to support the Commission's efforts to negotiate a successful outcome for the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/24"><I>Iraq</I></p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/25">Sweden briefed Ministers on the international compact with Iraq (ICI) conference in Stockholm on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-29">29 May</phrase>, which the council welcomed as a reflection of the EU's commitment to support Iraq.

	<p pid="a.12.1/29">I said that it was important for the EU to make clear its commitment to Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.1/34">I emphasised the need for closer EU-NATO co-operation on the ground, and for the Paris conference on Afghanistan to deliver, along with a commitment from the Afghan Government to take responsibility for its own development, a commitment from the international community that it would support this by delivering assistance in support of the Afghan Government's national development strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/35"><I>Children and Armed Conflict</I></p>

	<p pid="a.17.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/2">The Government launched on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-29">29 May 2008</phrase> a consultation exercise on the National Health Service carbon reduction strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/3">The NHS is Europe's largest employer with 1.3 million people; 5 per cent of the United Kingdom workforce and is often the largest single employer in each of the regions of England. Given its size, the NHS in England is responsible for nearly 3 per cent of UK carbon dioxide emissions and 30 per cent of public sector emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/4">In the 10 years from 1990 to 2000, the NHS successfully reduced its building energy use by 20 per cent. As part of the Government's climate change programme 1998-99, some early targets on NHS carbon reduction from building energy use were set for NHS trusts to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/5">The NHS has already made good progress, but there is still much to be done. In the 10 years from 1990 to 2000, the NHS successfully reduced its building energy use by 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/6">The strategy recognises that the NHS has done much good work in increasing its sustainability. But also recognises that much more can be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/7">The purpose of the strategy is to:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/8">increase understanding about the NHS contribution to climate change and the immediate and long-term benefits to healthcare that can be gained from actively managing carbon emissions;establish board level leadership on carbon reduction in the NHS;establish stretching, but achievable, measures for carbon reduction; describe proposed national, regional and local action to support carbon reduction; give practical, evidence-based, and systematic advice on the means to improve the sustainability of NHS operations by evaluating and sharing good practice;provide a framework to monitor, evaluate and report progress; andensure policy promotes a low carbon NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/9">The core of this strategy is action. It has highlighted the 10 achievable, practical and sustainability improving, actions, to win the top 10 actions that the NHS will challenge themselves to achieve:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/10">the use of high quality information to help predict different possible trajectories of NHS carbon emissions (an NHS carbon model) to measure progress towards objectives, identify milestones, and guide action;a board approved carbon management strategy for all NHS organisations by 2009; a proposed extension of the energy fund to improve energy efficiency of the existing NHS estate;all our new buildings to be low carbon by 2015 and meet our ambition of zero carbon by 2018;a board approved sustainable travel plan for all NHS bodies by 2010;a target for better waste management to be created and met;sources of carbon emissions to be cut by improving procurement of goods, services and equipment;the pricing of carbon at an appropriate level within the NHS in England; the development and implementation of more effective incentives and policies to support and stimulate real progress on sustainable development; andall NHS organisations to report annually on a key metric as a part of a simple scorecard of sustainable development indicators, to be considered for performance purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/11">The strategy is the first product of the new NHS Sustainable Development Unit. It forms the first step of a sustainable development programme for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/12">Based on the feedback from the consultation responses, expected by <phrase class="date" code="">21 August</phrase>, it is intended that the strategy will be published in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Tom Harris) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/2">I have today launched a public consultation on proposals to extend the scope of the Railway Heritage Committee. The public consultation, which will run until <phrase class="date" code="">5 September 2008</phrase>, identifies three options to enable the committee to extend its scope to railway related bodies that were overlooked or not in existence at the time of the original legislation. These options are:</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/3">for legislation to remain the same;for railway related bodies to voluntarily agree to allow the committee to designate their records and artefacts, or to add further organisations to the original list of bodies covered by the 1996 Railway Heritage Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/4">From previous discussions between the committee and railway bodies, and a response to an informal questionnaire in March, there is a need for such bodies to be brought into the scope of the committee to enable it to fully meet its statutory obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/5">The consultation also seeks to update its membership to enable it to appoint an archivist. Current legislation restricts the department's ability to attract suitable candidates and appoint members who do not meet the existing requirements of the Public Records Act 1958.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/6">Copies of the consultation have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/2">The Transport Research Laboratory has today published a report, commissioned by my department, on the subject of longer and heavier goods vehicles (LHVs). The report highlights a number of issues that make the implementation of large 25.25 metre LHVs, sometimes referred to as super-lorries, impractical either on a permanent or trial basis. I will therefore not be allowing them on UK roads for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/3">The following issues highlighted in the report have been influential in arriving at my decision:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/4">there is a risk (substantial in the case of 60 tonne super-lorries) of increased CO2 emissions and other environmental drawbacks due to modal shift from rail to road if these vehicles were to be permitted, which would also impact on the viability of existing rail freight services and the potential for future growth;there are serious implications for the management of the road network, as such vehicles would be unsuitable for many roads and junctions;substantial investment (in the order of several billion pounds) would be needed to provide for junction improvements, the protection of bridge supports, and the provision of parking infrastructure for statutory rest periods, particularly if a new nationwide network of dedicated facilities is required; there is uncertainty about how efficiently such vehicles could be used, particularly when sourcing loads of sufficient size to make return journeys sustainable;such vehicles would introduce new safety risks; and it is not currently possible for us to mandate tougher safety or manoeuvrability standards that might address some of these issues because of European trade rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/5">The report does show, however, that there could be worthwhile benefits from permitting a modest increase in the length of current articulated vehicles. The department will consider these further in the context of its ongoing strategic work on freight, on which I expect to publish a summary of progress this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/6">The report will help to inform member states and the European Commission which are reviewing the rules on lorry sizes as part of the logistics action plan to improve the efficiency of transport and logistics in the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/7">Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House and can also be viewed at <a href="http://www.trl.co.uk">www.trl.co.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.1/4">In the report Mrs Costelloe Baker comments &quot;UKvisas has managed a huge programme of business change, holding on to principles of fairness and good service in the face of a strong 'controls' agenda. It sets itself high standards and deserves the praise and awards it receives for its successes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/5">Mrs Costelloe Baker also makes a number of constructive recommendations as to how the UK Border Agency can continue to improve the quality of decision-making, customer service and complaint handling. The UK Border Agency welcomes these comments and is keen to use these recommendations to drive up the quality of its service to customers while maintaining a high level of immigration control.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.1/8">leadership, across the public and third sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/9">The strategy will build on existing best practice and build partnerships for sustained involvement of volunteers through an increasingly diverse range of services in statutory and non-statutory settings. It will provide the basis for more coherent national investment by the department, to improve the strategic impact of volunteering, for the benefit of patients, carers and service users.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/10">The consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="">30 September 2008</phrase>, with a view to my department setting out a final strategy and implementation plan early in 2009.</p>
