	Worker Registration Scheme: Accession Monitoring Report
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-06b.23.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="23"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050606/text/50606-28.htm#50606-28_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.23.3/1">Today we are publishing the third accession monitoring report showing provisional management information from the Worker Registration Scheme and data from government monitoring of benefits, housing and national insurance number applications for the period <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. The report is available electronically on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffce.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession-monitoring.html">www.ind.homeoffce.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession&mdash;monitoring.html</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/2">Also today, as part of the Government's commitment to monitor the impact of workers from eight of the new EU member states on the UK labour market, the Department for Work and Pensions is publishing early evidence of the impact of the free movement of workers from central and eastern Europe on the UK labour market. The report is available at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/wp18.pdf">www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/wp18.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/3">The evidence confirms earlier indications that the Government's decision to allow individuals from the new member states to work in the UK has been largely beneficial to the UK economy. We estimate that workers from the new EU member states contributed approximately &pound;500 million to UK GDP between May 2004 and March 2005. New EU citizens continue to register employment throughout the UK, easing employer recruitment difficulties and helping to address labour shortages in key sectors. The number of people from the new member states seeking benefits remains exceptionally low. There appears to have been a significant reduction in illegal working among accession nationals, and an increase in employment and output in the sectors in which these workers are located, with minimal impact on resident workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/4">In total 176,000 workers from the new member states applied to the worker registration scheme between <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-01">1 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, of whom up to a third (59,000) were already in the UK before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. The level of applications has fallen since the peak in June and July 2004. Many workers only remain for short periods of time. A recent survey commissioned by the recruitment firm Manpower found that of employers who had taken on workers from the new member states half had workers who had subsequently left their employment. On average, workers who had left were employed for between three and four months. In future the e-borders programme will allow us to monitor people leaving and entering the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/5">The accession monitoring report shows that workers from the new member states are continuing to find jobs in sectors where there are a high number of vacancies. For example, 8 per cent of workers registered in the manufacturing sector, which according to the latest ONS vacancy survey had over 628,900 vacancies in the quarter ending April 2005. Significantly, there is evidence from the most recent labour force survey that demand for labour is still outstripping supply in certain sectors, despite the fact that high percentages of new EU nationals are registered as working in these industries.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/6">Since enlargement of the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, macro-economic conditions in the UK remain robust and the UK labour market continues to perform well. Individuals from the new member states make up just over 0.4 per cent of the total working age population, and there is little evidence of widespread impacts on employment, unemployment or wages. UK employment currently stands at 74.9 per cent, unchanged from 12 months ago. In March 2005 the average earnings index, excluding bonuses, was up 4.6 per cent on the year, unchanged from May 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/7">The early evidence from the <i>Impact of the Free Movement of Workers</i> study suggests that overall the effect of EU enlargement on the UK labour market has been broadly positive, reflecting the flexibility and speed of adjustment of the UK labour market. The employment rate of individuals from the eight new member states has increased substantially&mdash;from under 60 per cent in 2003 to over 75 per cent by the end of 2004&mdash;while employment has continued to rise to record levels for both the domestic population and other foreign born nationals. In particular, employment has grown significantly in the agriculture and fishing sector. There is some early, mixed evidence that wage inflation in this sector has been lower than in the rest of the economy; further analysis will be necessary to confirm this finding. There are some early suggestions from the analysis that employment of workers from the new member states has led to small localised increases in the claimant unemployment count. However these are preliminary findings, of small magnitude and are expected to be a short term effect. Further analysis will be undertaken to test these findings the effects will continue to be monitored closely over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/8">All the evidence from the accession monitoring report continues to reinforce earlier suggestions that individuals from the new member states are coming to the UK for the opportunity to work, not to claim benefits. Over 98 per cent of applications for national insurance numbers made by individuals from the new member states between <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> were for employment purposes. Very few are receiving out of work support or housing and homelessness assistance. For example, between May 2004 and March 2005 there were 1,191 applications for income support, job seeker's allowance and state pension credit, and of these fewer than 40 were allowed to go forward for further consideration. Over the same period there have been just 43 local authority lettings to tenants from the eight new member states and only 216 people were accepted for assistance under the homelessness legislation. The vast majority of recipients (70 per cent and 80 per cent respectively) were in the UK before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. Registered workers continue to be young (82 per cent were aged 18 to 34) and only 2 per cent of registered workers had dependants under the age of 17 living with them in the UK. This profile reinforces earlier evidence that the usage of hospital and education services by accession nationals is low.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/9">The next set of figures, incorporating the second quarter of 2005 (April to June 2005), will be published in August.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.9/3">Following on from announcements made in the July 2004 Defence White Paper, the Royal Navy has considered how best to reorganise mine countermeasures squadrons to deliver the operational capabilities required in the future. Due to: the variations in the types of sonar on the two classes; the requirement for some HUNTs, which can be used for fishery protection duties, to be co-located with the Fishery Protection Squadron in Portsmouth; and because we wish to cause the minimum amount of disruption to individuals, it has been decided that the best long-term option will be provided by the formation of two single-class squadrons. This means that, in the future, all eight HUNT class vessels will be based in Portsmouth whilst all eight SANDOWN class vessels will be based in Scotland (Faslane). The changes required to achieve this will be complete by March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.9/4">Some 150 or so personnel are involved. For them and their families this change provides an opportunity to introduce long-term stability. No personnel will be made redundant as a result of the changes in basing arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.11/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland (David Hanson) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.11/2">During 2004, on the basis of proposals for the reform of fraud law in England and Wales my predecessor, the right honourable John Spellar MP, commissioned a public consultation exercise on similar reforms in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland legislation on fraud generally mirrors the legislation in England and Wales and the Government took the view that there would be considerable benefit in maintaining a consistent approach across both jurisdictions. The consultations in both jurisdictions produced broadly similar responses.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.11/3">Today, I am pleased to announce the publication of the Government's response to consultation in Northern Ireland on the reform of the law on fraud. I am also pleased to announce my decision that the draft Fraud Bill, as introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-25">25 May</phrase> in the House of Lords, will extend to Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.11/4">The Government's proposals reflect the widespread public support for the proposed draft legislation across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is vital that police and prosecutors have a modern legislative framework to deal with fraud which will make the prosecution process simpler and more efficient for both juries and defendants. The reforms proposed in the draft Bill will make the law more relevant and effective in tackling the wide range of fraudulent activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.11/5">I have placed copies of the Government's response to the public consultation in Northern Ireland in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.13/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Shaun Woodward) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/2">The 2004 Spending Review settlement required the Northern Ireland Prison Service to commission an independent review of its strategy for reducing unit costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/3">The review was led by Hamish Hamill, the retired Head of the Scottish Justice Department who was assisted by Michael Cook, governor of HM Prison The Verne and Gary Law, unit manager of HM Prison Edinburgh. I am very grateful to them for their report which makes five principal recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/4" class="italic">Recommendation 1</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/5">The key target for NIPS should be to reduce its costs per prisoner place in real terms year-on-year by an agreed amount that is valid in the Northern Ireland context.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/6" class="italic">Recommendation 2</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/7">A wider review of the prisons estate is urgently required to inform long-term investment decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/8" class="italic">Recommendation 3</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/9">NIPS should urgently explore the option of contracting out the full range of escort services in preference to reactivating prisoner custody officer recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/10" class="italic">Recommendation 4</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/11">A better understanding between management and staff representatives should offer quick wins for both sides and must be a top priority for the new director general.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/12" class="italic">Recommendation 5</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/13">The development of an enhanced model to assist in the provision of regular forecasts of the prisoner population, taking account of the range of relevant criminal justice system variables, should be given greater priority than it has had until now.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/14">The Government accept the report's recommendations which, when taken together with the service's efficiency programme, represent a comprehensive programme of work.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/15">To take the report's recommendations forward, I have asked Robin Masefield, the director general of the service, to prepare a strategic development plan aimed at drawing up the blueprint for the long-term development of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/16">The terms of reference for the work to develop the prison service strategic development plan are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/17">This study will draw up the blueprint for the long-term development of the Northern Ireland Prison Service. It will create a firm platform for the service's estate strategy and value-for-money investment decisions in relation to accommodation, facilities and services for prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/18">The study will build on the earlier estate strategy review completed in 2002 which concluded that Northern Ireland required three separate establishments. It is not intended to challenge that particular assumption, but the study will take account of:</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/19" class="indent">(a) potential changes in the prisoner population over the next 10-15 years and the foreseen operational needs of the service;</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/20" class="indent">(b) the current condition of the NIPS estate and the NIPS estate strategy review completed in 2002 where still relevant;</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/21" class="indent">(c) work in progress to clarify the role of individual establishments e.g. the review of the regime for life sentence prisoners;</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/22" class="indent">(d) the approach to the private sector in prison services in Great Britain and the potential for reductions in the cost to the taxpayer;</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/23" class="indent">(e) the comparative risks to deliverability of public and private sector operations, in the Northern Ireland context;</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/24" class="indent">(f) other relevant factors, including likely timescales, the merits of alternative locations for prisoners in Northern Ireland, and the employment effects in the north-west;</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/25" class="indent">(g) affordability; and</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/26" class="indent">(h) the service's current efficiency programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/27">The study is to take note of all other relevant evidence, including the recent report of the independent review led by Hamish Hamill and reports based on the concept of a healthy prison by the inspectorates in relation to both Magilligan and Hydebank Wood.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/28">The work will consist of a number of strands taken forward under the oversight of a central steering group. Trade union and staff association representatives will be consulted fully during the study.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/29">The main output from the review i.e. the service's strategic development plan, is to be completed before the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.13/30">I have placed copies of the Hamill report in the Libraries of both Houses</p>

	Tax Credits: Overpayments
</major-heading>

	<p pid="b.25.21/1">The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/2">Today over six million families and 10 million children are benefiting from tax credits. The tax credits introduced in April 2003 are more generous and more inclusive than any previous system of income-based financial support.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/3">The introduction of a system of tax credits has been a huge undertaking. For the vast majority of families the new system is working well, providing important advantages over previous systems of support. In particular, the new system is more responsive than previous &quot;snapshot&quot; systems; it allows awards to be adjusted in-year when a family's income or other circumstances change.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/4">I am determined that the tax credit system will do the job it was designed for&mdash;to deliver to all families the financial support they are entitled to, providing the right amount of support at the right time. However, at the point when the new tax credits were introduced, problems arose affecting a small proportion of families. Many Members have raised specific cases with me and there has been much discussion and debate in the House, most recently in the Westminster Hall debate that I was unfortunately unable to attend due to illness. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to provide the House with an update on the steps that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is taking to address these problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/5">It is now well known that in the early months of 2003&ndash;04 the Inland Revenue encountered serious problems with the new IT system, resulting in overpayments and other difficulties. Some families have also found the information provided to them on the status of their awards unclear, which has made the process more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/6">In response to these challenges I have agreed with David Varney, the Chairman of HMRC, that HMRC will take a series of important steps to improve the administration of tax credits. The department has been working hard with its new IT contractor to improve the performance of the tax credits IT system. The accuracy with which tax credits information is processed is improving. Officials have been working closely with representative bodies, for example, to improve the clarity of the information provided to families on their tax credit awards. Further, new streamlined procedures have been introduced to decide cases where the recovery of an overpayment is disputed.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/7">These are all important steps forward but there remain key challenges for the department in delivering tax credits. I am therefore setting out six measures to improve significantly the tax credits system, with particular regard to:</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/8" class="indent">i. how the department communicates with families about their tax credit award;</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/9" class="indent">ii. reducing the risk of errors adding to the number of overpayments; and</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/10" class="indent">iii. improving procedures for recovering overpayments.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/11" class="indent">1. Building on the work already undertaken to improve the clarity of the tax credit award notice and in consultation with the voluntary sector, HMRC will review the effectiveness of information provided to claimants, to support them in understanding the responsive nature of the tax credit system and the risk of overpayments. In particular the department will develop solutions to reduce the number of cases where people receive unnecessary duplication of award notices.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/12" class="indent">2. HMRC will test out new methods of reminding tax credit claimants of the importance of providing up to date information in-year on changes in their income and circumstances. The department will consider options to identify families most at risk of an overpayment and support them through better targeted contacts to ensure their stated circumstances and income are up to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/13" class="indent">3. HMRC will develop options to improve the quality of service on the helpline, in particular to ensure that helpline operators can track the progress of individual cases in the system, reducing the need for families to contact the helpline on multiple occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/14" class="indent">4. HMRC will improve the speed with which it identifies IT system problems and processing errors so that they can be resolved more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/15" class="indent">5. Tax credits are working well for millions of families but the system is new and requires active engagement from claimants. The role of the voluntary sector in providing advice to families receiving tax credits is crucial. I have asked HMRC to develop innovative ways of working with the sector to target more active support on vulnerable families.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.21/16" class="indent">6. HMRC will review the operation of the code of practice on overpayments.
