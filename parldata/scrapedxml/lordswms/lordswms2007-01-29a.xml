	<p pid="a.1.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">I announce today the attachment of 1 Rifles to3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase>, as a 4th Manoeuvre Unit. The battalion is due to form up in February 2007 following the mergerof the Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry (DDLI) and the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry (RGBWLI).</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">The addition of a 4th Manoeuvre Unit will give3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines more robust organisational and structural depth to enable it to contribute units simultaneously to current operations and to tasks that might arise in relation to other defence objectives. The permanent nature of the 4th Manoeuvre Unit grouping will enable the development of common doctrine and procedures, thus allowing it to participate more fully in amphibious operations as a secondary assault wave. This move will enhance the capability of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and achieve increased delivery of military capability. It also reflects the desire to deepen joint relationships between the Royal Navy and Army. The Army already provides combat support within 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines in the form of 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and 59 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers, and contributes to the combat service support provided by the Commando Logistic Regiment. There are clearly wider defence benefits as we balance operational capability across defence. The 4th Manoeuvre Unit role will provide challenging and varied' opportunities for an Army light role infantry battalion in 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/4">1 Rifles will remain on the Army list under the full command of the Chief of the General Staff but serve under the operational command of the Commander in Chief Fleet and the commander of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. Regimental personnel will continue to wear the 1 RIFLES cap badge.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.1/1">My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Gordon Brown) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">The Economic and Financial Affairs Council will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase> in Brussels. The items on the agenda are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3"><I>Presidency Work Programme</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">The German presidency will introduce its ECOFIN work programme for the next six months. This item will be a televised public debate and priorities are likely to focus on core Finance Minister responsibilities such as the quality of public finances, financial services and taxation.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/5"><I>Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/6">Ministers will be invited to adopt procedural conclusions abrogating decision 2003/487/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in France in accordance with article 104(12). France's EDP procedure was started in 2003 on the basis of a deficit of 3.1 per cent in 2002. In January 2005, the council concurred with the Commission's view that 2005 was to be considered the relevant deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit. In November 2006, the Commission recommended that the council abrogate the excessive deficit procedure concerning France, since the deficit fell to 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2005 and is projected to decrease further.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/7">Preparation of the European Council (8-<phrase class="date" code="">9 March 2007</phrase>)</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/8">ECOFIN will discuss a series of items in preparation for the spring European Council. These orientation debates will cover:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/9"><I>Key Issues Paper</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/10">Ministers will hold an orientation report on the ECOFIN key issues paper, which is a set-piece document that both responds to the Commission's annual progress report on implementation of the Lisbon agenda and sets out ECOFIN's priorities on economic reform issues as a contribution to the spring European Council. This discussion will inform the drafting of the paper, which ECOFIN expects to adopt at its February meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/11"><I>Lisbon Strategy: Commission progress report</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/12">Ministers will also discuss the Commission annual progress report, which reports on the implementation of the Lisbon agenda. The Commission notes good progress across member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/13">The Commission's 2007 reform priorities for the EU as a whole are based on the four priority areas identified by the 2006 spring European Council, which correspond closely to the Hampton Court workstreams creating an innovation-friendly, modern Europe; unlocking business potential (particularly SMEs); increased adaptability of labour markets; and energy and climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/14"><I>Updating the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines 2005-08</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/15">ECOFIN will also discuss the updating of the broad economic policy guidelines for 2005-08. Together with the employment guidelines, these form the integrated guidelines, which recommend priority actions for member states. No conclusions will be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/16"><I>Reducing administrative burden: Commission reports</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/17">An orientation debate is expected on the Commission reports on reducing administrative burdens in the EU. This will provide an opportunity for Finance Ministers to discuss the Commission's &quot;Better Regulation&quot; plans and emphasise the need to make concrete progress on reducing EU administrative burdens on business.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/18"><I>Convergence reports by the Commission and the European Central Bank</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/19">The Commission and the ECB will present their December 2006 convergence reports. The reports outline the views of the ECB and the Commission on where nine countries stand against the five Maastricht criteria for euro entry. Sweden and all member states that joined in 2004 are covered, with the exception of Slovenia and Lithuania, whose assessment took place in May 2006. The UK and Denmark are not covered due to their opt-out status.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/20">Discussion is likely to be limited, as the Commission has concluded that none of the member states assessed has met all the convergence criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/21"><I>Enlargement of the euro area&mdash;Current status of Slovenia's adoption of the euro</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/22">The Commission will deliver a presentation on Slovenia s adoption of the euro. A related Commission paper considers that the introduction to the euro in Slovenia has been successful. This is expected to be a short agenda item and no conclusions are expected.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-01-29a.6.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="6"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70129-wms0001.htm#07012940000046">
	<p pid="a.6.1/1">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Paul Goggins) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-04">4 September 2006</phrase>, I launched a wide-ranging review of the effectiveness of the temporary provisions of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. This review formed part of the Secretary of State's statutory duty to have regard to progress made towards securing that membership of the police and police support staff is representative of the community in Northern Ireland and to consult with the Policing Board when making a decision as to whether these provisions should be renewed. This consultation ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-27">27 November 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/3">As a result of these temporary provisions, tremendous progress has been made during the past few years towards a more representative Police Service of Northern Ireland, with the proportion of Catholic officers in the regulars increasing from8.3 per cent in 1998 to 21.19 per cent on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-17">17 January 2007</phrase>. The number of Catholic applications to the PSNI has also been encouraging, averaging 35 per cent in each competition. Catholic representation among civilian staff also continues to rise. The percentage of directly recruited Catholic police support staff has increased from 13.76 per cent in January 2002 to 22.12 per cent on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> with the overall composition now at 16.99 per cent. There are a number of initiatives ongoing which will continue to improve this over time. An example of this is the proposed introduction of police community support officers (PCSOs) who will be civilians recruited under the 50:50 provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/4">The Government are committed to continuing to address the religious imbalance within the police service and the St Andrews agreement makes it clear that the temporary 50:50 recruitment arrangements to the PSNI will lapse when the Government's target of 30 per cent Catholic officers has been achieved. For these reasons, and after looking carefully at the responses to the consultation, the Secretary of State has now decided that those temporary provisions should be renewed for a further three years. This will enable the Government to reach their target of 30 per cent Catholic representation in PSNI by 2010-11. That is why today I am laying before Parliament the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (Renewal of Temporary Provisions) Order 2007. There will be an opportunity to debate the order in both Houses of Parliament.</p>
