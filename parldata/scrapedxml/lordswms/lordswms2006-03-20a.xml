We believe the EU should now press the UN to work towards this date as a deadline for handover.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/22" class="italic">Lebanon</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/23">The presidency has invited Lebanese Prime Minister Siniora to address the council over lunch on the current situation on the ground.</p>
