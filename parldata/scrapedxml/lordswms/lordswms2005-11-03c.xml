	Anti-social Behaviour Orders
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-03c.23.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="23"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo051103/text/51103-26.htm#51103-26_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.23.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" name="Hazel Blears">My right honourable friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Hazel Blears)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/2">I am announcing today statistics relating to anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs). An ASBO is a civil order which protects the community from behaviour that has caused or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as the perpetrator. ASBOs were introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and have been available since April 1999. ASBOs can be issued to anyone aged 10 years or over. They impose restrictions on the behaviour of individuals who have behaved in an anti-social way and protect communities from often long-standing and highly intimidating activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/3">Breach of an ASBO is a criminal offence and can lead to custody. The maximum penalty for breach of an ASBO is five years' imprisonment or a fine of up to &pound;5,000 for an adult offender. Data on the number of ASBOs issued are updated quarterly. New figures for the period up to March 2005 are now available. These figures show that for the period between April 1999 and March 2005 the number of ASBOs issued (as reported to the Home Office) was 5,557. The number of ASBOs issued in the quarter January to March 2005 is 897 and represents 16 per cent of the total number of ASBOs issued over all quarters. Of those ASBOs issued, 53 per cent were to adults and 44 per cent to juveniles (3 per cent of ASBOs are age unknown); 50 per cent were orders on application and 50 per cent were orders on conviction.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/4">The Home Office is notified by courts of ASBOs issued. However, evidence is emerging of some under-reporting of the number of ASBOs issued. The courts are requested to provide the Home Office with statistical information concerning all ASBOs. This has not happened in all cases, and the Home Office is currently working with Her Majesty's Courts Service to address this under-reporting. A new single standard IT system (LIBRA) is planned to be implemented in all magistrates' courts during 2006 onwards and this will improve the quality and timeliness of data. Where data are not currently reported by the courts on time, data for previous quarters are reconciled to take account of any late court returns.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/5">I have placed in the House Library a briefing note containing information about ASBOs and the ASBO statistics issued today.</p>

	Company Law Reform

	<p pid="c.24.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" name="Alun Michael">My right honourable friend the Minister for Industry and the Regions (Alun Michael)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/2"><i>Government Statement following the White Paper and related consultations</i> The Government are very grateful for the continuing involvement of the whole range of interested parties in the development of the Company Law Reform Bill. Development of the Bill has proceeded on as consultative a basis as possible throughout, and has relied crucially on the close involvement of a wide range of businesses, business organisations and other individuals and bodies.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/3">Publication of the White Paper <i>Company Law Reform</i> in March this year was a key stage. The White Paper set out the Government's policy proposals in almost all areas of the Bill, and included draft clauses in many of these areas. Many further clauses were subsequently published on the website, along with further explanatory material, including a Government Statement published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/4">Consultation has revealed continued broad support for the underlying thrust of the Bill, and for the great majority of the specific policies within it. Many comments of detail were received on the draft clauses. The Bill as introduced takes account of these comments and benefits very significantly from the suggestions made.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/5">The full range of the Government's proposals are now set out in the Company Law Reform Bill, introduced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>. This Statement sets out the main areas where, in the light of the consultation process or of other recent developments, the Government have made more substantial policy decisions in key areas since July.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/6"><i>Directors' duties</i> There were many detailed and helpful responses on the proposed statutory statement of directors' duties. In the light of those responses, the Government have decided:</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/7" class="indent">that it is still fully committed to an approach based on &quot;enlightened shareholder value&quot;, but wants to ensure that this adequately reflects wider expectations of responsible business behaviour. The duty to promote the success of the company will therefore place greater emphasis on the long-term consequences of business decisions, and on the need for directors to take account of factors such as the interests of employees and the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment so far as reasonably practicable;</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/8" class="indent">to make it clearer that the statutory statement is (with two exceptions in respect of the duties on conflicts of interest) a &quot;codification&quot; of the current law and does not change the current position on authorisation;</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/9" class="indent">to make it clearer that most of the duties continue to be fiduciary. This is important in respect of the remedies for breach of the duties; and</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/10" class="indent">to make it clear that the clauses on directors' liabilities change the law on ratification so that the necessary majority to ratify a wrong has to be reached without the support of the wrongdoers.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/11"><i>True and fair accounts</i> It is a very clear common-sense principle that the auditor's role is to ensure that accounts give a true and fair view of the company's financial position. While some of the terminology differs, this is the aim both of our own UK company law traditions and modern international accounting standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/12">The current law reflects this basic principle. However, the statutory framework is complicated and has become more so over time, combining both UK and Community law provisions. The Government are therefore taking the opportunity in the Bill to restate Section 235 of the Companies Act to express the principle more clearly in the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/13">To underline the point, the Bill also includes a new clause providing an express duty on directors to ensure accounts give a true and fair view. We are requiring that auditors take this new duty of the directors into account when they conduct their audits, to underline the point that directors and auditors should approach the accounts with the same common-sense objective of ensuring that accounts give a true and fair view of the company's financial position.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/14" class="italic">Resolutions and meetings</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/15"><i>Minimum notice period for AGMs</i> The Government had originally proposed reducing the statutory minimum notice period to 14 days, as a simplificatory measure. But several stakeholders have commented that the original CLR recommendation may have been overtaken by EU developments. The proposed EU shareholder rights directive is currently consulting on introducing a minimum notice period of 21 &quot;business&quot; days for quoted companies AGMs.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/16">Some stakeholders have also argued that such a change could conflict with the increasingly important &quot;shareholder engagement&quot; agenda. In the light of these concerns, the Government have decided to retain the current law (21 days for AGMs and 14 days for other general meetings), at least pending further clarity at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/17"><i>Fifteen-day holding period</i> This White Paper proposal was intended to foster shareholder engagement, by giving shareholders a 15-day &quot;window&quot; where they can act upon the information disclosed in the company's annual accounts and report and lay resolutions for the general meeting. But stakeholders raised significant concerns that it might cause practical difficulties and thus impose additional costs in implementation, particularly in conjunction with our other proposal to shorten the timeline between the financial year-end and holding the AGM to six months.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/18">The Government are still keen to foster the underlying policy of shareholder engagement. The Bill will therefore ensure that shareholder resolutions requisitioned before the end of the financial year-end should still be circulated at the company's expense.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/19"><i>Institutional Investor Voting</i> The White Paper said that the Government were continuing to explore the proposal that institutional investors should disclose how their voting rights had been exercised, as had been recommended by the Company Law Review. The Government published draft clauses on this on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-14">14 October 2005</phrase>. The proposal has attracted considerable stakeholder comment with views polarised. Some consultees argue that such a mandatory disclosure regime will be costly for industry and that the benefits are unclear. Others strongly support the measure. The Government believe it is important that institutional investors take an active part in the governance of companies in which they invest and disclosing how they have voted is a helpful measure in this context. The Government would prefer disclosure to become the norm without statutory action but recognise that a voluntary approach may fail to deliver this outcome. Our approach is therefore to encourage disclosure without compulsion in the first instance but we consider that a power should be contained in the Bill against the possibility that sufficient disclosure does not take place on a voluntary basis. If it becomes necessary to exercise the power, the Government will consult fully with interested parties on any mandatory regime which might be considered, paying regard in particular to possible costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/20"><i>Offences</i> The White Paper consulted on changes to the framework of liability attaching to breaches of Companies Act requirements. These proposals attracted a good deal of comment. In particular, consultees were concerned about an apparent extension of liability beyond those officers of the company who are currently held to be liable for breaches. These comments focused on two specific White Paper proposals; namely, that the definition of &quot;officers in default&quot; should be redefined and to some extent extended more widely within the company by the use of a new definition of &quot;senior executive&quot;; and the proposed inclusion of a category of persons, &quot;responsible delegates&quot;, who would be newly liable in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/21">Concerns focused both on the desirability of the underlying policy, which many felt risked diluting the essential focus on the responsibilities of the directors themselves and on the technical difficulties of defining these new categories of persons in ways which met the overall objective of increasing clarity. The Government share these concerns, and therefore do not now propose to take forward these specific measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/22">The White Paper proposed to increase the maximum penalty for the offence of directors approving defective accounts to seven years' imprisonment; and the July consultation proposed the same maximum penalty for the new offence for auditors who knowingly or recklessly issue an incorrect audit report. Stakeholders felt that these proposed penalties were excessive, and the Government have decided to remove the threat of imprisonment for both offences, for which the maximum penalty will therefore be an unlimited fine. Serious offences can still be pursued through, for example, a prosecution for theft or false accounting, each of which carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/23"><i>Charges</i> On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-19">19 July</phrase> the Government launched a consultation seeking views on the economic impact of the recommendations of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in respect of company charges. The timing of this consultation ensured that it would be possible to include a sufficiently wide power in the forthcoming Company Law Reform Bill to enable them to be enacted if there was firm support expressed for the Law Commission's proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/24">It was clear from the consultation that there is not a consensus of support for the proposals. The Bill will therefore not include a specific power to implement charges measures but the Bill will include a new power to make company law reform orders (as discussed in the White Paper), and this will provide a mechanism for implementing certain changes in respect of company charges, on matters of company law (as against property law) if wished. The Government will continue to consider and to discuss with interested parties exactly what changes should be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/25"><i>Paper free holding and transfer of shares</i> The White Paper said that the Government would be willing in principle to include provisions in the Bill which would permit companies to stop issuing paper share certificates. Many respondents argued that only a mandatory approach would achieve cost savings and wider business benefits but they also agreed that it is too early to take a blanket approach and that more information is needed on the costs and benefits of a paper free approach. The Government believe it would be premature to take a decision on the case for a mandatory approach until there has been wider public consultation, but they do not wish to rule out the option for reform. The Bill will therefore extend the existing power relating to transfer of securities (Section 207 of the Companies Act 1989) so that it can be used either to permit or to require the paper free holding and transfer of shares.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/26"><i>UK-wide law: Northern Ireland</i> On <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-07">7 September</phrase> Angela Smith MP launched a consultation on the proposal that the new companies legislation should extend automatically to companies in Northern Ireland (as well as, as now, Great Britain). This proposal reflected the fact that legislation in Northern Ireland, though technically a separate matter, generally follows very closely the precedent of legislation in Great Britain, but with a distance in time which means that Northern Ireland companies do not generally get the advantages of new legislation until some time after their English, Welsh and Scottish counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/27">Consultation revealed substantial support for this proposal, and for the suggestion that certain other aspects of law which relate closely to company law (for example, limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships) should be legislated for on a UK-wide basis. The Bill reflects this position.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/28">Company law will remain a transferred matter, and a future Northern Ireland Assembly could decide to resume responsibility for drafting separate Northern Ireland companies legislation if it considered it desirable.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/29" qnum="2004">UKHL 9) there may be an anomaly between liquidation and administration as regards the recovery of insolvency practitioners' expenses, raising concerns about whether or not companies will be advised to follow the most appropriate form of insolvency procedure. The decision is to the effect that for companies in liquidation the payment of the general expenses of the winding up cannot be paid out of assets which are subject to a floating charge ahead of the floating charge holder.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/30">There may also be implications for both the general body of creditors and employees because floating charge holders may be attracted by the better returns that the more terminal liquidation procedure offers, as opposed to administration, which is more aimed at fostering company &quot;rescue&quot;. For these reasons, the Government will change the law to ensure that for companies in liquidation general expenses of the wind up can be paid out of assets subject to a floating charge ahead of the floating charge holder.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/31"><i>Enterprise Act</i> Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002 creates a gateway for the disclosure of information relating to specific consumer and competition matters. In addition, it creates a gateway to allow certain information to be disclosed for certain civil investigations and proceedings overseas. The current Part 9 gateways do not in general allow information to be released by public bodies to business and individuals for the purpose of civil proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.3/32">The Government launched a consultation on this area on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-23">23 August 2005</phrase>. This consultation does not close until <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-18">18 November 2005</phrase> and the Government look forward to responses. No decisions will be taken until the Government have had the opportunity to consider all such responses. However, without prejudice to the outcome of that consultation, in the event that the Government were to decide that some relaxation of the gateways was appropriate, it would be necessary to provide some legislative route to implement the specific measure. The Bill will therefore include a power for the Secretary of State to prescribe through secondary legislation circumstances in which such disclosures might be made.</p>

	Compensation Bill
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-03c.29.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="29"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo051103/text/51103-28.htm#51103-28_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.29.1/1">The Compensation Bill has been published today.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/2">The Bill will provide better safeguards for consumers of claims management services and will reassure those concerned about possible litigation that the law of negligence takes the social value of activities into account and that they will not be found liable if they adopt reasonable standards and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/3">The Bill sets out the proposed legislative framework for the regulation of claims management services to provide effective protection for consumers and to tackle the bad practices that have been a common feature of the claims management sector. Regulation will be applied initially to areas where consumers are most at risk&mdash;personal injury, criminal injuries compensation, employment, housing disrepair and claims for redress in relation to the mis-selling of financial products such as endowment policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/4">The Bill will provide for regulation that is effective, proportionate to the risk involved, and creates the minimum burden necessary. The Bill will deliver a level playing field of consumer protection so that whomever a consumer seeks advice and assistance from they can expect a quality service and proper mechanism for redress if a problem arises.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/5">The Bill will make it an offence for claims management services to be provided by persons who are not authorised under the new regulatory regime or who are not already fully regulated by another regulator such as the Law Society or the Financial Services Authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/6">The Bill will provide for the Secretary of State to appoint or establish a body to regulate the claims management sector. Regulatory responsibility will be given only to a body that is competent, has appropriate governance and other management arrangements in place and will provide benefits to consumers. If no suitable body can be appointed or established, the Secretary of State will regulate directly.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/7">The Bill's provision on negligence reflects recent judgments of the higher courts. It makes clear that when considering a claim in negligence, in deciding what is required to meet the standard of care in particular circumstances, a court is able to consider the wider social value of the activity in the context of which the injury or damage occurred. It provides that the court can have regard to whether requiring particular steps to be taken to meet the standard of care might prevent a desirable activity from being undertaken or might discourage people involved in providing the activity from doing so.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/8">The Bill forms part of a wider programme of work which is being taken forward across government and, in partnership with stakeholders, to tackle perceptions that can lead to a disproportionate fear of litigation and risk averse behaviour, to find ways to discourage and resist bad claims and to improve the system for those with a valid claim for compensation.</p>

	EU Heads of State: Informal Meeting
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-03c.30.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="30"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo051103/text/51103-28.htm#51103-28_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.30.1/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/2">The purpose of the informal meeting of EU heads of state or government on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase> was to set a clear direction on how Europe responds to the challenge of globalisation. There is a strong sense in the European Union that we need to reconnect Europe with the concerns of its citizens and a strong feeling among the leaders of the EU that we have to get Europe moving in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/3">The European Commission produced a paper for the meeting&mdash;<i>European Values in the Globalised World</i>&mdash;that sets out very clearly: the challenge facing Europe; what member states should do in response; and what might most effectively be done at European level. There was broad agreement to both the analysis in the paper and its ideas on the way forward. The consensus was that while Europe sometimes needs to do more and sometimes needs to do less, in each case it needs to do it better.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/4">There was strong support for the Commission proposals to reduce the amount of regulation and to ensure that future regulation does not damage the competitiveness of the European economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/5">EU leaders discussed the Commission's proposal for a globalisation adjustment fund. This is not about bailing-out failing firms or standing in the way of globalisation, but about helping those individuals affected by change to retrain and to acquire new skills. The Commission will now develop a full proposal on this.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/6">EU leaders also agreed further work in some key areas for Europe's future competitiveness, economic prosperity and security. The Commission, the UK presidency and the incoming Austrian presidency will decide how to take work forward in the areas of:</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/7" class="indent"><i>Research and Development:</i> We need to encourage greater business and industrial investment in areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals so that Europe can have world-beating companies in the technologies of the future. And we need to look at possible new ways of supporting innovation, for example through the venture capital market or exploring the scope for increased European Investment Bank funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/8" class="indent"><i>Universities:</i> We need to find ways of raising the level of our universities, in particular by developing stronger links between universities and business.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/9" class="indent"><i>Addressing the demographic challenge:</i> We need to share practical solutions for family-friendly policies, better childcare, and work/life balance provisions. We also need to tackle barriers to the greater participation of older workers in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/10" class="indent"><i>Energy:</i> The Commission paper makes it clear that global demand is increasing while supply remains tight. We need to: diversify the sources of our energy; develop a properly integrated European grid and a genuinely open energy market; ensure a coherent and operational approach to the EU's relationship with major energy suppliers, for example Russia and OPEC; and put energy efficiency and clean technologies at the heart of our agenda.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/11">We also agreed that the Commission, building on the Hague programme, should look at further work on illegal immigration, crime and security. Taking account of recent Spanish and French ideas on tackling illegal immigration, we need to work more effectively in partnership with source and transit countries, particularly Sub-Saharan and North Africa. We shall: hold an EU-African Ministerial conference on migration issues; strengthen our border controls, including through the use of latest technology, for example biometrics; accelerate plans for a rapid reaction capability of immigration officers; and make sure that EU funding and development aid are more strategically targeted.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/12">On crime and security, we must work more effectively with countries outside the EU on Justice and Home Affairs issues, such as terrorism and human and drug trafficking. We shall develop an EU counter-terrorism strategy focused on preventing radicalisation, protecting our infrastructure and ensuring better co-operation and exchange of information so that our law enforcement can effectively pursue terrorists and respond to attacks.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/13">In these areas there will be an interim report to the December European Council, and final reports during the Austrian presidency in the first half of next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/14">Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, working with the presidency, will take forward work on the CFSP aspects of defence and security. We shall look to improve our capabilities by: increasing levels of research spending; exploiting opportunities for research collaboration; tackling capability gaps (air to air refuelling, heavy lift); and, collaborating as partners on training. We shall ensure that our crisis management structures can meet new demands on them including responding to natural disasters. We shall look to increase CFSP funding. We shall bring forward a comprehensive EU strategy for Africa in December.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/15">As presidency, the Government also made it clear that agreeing a broad direction for Europe's economic development, and some priorities for action at a Community level, would help to set the context for agreeing the next financial perspective for Europe's budget from 2007 to 2013. We shall try to reach agreement on this at the December European Council.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/16">Finally, EU Leaders agreed three statements at the meeting:</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/17" class="indent"><i>Iran:</i> We condemned in the strongest terms the comments in respect of the state of Israel attributed to President Ahmadinejad of Iran. Calls for violence, and for the destruction of any state, are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community, and raise serious concerns about Iran's role in the region and its future intentions.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/18" class="indent"><i>Syria:</i> We welcomed the report of the UN International Investigation Commission under Judge Detlev Mehlis and expressed our full support for the UN Security Council's determination to see justice done in this case.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/19" class="indent"><i>South Asian earthquake:</i> We expressed our sympathy and solidarity for all those affected by the South Asian earthquake, and pledged to do all that we can to help with this ongoing tragedy as winter approaches.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.1/20">Copies of the Commission paper and the statements have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.35.1/2">Today I am announcing that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is launching a new, rapid process for assessing drugs and other treatments. The single technology appraisal process will be used initially to produce faster guidance on life-saving drugs which have already been licensed and on new medicines close to when they first become available. This new process is in addition to NICE's standard process.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/3">NICE is starting work immediately on five topics as a first tranche. NICE will also be consulting widely on the new process over the next three months. The institute will consult organisations representing patients, healthcare professionals and the healthcare industries on the details of the new process. Comments arising from the consultation will be taken into account alongside the lessons learned from developing guidance on its first tranche.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/4">The new faster process will benefit many thousands of patients, especially those with life-threatening conditions. It will provide greater certainty about the provision of important new treatments, as well as enabling the National Health Service to plan better for the introduction of new drugs.</p>

	Railways: Security
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-11-03c.35.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="35"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo051103/text/51103-30.htm#51103-30_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.35.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Alistair Darling) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.3/2">Yesterday I informed the Transport Select Committee that I have given the go-ahead for new security techniques to be trialled on mainland rail and underground stations. The trial will begin in the new year. It will test how effective new and existing technology could be to help counter the continued terrorist threat to the UK transport network. The trial will form part of our ongoing consideration of transport security. It comes after the review of rail security following the Madrid rail attacks in March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.3/3">I informed the House of that review on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March</phrase> this year (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>WS 130</i>). It examined security measures in place and potential improvements to current systems on the UK's underground and rail networks. The review identified a package of recommendations to enhance rail counter-terrorist security. Some of these measures will be obvious to the public, others are not.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.3/4">The attacks of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase> and the continued threat from international terrorism make this work more urgent. The equipment trial I am announcing today is a further stage in this work. Transport security measures have to be proportionate and responsive. Around 3 million people travel on the London Underground network and well over 2 million people travel on the country's rail network every day. It is important that we reduce the risk to those passengers while recognising that accessibility is important to people and business.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.3/5">It is equally important that we do not ignore the benefits that new technology could provide us. Potential security benefits should not be disregarded without due consideration. We have to be ready to look at whether further action is appropriate and practical. The equipment trial I am announcing today is an important part of our considerations. It will use some currently available screening techniques on the national rail and London Underground network for the first time. It will help establish whether there are benefits in the introduction of a system of fractional screening. This is the screening of a small proportion of passengers on either a random or targeted basis using new technology or other systems available to us.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.3/6">The equipment trial will begin in the new year for four weeks on the Heathrow Express platforms at Paddington Station. Further locations for a small number of trials will be identified by my department in consultation with London Underground, Network Rail and others over the next six months. The trial will be a series of tests of screening equipment. At selected locations a small number of randomly chosen passengers will be asked to take part in the tests. This may involve either going through a scanner or being searched either by hand, with the use of portable trace equipment, or with sniffer dogs. Bags may passed through X-ray machines.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.3/7">Most techniques will be familiar to the public, especially to those who fly. However, some technology will be new. This includes the first use on the UK railway of body scanners using millimetre wave technology. This enables the operator to check for objects concealed in or under clothing. In itself the trial is not designed to be part of the current security regime. It will test the usefulness of the specialist equipment and help examine the practical issues that may affect its future use in a normal rail environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.3/8">It is not suggested that it will be possible to turn our rail or underground network into a &quot;closed&quot; system like an airport. Widespread screening, even on a fractional basis, as to be tested now, would be a huge step and not one to be taken lightly. No decision on its future use has been taken. This equipment test is essential to ensure that when it is, the decision is based on reliable evidence and experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.3/9">The trial will be followed by a period of evaluation. I will of course keep the House informed.</p>
