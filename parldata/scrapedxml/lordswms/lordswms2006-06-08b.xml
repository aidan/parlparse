<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-08b.97.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="97"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060608/text/60608-28.htm#60608-28_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.97.1/1">In recognition of the increasing importance of the FCO network in delivering our climate change goals, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Margaret Beckett) has looked again at our strategic international priorities, set out in the government White Paper <i>Active Diplomacy for a Changing World: the UK's International Priorities</i>, published in March. Climate change was covered in the White Paper and implicit in strategic priorities five and six. We believe that we need to emphasise its central importance to our international agenda by creating a new strategic priority. This will be:</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Achieving climate security by promoting a faster transition to a sustainable, low carbon global economy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/3">This wording is designed to draw attention to the outcome that the effort on climate change needs to achieve, and to underline the reality, which is not yet fully reflected in the priorities of foreign ministries worldwide, that climate change has become a core foreign policy challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/4">The Foreign Secretary is also announcing today the appointment of John Ashton as my special representative for climate change. His primary focus will be to build a stronger political foundation for international action on climate change, working to build consensus among key governmental and non-governmental actors in priority countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/5">Defra will continue to lead our international work on climate change. But the new strategic priority and John Ashton's appointment will strengthen significantly the contribution the FCO can make.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase> my honourable friend the Minister for Energy informed the Standing Committee of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill that I would undertake an urgent review of local plans to determine whether there is a problem with emerging plans that do not fully incorporate PPS22 guidance. That review has now been completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.3/3">The review has shown that in emerging new-style regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks there has been a strong take-up of the policy in PPS22 on the use of on-site renewables in new developments. For those authorities preparing new plans where an appropriate stage in plan making has been reached, 26 out of 29 surveyed have devised policies to secure on-site renewables in new developments. The majority of them have set a requirement for 10 per cent on-site renewables, where it is viable. Many of those at an earlier stage of developing their local development frameworks have not yet included PPS22 policies, although they still have time to do so. We strongly encourage them to do so. For those areas still completing old-style plans, such as unitary development plans, policies on on-site renewables are less likely to have been included.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.3/4">It is essential that all planning authorities follow this example and take account fully of the positive approach to renewables set out in PPS22 at the earliest opportunity in their plan making. In particular the Government expect all planning authorities to include policies in their development plans that require a percentage of the energy in new developments to come from on-site renewables, where it is viable. Such policies have a vital role to play in reducing emissions, through the use of carbon-neutral energy sources. Local authorities that are now updating their plans through new local development frameworks should take the opportunity to update their policies in this area. The Government's forthcoming draft planning policy statement on climate change will be an opportunity to consider further how the planning process more generally can help to combat climate change by extending the contribution of renewables from both on-site and off-site sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.3/5">A more detailed breakdown of plans that were examined for this review of PPS22 policies has been published today on the DCLG website <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1500549">www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1500549</a> and is available in the Libraries of both Houses. I have instructed my officials to write to all chief planning officers enclosing a copy of this ministerial Statement and to draw attention to the importance that the Government attach to such measures in tackling climate change.</p>

	Disability Discrimination Act
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="b.98.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.1/2">I have today laid a draft code of practice prepared by the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) before Parliament in accordance with the procedure set out in Section 53A(4) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. This draft code will replace the existing <i>Code of Practice on Rights of Access: Goods, Facilities, Services and Premises</i>, published in May 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.1/3">During the passage of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 2005 the Government said that the DRC would be issuing guidance to assist in the implementation of the new duties. The Government believe that clear and accessible advice and guidance for those with rights and responsibilities under the DDA is important. The Government therefore warmly welcome the draft revised code, which provides clear advice and guidance for those with obligations under Part 3 of the Act on how to avoid acts of disability discrimination, and to landlords and tenants on how to deal with requests by tenants for consent to make disability-related alterations to their homes to improve access for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.1/4">The draft revised code takes account of new duties in Part 3 and Part 5B of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, inserted by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005; and new duties introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006. The new duties mainly come into force from <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>. They affect: public authorities in the carrying out of their functions (other than those functions which are services and already covered by the DDA); private members clubs; and landlords and managers of rented premises in relation to reasonable adjustments and disability-related alterations to let residential premises. In preparing this code, the DRC has consulted extensively among disabled people, their organisations, landlords and the wider public.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.1/5">Subject to Parliament's approval of the draft code, the DRC proposes to issue and publish the revised code later this summer, giving those with responsibilities under the Act adequate time to read it before the new duties come into force. The Secretary of State will then provide for the new code to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>, replacing the existing code from that date.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/2">In a Written Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January 2006</phrase>, I informed the House that the UK, along with all other donors, had decided to withhold direct budget support to the Government of Ethiopia as a result of concerns about the governance and human rights situation following the elections in June last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/3">I assured the House at that time that the UK remained committed to reducing poverty in Ethiopia and that we were looking at alternative ways to support poor people. I can now inform the House that I have approved &pound;94 million for a new protection of basic services grant. Its objective is to maintain and expand basic services, such as primary schooling, basic healthcare, water supply and sanitation, and agricultural extension, in order to continue Ethiopia's slow but steady progress towards meeting the millennium development goals while promoting transparency and accountability in the delivery of these services. It is also being supported by the World Bank, whose board has just approved funding of $215 million (&pound;123 million).</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/4">The project will provide for regular financial monitoring and reporting to ensure that funds are being allocated fairly and are being used for the agreed purposes. For the first time detailed budgetary information will be provided to citizens to increase local accountability. I hope that civil society organisations will play an important role in helping citizens to understand how money in the budget is allocated and what it is used for, and in bringing those responsible to account for spending decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/5">I have also recently approved &pound;30 million for the productive safety nets programme for the current year to provide assistance to 7 million chronically food-insecure households&mdash;the poorest people in the country. This programme removes the need for the annual emergency food appeal by providing poor people with predictable and guaranteed cash and food in exchange for work on public projects such as local roads and water schemes. During my visit to Ethiopia earlier this year, I was able to see for myself the way in which this programme was providing vital assistance to poor people to enable them to build better lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/6">Improving the governance and human rights situation in Ethiopia has to be a priority for the UK. My colleagues and I continue to raise with the Government of Ethiopia the need to improve governance and human rights in the country, in the light of the criminal trial of some leading opposition, media and civil society leaders on serious charges. We have urged the Ethiopian Government to ensure that the trials are fair, transparent and speedy, and are supporting the observation of the trial by an international jurist.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.1/1">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June</phrase> in Luxembourg. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (Margaret Beckett) and the Minister for Europe (Geoff Hoon) will represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/3">General Affairs</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/4" class="italic">Preparation of the European Council on 15 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June</phrase>: Draft Conclusions</p>

	<p pid="b.100.1/7" class="italic">Enlargement (possible agenda item)</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/8">Ministers may be asked to consider the texts on the opening of first-chapter negotiations (science and research) for both Turkey and Croatia as well as the text for the EU/Turkey Association Council. The UK is keen to see language which reflects the EU's support for the UN Cyprus settlement process. The item may be taken off the agenda if agreement is reached at official level.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/9" class="italic">Migration</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/10">Spanish Foreign Minister Moratinos is expected to address the council on Spain's work to address illegal migration from west Africa. The Spanish are co-organising a regional conference with the French on migration and development in Rabat on 10 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July</phrase> to help to manage migration flows from west Africa to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/11">The UN high-level dialogue on international migration and development is also scheduled to take place in September. The UK looks forward to using this as a forum to showcase the EU's progressive record in this area and as an opportunity to identify ways to maximise the development benefits of voluntary legal migration and to minimise the risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/12" class="italic">European Union agency for fundamental rights (possible agenda item)</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/13">The council will discuss the fundamental rights agency, with a view to reaching final agreement on the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/14">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/15" class="italic">Preparation of EU/US Summit </p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/16">Preparations for the <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June</phrase> EU/US summit are ongoing, with the presidency and Commission engaging the US on the draft declaration between now and the summit. The presidency is likely to present a progress note at the council.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/17" class="italic">Relations with the Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/18">We expect discussion at the council to focus on Montenegro, relations with Serbia and possibly the transition arrangements for the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia. Draft conclusions are expected on the comprehensive review for Bosnia-Herzegovina, regional co-operation and the signature of Albania's stabilisation and association agreement, which is expected to take place in the margins of the council.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/19" class="italic">Cuba</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/20">We expect council conclusions on Cuba, reaffirming the common position, extending the suspension of the 2003 diplomatic measures and calling for greater practical support for civil society.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/21" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/22">We anticipate a short discussion of Iraq over lunch. This is likely to cover developments on the ground and ways in which the EU can continue to support the new Iraqi Government. We expect Ministers to discuss and welcome the new Commission communication on EU/Iraq engagement, which is due to be issued on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June</phrase>. The council is also expected to consider a draft European Council declaration.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/23" class="italic">Iran </p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/24">High Representative Solana and the E3 will brief on the E3+3 Foreign Ministers' meeting in Vienna on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June</phrase>, and HR Solana's subsequent visit to Tehran.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/25" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/26">The GAERC will consider the Middle East peace process declaration for the European Council. This is likely to welcome the development of the temporary international mechanism (TIM) to support Palestinian basic needs directly and both sides' commitment to negotiations. It is also likely to call on the new Palestinian Government to accept the three quartet principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/27" class="italic">World Trade Organisation</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/28">Commissioner Mandelson is expected to update the council on recent developments including the negotiations in Abu Dhabi on the EU/Gulf Co-operation Council free trade agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/29" class="italic">Sustainable Development</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/30">We expect the council to confirm political agreement of the revised EU Sustainable Development Strategy before forwarding the text to heads of state for adoption at the June European Council. The UK's aim has been to see a single coherent strategy that effectively communicates the Community's internal and external sustainable development objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/31" class="italic">AOB: International Facility for the Purchase of Medicine</p>
	<p pid="b.100.1/32">French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy is expected to raise the French proposal for an international drugs purchase facility (IDPF) which aims to lower the cost of drugs for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and to improve the availability of these drugs. In line with the UK/France communiqu&eacute; at the Paris conference on innovative finance in February, we strongly support the IDPF and will work with France on the details as co-sponsor of the initiative, including the consultation process, to ensure the effectiveness of this proposal.</p>

	<p pid="b.102.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/2">I will attend the second Transport Council of the Austrian presidency which takes place in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/3">The main items on the agenda are: the draft regulation on public service obligations in passenger transport, for which the council will attempt to achieve a political agreement; the Commission's mid-term review on road safety; the proposal for the establishment of a joint undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR); a progress report on air transport negotiations with the USA; and the draft proposals on vessel traffic monitoring and port state control.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/4">The Austrian presidency has indicated that it will be aiming for the council to reach a political agreement on the draft public service obligation (PSO) regulation. This would establish new rules for the payment of subsidy and the award of exclusive rights for public passenger transport services by rail and by road.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/5">In the negotiations to date we have secured some changes to ameliorate potentially adverse effects on UK public transport arrangements. We have also succeeded in amending the proposal in such a way as to create a more level playing field for operators and to create an environment for a further opening of the passenger transport market.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/6">However, there are still some issues to be resolved. These include, in particular, the extent to which authorities should be permitted to award contracts directly without competition and the safeguards that should be put in place to ensure operators benefiting from direct awards may not compete unfairly in competitive markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/7">At the council the Government will be prepared to support a deal if the final text on the table appears to offer a satisfactory balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/8">I expect the council to adopt a set of council conclusions welcoming progress on road safety&mdash;in particular, the publication of the Commission's mid-term review of the 2003 Road Safety Action Programme. The mid-term review indicates that progress will need to be accelerated in order to meet the EU target to halve road deaths by 2010. The conclusions also recognise that measures need to be strengthened at the appropriate level&mdash;Community or member state&mdash;to deal with particular issues. In addition, the conclusions acknowledge the role of technology, campaigns and the Road Safety Charter, and will invite the Commission to take necessary actions, including, where appropriate, making legislative proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/9">The council will also be debating council conclusions in regard to the Commission's communication on inland waterways, NAIADES (Navigation and Inland Waterway Action and Development in Europe). The conclusions agree the action programme to promote inland waterways for freight transport and comment on the detailed proposals of the recommendations contained within it. Although the communication only has limited relevance to the United Kingdom&mdash;as our inland waterways are not connected to those on the Continent&mdash;the Government recognise the potential of Europe's inland waterways to help to reduce traffic congestion and harmful effects on the environment as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/10">The presidency has proposed the signature of the transport protocol to the Alpine convention, which is an international agreement aimed at protecting the Alpine environment. The UK would in principle be prepared to support the signature but believes that the council should take account of the views of a member state that is directly affected and opposed to the protocol.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/11">There will be two substantive maritime items on the agenda. The council is expected to reach a general approach on the proposed directive amending Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system. This directive contains a number of disparate provisions including the fitting of automatic identification system (AIS) technology to fishing vessels. The Government support the presidency text of the directive, subject to achieving a satisfactory agreement on detailed points concerning the length of the fishing vessels to be fitted with AIS technology and the implementation timetable for the different categories of fishing vessels (according to their overall length).</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/12">The council will also hear a progress report from the Commission on the proposed directive on port state control which will simplify the existing much amended legislation. The proposed directive will also make for better use of limited port state control inspection resources, targeting for inspection those ships which pose the greatest risk while reducing the inspection burden on the owners/operators of quality ships. The requirements of the directive should be compatible with the outcome of the current work on targeting ships for inspection being undertaken by the Paris memorandum on port state control (which comprises EU port states plus Russia, Canada, Iceland and Norway).</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/13">The Austrian presidency expects the council to reach a general approach on the proposal to establish a joint undertaking to develop SESAR, the project for the new generation air traffic management system in Europe. The Government support the SESAR project as a key element of the single European sky. The joint undertaking will allow for an integrated approach to the development of SESAR involving all parts of the aviation industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/14">The second aviation item will see the Commission reporting on two aspects of aviation external relations&mdash;on the state of play on negotiations to agree an &quot;open skies&quot; agreement with the US, and on negotiations with Russia over the issue of Siberian overflight payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/15">The Commission will provide an oral report, expected to include the key elements of the concession contract, for the Galileo satellite navigation project. The Government will argue strongly for a robust PPP which is affordable for the Community.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/16">The most significant of the any other business items are: a report from the Commission on the implementation of the first railway package; and a report from the Commission on the extension of competence of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).</p>

	<p pid="b.104.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (David Lammy) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/2">The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to objects that they loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the object loaned. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects, or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/3">The limit on the contingent liabilities which may be incurred in relation to the Government Indemnity Scheme for non-national museums and galleries in England approved by the Treasury in May 2004 was &pound;1.2 billion. As a result of two major temporary exhibitions taking place in non-national museums and galleries and the high value of the objects included in those exhibitions, it has been necessary to temporarily increase the limit to &pound;1.74 billion, effective from June 2006 until July 2006.</p>

	London: Terrorist Attacks

	<p pid="b.105.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/2">I would like to announce that the Government are making an extra donation of &pound;2.5 million to the London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund to give assistance to bereaved and the injured victims of the <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase> London bombings.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/3">The further support is being made on a special, one-off basis in recognition of the exceptional circumstances of the London bombings, rather than under the rules of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, which would require a change to legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/4">The London Bombings Charitable Relief Fund is an independent charity set up by the Mayor of London and the British Red Cross in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. Decisions on how the money is to be distributed will be made by its trustees. The fund aims to distribute the money to the victims and bereaved as quickly as possible.</p>

	Railways: East Midlands, West Midlands and Cross Country Franchises
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-08b.105.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="105"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060608/text/60608-30.htm#60608-30_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.105.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Derek Twigg) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.3/2">I am today announcing the publication of consultation documents for the new East Midlands, West Midlands and Cross Country rail franchises. Copies of the consultation documents have been placed in the House Library and are available on the Department for Transport website at <a href="http://www.dfl.gov.uk">www.dfl.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced that three new rail franchises would be created (East Midlands, West Midlands and a new Cross Country) from four currently existing franchises (Central, Silverlink, Cross Country and Midland Mainline). The new franchises will begin operation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-11">Sunday 11 November 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.3/4">The publication of the three documents begins the formal consultation process on the service levels that the new train operators should provide. The documents are a consultation on the franchise specifications and seek views on the minimum service level that the Department for Transport (DfT) will wish to procure. This consultation and the responses received will later inform the invitation to tender (ITT) that bidders for each franchise will be asked to bid against this autumn. Bidders will have to provide the minimum service levels that the ITT sets out and will be able to propose additional services above this minimum subject to any operational constraints and affordability.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.3/5">Our aim is to ensure that all three franchises build on the recent success of current operators. Passenger numbers on Britain's railway are growing, particularly on key routes served by these new franchises. We want to see those numbers continue to grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.3/6">These new franchises are expected to meet current and future passenger demand and deliver a 2 to 5 per cent increase in the number of trains operated per day. Bidders will also be required to build on recent performance improvements, and deliver value for money for both fare and tax payers.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.3/7">The documents propose service levels that will address crowding, allow for future growth and put faster services in place on key routes. Passenger capacity will increase. On the Cross Country franchise, DfT is proposing a timetable structure that allows bidders to put forward a substantial increase in capacity on key crowded trains. The department expects bidders to propose additional carriages and longer trains on busy routes. Overall, the Cross Country network is expanding with extra stations served. In particular, the consultation documents propose service levels that further capitalise on the &pound;7.6 billion investment on the west coast main line.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.3/8">This is an important consultation that covers the provision of over 2,000 daily rail services. The consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-07">7 August 2006</phrase>. Over the coming weeks the department will be having extensive discussions with local interested stakeholders. It is important to ensure that these new franchises deliver further improvements for current and future rail passengers.</p>
