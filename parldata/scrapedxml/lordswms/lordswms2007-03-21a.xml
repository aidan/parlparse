	Cluster Munitions
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-21a.89.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="89"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70321-wms0001.htm#07032166000007">
	<p pid="a.89.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December 2006</phrase>, (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WS 1</I>) my honourable friend the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Kim Howells) set out in a Written Ministerial Statement the UK position on cluster munitions. We confirmed that we were committed to withdrawing dumb cluster munitions by the middle of the next decade. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-15">15 December 2006</phrase> the Government explained in another place (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 1727-1770) that we were examining the possibility of withdrawing dumb cluster munitions from service at an earlier date. This assessment is now complete and I am pleased to announce that we are withdrawing dumb cluster munitions from service with immediate effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/3">We have considered carefully both military and humanitarian factors, reflecting our duty both to ensure that the Armed Forces have the capabilities they need to undertake the missions we ask of them, and to strive to reduce civilian casualties to the minimum.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/4">Cluster munitions are legal weapons which have a valid role in modern warfare, particularly against an array of military targets in a defined area. However, they have also given rise to humanitarian concerns because they disperse submunitions over an area and those submunitions can have a high failure rate. Some cluster munitions address these concerns including through inbuilt self-destructing or self-deactivating mechanisms, reducing the risk of harm to civilians. Dumb cluster munitions do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/5">At the moment, our inventory includes two dumb cluster munitions: the RBL 755 aerial delivered cluster munition, and the multi-launch rocket system M26 munition. Both will be withdrawn from service immediately and disposed of. Although withdrawing them represents a theoretical risk to our operational effectiveness, until their direct replacement is in service, there is no current plan to deploy them on operations. I have decided that this is an acceptable risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/6">The types of cluster munitions we intend to retain are legitimate weapons with significant military value which, as a result of mitigating features, is not outweighed by humanitarian factors. As with all weapons, our forces' use of them will remain regulated by rules of engagement and internal scrutiny procedures designed to adhere to international law and reflect humanitarian values.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/7">As well as living up to their responsibilities under international law, this decision is part of our wider efforts to reduce civilian casualties and to press other militaries to do the same. We continue to press for wider agreement to ban dumb cluster munitions through the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) and complementary initiatives such as the Oslo Conference on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-23">23 February</phrase>, where we, alongside other nations, agreed to work towards an international ban in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.1/1">My right honourable friend the Chief Secretary (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/2">I am pleased to announce that a total of 24 bids from organisations spanning the public and third sectors have been awarded funding for projects following the ninth bidding round of the Invest to Save Budget. A total of &pound;9 million has been allocated over the three years to 2009-10 for England. The allocated sum rises to &pound;11 million to include consequential funding for the devolved Administrations. Details of the winning projects have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/3">The Invest to Save Budget (ISB), set up following the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review, provides initial funding support for projects that increase the extent of joint working between different parts of the public sector, identify innovative ways of delivering public services, and reduce the cost of delivering the services and/or improve the quality and effectiveness of services delivered to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/4">This ninth bidding round was focused on supporting innovative approaches to the delivery of local services by third sector organisations. The intention was to encourage local authorities to work in partnership with local third sector organisations to deliver services in line with local needs and priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/5">Applicants were asked to address the priority areas of:</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/6">the third sector's role in delivering public services and building fairer communities&mdash;projects that deliver cash releasing efficiencies; andprojects that address the priorities set out in their local area agreement and support their community strategy&mdash;projects that are additional to those already funded by statutory bodies and which address recognised gaps in local service provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/7">Successful projects are required to agree a detailed implementation plan, setting out how the project will be delivered. Each project must also provide six-monthly progress reports to sponsor departments and the Treasury and carry out an evaluation of the project's success once it has been completed. Wider dissemination of the good practice from completed projects is then fed back into the whole spectrum of public service providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/8">This ninth ISB bidding round allocates the remainder of the &pound;90 million awarded to the ISB in SR2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/9">More information can be found on the ISB website at <a href="http://www.isb.gov.uk">www.isb.gov.uk</a>.</p>
