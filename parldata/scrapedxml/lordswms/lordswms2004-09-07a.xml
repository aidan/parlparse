	DfID: Reducing Maternal Deaths Strategy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-09-07a.69.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040907/text/40907-50.htm#40907-50_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.69.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">Last week I published a strategy paper, <i>Reducing Maternal Deaths</i>, setting out the evidence on what is needed to reduce maternal deaths in developing countries. The paper complements our recent position paper on <i>Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights</i>, and DfID's target strategy papers on <i>Better Health for Poor People</i> and <i>Realising Human Rights for Poor People</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/3">There is an urgent need to make faster progress towards the fifth Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health. Every year worldwide, more than 529,000 women die from complications in pregnancy and childbirth, all but 2,500 of them in developing countries. The UK is firmly committed to the target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (the number of deaths per 100,000 live births) by three-quarters by 2015, from a 1990 baseline. The health of the mother is inextricably linked to the health of her newborn child.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/4">The paper sets out four priorities for DfID: increasing awareness and commitment to action, supporting partner countries to improve access to services, addressing wider barriers to maternal health, especially improving the status and rights of women, and generating and using new knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/5">DfID is already supporting work in all these areas but will increase those efforts and encourage partners to do likewise. The strategy includes a commitment to increase year-on-year investment in maternal health.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/6">I am placing a copy of the paper in the Library of the House. It is also available on DfID's website at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.5/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1083" name="Denis MacShane">My honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Mr Denis MacShane)</phrase> answered PQs 180074 and 180090 on <phrase class="date" code="">28 June</phrase> <i>(Official Report,</i> Commons, cols. 129 W and 131 W respectively<i>). </i>Both PQs related to the Middle East peace process. The Questions and Answers given were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/2" class="indent">PQ 180074:</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/3" class="indent">To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what estimate his department has made of the number of Israeli civilians killed since the beginning of the intifada in September 2000; and how many were under the age of 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/4" class="indent">Mr. MacShane: We estimate that 944 Israeli civilians have<i> </i>been killed since the beginning of the intifada in September 2000. This estimate is based on a variety of sources, including the UN, NGOs and the media. We do not hold figures for those killed under the age of 18 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/5" class="indent">PQ 180090:</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/6" class="indent">To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what estimate his department has made of the number of Palestinian civilians killed since September 2000; and how many were under 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/7" class="indent">Mr. MacShane: We estimate that 3,242 Palestinian civilians have been killed since the beginning of the intifada in September 2000. This estimate is based on a variety of sources, including the UN, NGOs and the media. We do not hold figures for those killed under the age of 18 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/8">Since answering PQs 180074 and 180090 however, it has been brought to our attention by the British Embassy in Tel Aviv that the figures provided in these answers on <phrase class="date" code="">28 June</phrase> were inaccurate. The figures given were for total deaths on each side rather than civilian deaths, so these figures would also include Israeli Defence Force soldiers, militants and suicide bombers as well as civilians.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.5/9">I apologise for this error and would like to clarify that the figures initially given in the Answer of <phrase class="date" code="">28 June</phrase> were for the total numbers of Israeli and Palestinian deaths rather than just civilian deaths. Figures for civilian deaths are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">11 June</phrase> the Council of the European Union adopted Common Position 2004/510/CFSP. The Council adopted EC Regulation 1353/2004 on <phrase class="date" code="">27 July</phrase>. These amend Common Position 2004/3l/CFSP of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January</phrase> and EC Regulation 131/2004 of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-28">28 January</phrase>, which renewed the arms embargo against Sudan and added an exemption for the supply of de-mining equipment. The new measures broaden the exemptions to the prohibition on the supply of arms, technical assistance and financial assistance to include crisis management operations of the African Union. This allows EU member states to offer full practical and financial support to the deployment of the African Union's Ceasefire Commission to Darfur. With the support of her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="">30 July</phrase> unanimously adopted Resolution 1556 (2004), which, inter alia imposes an arms embargo against non-governmental entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed, operating in the states of North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur in Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/2">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-27">27 July 2004</phrase> unanimously adopted Resolution 1552 (2004) on the situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This renewed the arms embargo imposed by UNSCR 1493 (2003) for one year and extended the mandate of the UN Expert Group established by UNSCR 1533 (2004) to monitor the embargo for a further six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/3">With the support of Her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="">8 June</phrase> unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004). Among other measures, the resolution leaves the arms embargo in place, with new exemptions for arms and related materiel required by the Government of Iraq or the multinational force to serve the purposes of the resolution. The resolution passes all outstanding rights, responsibilities and obligations relating to the Oil for Food Programme to the Government of Iraq, including ensuring independently authenticated confirmation that goods have been delivered, and it leaves in place the financial sanctions upon former Government of Iraq funds and any funds belonging to Saddam Hussein, senior members of his regime and their immediate family members.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/4">On <phrase class="date" code="">26 April</phrase>, the Council of the European Union adopted Common Position 2004/423/CFSP and EC Regulation 798/2004, concerning Burma. These renewed the restrictive measures imposed by Common Position 2003/297/CFSP from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase> for a further 12 months, in view of the current political situation in Burma, notably the failure of the regime to pursue the process of national reconciliation, respect for human rights and democracy. The restrictive measures comprise an assets freeze and travel ban against members of the regime and others, an arms embargo, a prohibition on the attachment and hosting of military personnel to diplomatic missions, restrictions on development programmes and a suspension of high-level bilateral governmental visits to Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/1">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) will today lay before Parliament the latest White Paper on Prospects for the EU (Cm 6310). Copies will be placed in the Library of the House and will be available from the Vote Office in the House of Commons and the Printed Paper Office in the House of Lords. A copy will also be available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/2">This White Paper is a supplement to the one published in April on <i>Prospects for the EU in 2004</i> (Cm 6174). As well as setting out the issues we expect the Union to address in the rest of the year, it updates readers on developments since April and provides a short breakdown of the achievements of Ireland's EU Presidency, which ran from January to June. It covers the full gamut of EU business, from enlargement&mdash;and whether we should start negotiations with Turkey on membership of the Union&mdash;to the Lisbon Agenda for economic and social reform&mdash;which includes developing the single market, simplifying new and outdated regulation, and increasing employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/3">The purpose of this White Paper, and April's, is to keep Parliament and the public informed about developments in the EU, the Government's approach to them and the benefits they will bring to the UK and its citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/4">The next White Paper on prospects for the EU will be published in January 2005, to be followed by a shorter update&mdash;along the lines of the one published today&mdash;in July 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/5">These White Papers are part of the Government's commitment to make EU business more accessible and interesting for Parliament, the media and members of the public alike by providing an appropriate amount of detail and depth on significant progress that might have an impact on our daily lives. I hope they will play a vital role in involving Parliament more closely in EU affairs, and trust that Members of both Houses will read them. I commend this White Paper to the House.</p>

	Director and Auditor Liability
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-09-07a.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="73"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040907/text/40907-51.htm#40907-52_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.73.1/1">The House will be aware that, between December 2003 and March 2004, the Government consulted widely on the case for reform of the law on director and auditor liability. Over 120 responses to the consultation were received from investors; companies, both large and small; auditors; legal advisers; industry bodies; academia; and the general public. I am grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">In the light of the consultation responses the Office of Fair Trading was asked to undertake a study of the potential impact on competition in the audit market of a cap on auditor liability. I am grateful to it for completing and publishing this so quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3" class="italic">Directors</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">It is essential for British competitiveness that we have a diverse pool of high-quality individuals willing to become directors, and that directors are willing to take informed and rational risks. But it is also important that directors act in accordance with their duties, and that negligent directors can be held to account by their companies. The courts have in recent years imposed a much more demanding standard of care, skill and diligence on directors. This has been a very welcome development.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">The consultation built on the recommendations both of the Company Law Review and of Sir Derek Higgs's study on non-executive directors. It identified two particular concerns:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/6" class="indent">exposure to liabilities arising from legal action against directors by third parties. The sharp rise in the number of class actions by groups of shareholders in the US has made this a particular concern for directors of British companies with a US listing;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/7" class="indent">the cost of lengthy court proceedings. Companies are currently permitted to indemnify a director against the cost of defending legal proceedings, but only when judgment has been given in the director's favour or he has been acquitted. For many directors, such indemnification comes too late and the prospect provides cold comfort.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/8">The consultation indicated these issues are affecting the recruitment and behaviour of directors. I therefore intend to introduce a balanced and proportionate package of reforms, by tabling amendments to the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Bill at its Commons Committee stage. The proposals will in particular introduce two important relaxations of the current prohibition on companies exempting their directors from, or indemnifying them against, liability:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/9" class="indent">they will permit, but not require, companies to indemnify directors in respect of proceedings brought by third parties (covering both legal costs and the financial costs of any adverse judgment, except for the legal costs of unsuccessful defence of criminal proceedings, fines imposed in criminal proceedings and penalties imposed by regulatory bodies such as the Financial Services Authority);</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/10" class="indent">they will permit, but not require, companies to pay directors' defence costs as they are incurred, even if the action is brought by the company itself. The director would still be liable to pay any damages awarded to the company and to repay his defence costs to the company if his defence were unsuccessful (except where the company chooses to indemnify the director in respect of his legal costs in civil proceedings brought by third parties).</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/11">The government amendments will also remove an arguable loophole under which a company in the same group may currently provide an indemnity to a director that would be unlawful if it was provided directly by the company of which the individual was a director.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/12">The amendments will also require disclosure in the directors' report by companies that indemnify directors. Shareholders will also have the right to inspect any indemnification agreement. Companies that do not indemnify directors will not have to make any disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/13" class="italic">Auditors</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/14">The consultation also covered the position of auditors.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/15">The Government wish to see a competitive and high-quality market for audit services, shareholders using high quality and reliable information, and an adequate system of redress for when things go wrong. There must also be an appropriate degree of transparency and accountability for the audit process.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/16">The Government are actively pursuing this agenda. The Bill already extends the powers of auditors to obtain information, and contains new provisions for each director to confirm that there is no relevant audit information of which he is aware but the company's auditors are unaware.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/17">There are also a number of initiatives to improve the quality of the audit and other information provided to shareholders. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/18" class="indent">the recommendations of the review chaired by Sir Robert Smith mean that in listed companies there will shortly be enhanced audit committee reporting to shareholders, including better information on key audit judgements;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/19" class="indent">the Auditing Practices Board, a subsidiary of the Financial Reporting Council, has published for comment draft new ethical standards relating to the independence of auditors which are expected to be finalised this autumn;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/20" class="indent">the Financial Reporting Council has established an Audit Inspection Unit which has begun independent reviews of the effectiveness of the audit procedures of the four largest audit firms;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/21" class="indent">the audit regulatory activities of the professional accountancy bodies are now subject to independent oversight by the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy, a subsidiary of the Financial Reporting Council;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/22" class="indent">a new Accountancy Investigation and Discipline Board has been established, as a subsidiary of the Financial Reporting Council, in order to investigate public interest cases of alleged breaches of professional standards by auditors and it has commenced its first investigation;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/23" class="indent">the Financial Reporting Council has recently set up a group under Douglas Flint to review the current guidance on internal risk control;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/24" class="indent">we are also considering carefully the responses to our recent consultation on the Operating and Financial Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/25">In line with the Company Law Review's recommendations, and as supported in the consultation, I have decided not to bring forward amendments to the current Bill to extend an auditor's duty of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/26">The consultation showed a wide variety of views both as to whether reform of the law on liability of auditors was needed, and if so what form it should take. Some investors also had concerns about whether the audit process was serving them sufficiently well. It was also a matter of concern that the leaders of some of our largest companies were worried their choice of auditor was limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/27">I have considered carefully whether there is a case for a change in the law on auditor liability. I am grateful to the Office of Fair Trading for looking at the competition implications of enabling shareholders to agree in advance a maximum amount for which the auditor would be liable. In the light of the consultation responses, and the OFT's advice that introducing a cap would not significantly enhance competition, I have concluded against proposing changes to the law on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/28">The Government remain committed to improving the operation of the audit market and will continue to consider any proposals, including the possibility of limiting liability on a proportionate basis by contract, which can be demonstrated significantly to enhance competition, and to improve quality, in the audit market. The Government intends to look closely at this option and actively calls upon auditors, business, and investors to work together to examine whether proposals for a system of proportionate liability via contract are practical and/or desirable.</p>
