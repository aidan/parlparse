	Prisoners: Voting Rights
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-02-02a.23.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="23"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60202-47.htm#60202-48_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.23.1/1">The recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Hirst, concerning prisoners' voting rights, has raised a number of difficult and complex issues which need careful consideration. The ECHR indicated that there should be proper debate about those issues. I have therefore concluded that the best way forward would be to embark on full public consultation in which all the options can be examined and which will give everyone the opportunity to have their say. A consultation document is therefore in preparation and I hope it will be available for discussion in a few weeks' time. Thereafter there will be a period for those with an interest to make their views known, which will help to inform the development of future policy.</p>
