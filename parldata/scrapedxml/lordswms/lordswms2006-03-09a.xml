	Mental Capacity Act 2005: Code of Practice
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-03-09a.67.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="67"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60309-46.htm#60309-48_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.67.3/1">I have today published a consultation paper on the code of practice for the Mental Capacity Act. The Act provides a statutory framework to empower people to make decisions for themselves as far as possible and protect vulnerable people who are not able to make their own decisions. A key element for the successful implementation of the Act is the code of practice, which provides guidance illustrating how the provisions of the Act should be applied in practical situations. My department is seeking views on the style and content of the draft code before final publication.</p>

	Poverty: Households below Average Income
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-03-09a.75.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="75"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60309-46.htm#60309-48_spmin5">
	<p pid="a.75.1/1">My honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (John Hutton) has published the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/2">Today I have published the households below average income (HBAI) report for 1994-95 to 2004-05. This is a report published under national statistics arrangements with results that cover Great Britain. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/3">The report shows the position during the financial year 2004-05. It reports on the levels of low-income among all client groups and the progression being made towards reducing poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/4">I am also publishing today our <i>Poverty Progress Report</i> which demonstrates the huge progress we have made in raising aspirations and breaking the cycle of deprivation in Britain. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/5">With income measured in absolute terms&mdash;that is, compared with 60 per cent of 1996-97 median income&mdash;between 1996-97 and 2004-05 over 7 million people have been lifted out of poverty; the number of children living in poverty has fallen by half; the number of working-age adults living in poverty has fallen by over a third; and, over 2 million fewer pensioners are living in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/6">With income measured in relative terms&mdash;that is, compared with 60 per cent of contemporary median income&mdash;between 1996-97 and 2004-05 there were over 2 million lifted out of poverty, of which, 800,000 were children, 600,000 were working-age adults and 1 million were pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/7">We have made significant progress on our journey to eradicating child poverty by 2020, the historic target we set in 1999. However, these figures also show how much more there is to do. We must now redouble our efforts in the years ahead; to focus relentlessly on the remaining barriers that hold people back in a new drive against social exclusion that will enable everyone to share in the nation's growing prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/8">Seven years on from setting the target of eradicating child poverty within a generation, we remain absolutely committed to our goal. By continuing to target support for those who need it most; by ensuring work for those who can; breaking the cycle of deprivation and working to deliver high-quality public services we are building a long-term approach to deliver long-term change, not just to tackle child poverty but to offer every individual and every generation the opportunity and support to raise, and fulfil, their aspirations.</p>
