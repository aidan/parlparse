	EU: General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-07-28a.155.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100308" speakername="Lord Howell of Guildford" colon=":" colnum="155"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100728-wms0001.htm#10072822000003">
	<p pid="a.155.1/1">The General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council were held on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-26">26 July</phrase> in Brussels. The UK was represented by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (William Hague) and my honourable friend the Minister for Europe (David Lidington).</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/2">The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/3"><I>General Affairs Council (GAC)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/4">The full text of all conclusions adopted, including &quot;A&quot; points, can be found at: <a href="http://www.consilium">http://www.consilium</a>. europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/genaff/115975.pdf.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/5"><I>Belgian presidency programme</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/6">Belgium outlined its priorities for the next six months, in five categories: the economic/financial crisis, combating poverty and social exclusion, international negotiations on climate, justice and home affairs, and the global influence of the EU. It also undertook to step up contact with the European Parliament. There was broad support for this outline, and for more substantial use of the GAC by the presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/7"><I>Enlargement: Iceland</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/8">Ministers agreed the EU's general position on the negotiating framework for Iceland's accession negotiations. This reflects the UK objectives on Icesave: the framework stipulates that Iceland must implement its EEA obligations, including those identified by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (i.e. Iceland's breach of the deposit guarantee directive). Official opening of the negotiations took place on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-27">27 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/9"><I>June European Council: follow-up</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/10">The presidency announced that a full-day GAC on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-13">13 September</phrase> would, amongst other things, follow up the substance of June discussions on Europe 2020. I recalled the Government's position on Europe 2020, and the June European Council conclusions relating to the budget setting process and its potential impact on the European Semester.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/11"><I>September European Council: preparation</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/12">The presidency confirmed that the September European Council would focus on foreign policy issues, and that the GAC and Foreign Ministers' informal Gymnich meetings in early September would be opportunities to prepare the discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/13"><I>European External Action Service</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/14">Ministers adopted the decision establishing the European External Action Service (EEAS) and setting out its organisation and functioning, as provided for in the treaty of Lisbon. The decision sets out the nature and scope of the service, its functions, its central administration, and the management of its staffing, budget and programming.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/15">I stressed once again the need for the EEAS to bear down on costs, and stick to treaty rules on the external representation of the EU. The high representative said she was committed to finding efficiency savings of at least 10 per cent within the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/16"><I>AOB: Situation of the Roma</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/17">France and Italy raised the plight of the Roma in Europe. The Commission called on member states to make greater use of the various EU funding instruments, and suggested that the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council take this forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/18"><I>Foreign Affairs Council (FAC)</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/19">The full text of all conclusions adopted, including &quot;A&quot; points, can be found at: <a href="http://www.consilium.europa">http://www.consilium.europa</a>. eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/115976.pdf.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/20"><I>Sudan</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/21">Ministers adopted a set of conclusions covering the issues facing Sudan over the coming months as the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) reaches its conclusion. These include the peaceful implementation of the CPA, including the upcoming referenda processes in South Sudan and Abyei; reaching an agreement on post-referendum issues and working towards long-term regional stability; the work of the African Union high level implementation panel; capacity building and assistance to meet the challenges faced by south Sudan; efforts to address insecurity and reach a lasting peace settlement for Darfur; the work of the International Criminal Court; and continued development and humanitarian assistance across Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/22">The Foreign Secretary welcomed the role of the EU at this critical time for Sudan, and called for reinvigorated efforts to deliver lasting peace for the whole of Sudan, ensure the referenda take place on time and to address the ongoing insecurity in Darfur. He added that ensuring an early EU observation mission to monitor the referenda should be a priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/23"><I>Iran</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/24">Ministers agreed a council decision setting out a comprehensive package of EU sanctions against Iran, in response to the challenges posed by Iran's nuclear programme and in line with the dual track strategy of engagement and pressure. The Foreign Secretary welcomed the package, noting that it was a good example of how EU member states could work together on matters of global security. Foreign Ministers also agreed the importance of maintaining open lines of communication with Tehran.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/25"><I>Gaza/Middle East Peace Process</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/26">The high representative briefed on her recent visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Ministers were supportive of her visit and her analysis of the situation on the ground. Ministers agreed a press statement, to be made on the authority of the high representative, expressing EU concern with the lack of progress on the peace process, supporting the quartet's 24-month timeframe for negotiations to lead to a two-state solution, and urging both sides to refrain from any provocative actions (citing in particular settlement activity, including in East Jerusalem).</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/27"><I>Ukraine</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/28">Sweden and Poland raised concerns about media and political freedoms in Ukraine, and the slow pace of progress towards an EU-Ukraine free trade agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/29"><I>Kaliningrad</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/30">Poland asked for support to amend a local border traffic directive to cover the whole of the Kaliningrad region. This issue was remitted to Interior Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/31"><I>Cuba</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/32">Spain reported on its efforts to engage the Cuban authorities on political prisoners. No decisions were taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/33"><I>Bosnia and Herzegovina</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/34">Ministers discussed EU policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina over lunch and agreed on the importance of more effective EU engagement on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/35"><I>Serbia/Kosovo</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/36">Ministers discussed Kosovo in the light of last week's International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion. They confirmed their support for Baroness Ashton's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-22">22 July</phrase>, and for her offer, made on behalf of the EU, to facilitate a process of dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade. This dialogue would be to promote co-operation, achieve progress on the path to Europe, and improve the lives of the people of the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/37"><I>AOB</I></p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/38">Under AOB, Ministers briefly discussed Cyprus settlement talks, tensions between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean Sea, fYROM, and the forthcoming EU/Africa summit.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/39">The council adopted the list of &quot;A&quot; points, including on:</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/40">Kyrgyzstan;Iran;Sudan; and</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/41">European neighbourhood policy.</p>
