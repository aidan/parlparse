	<p pid="a.87.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.3/2">The MoD's responsibility for maintaining the UK's nuclear warhead capability is fulfilled through Atomic Weapons Establishment Management Limited (AWE ML) as the prime contractor. The Atomic Weapons Establishment, which was previously a directly employed business within the MoD, was contractorised in 1993 and affected MoD staff transferred to AWE plc under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employees) Regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.3/3">AWE plc operate a final salary pension scheme for its employees. This is a funded scheme administered under a trust and, as such, is exposed to the volatility of financial markets. The latest valuation in 2005 revealed a deficit of &pound;73 million against total liabilities of some &pound;589 million. Since then, AWE ML have been developing and consulting staff and trade unions on a range of proposed amendments which would address this deficit. AWE ML is determined to maintain the existing final salary scheme for both existing and new employees but this will require an increase in pension contributions. The alternative would be the closure of the scheme. The present annual value of the required additional contributions to the scheme is estimated to be some &pound;9 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.3/4">During the Committee stage of the Atomic Weapons Establishment Bill in 1991 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, <phrase class="date" code="1991-02-14">14 February 1991</phrase>, col. 223), the then Under-Secretary of State for Defence Procurement made an undertaking that any increase in employee contributions would be offset by a compensating adjustment to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.3/5">This undertaking was made in a very different context to the one in which occupational pension schemes now operate. Pension schemes both in the public and private sectors have undergone major changes in response to improving health and healthcare, longevity and returns on investments. Even if AWE employees had remained as civil servants, they would not have been unaffected by these dynamics; new pension arrangements were introduced for the Civil Service last year and final salary schemes are now closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.3/6">While AWE ML will continue to fund the bulk of the pension costs through its employer contributions, AWE employees will also need to increase their contributions in today's circumstances. AWE ML will implement any changes to the pension scheme only following proper consultation with the trades unions and scheme members.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Purnell) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/2">Today I am publishing the independent living strategy. This is a cross-government strategy that will give disabled people more choice and control over the services they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/3">The independent living review was launched in July 2006 to find imaginative and practical ways of supporting independent living for disabled people. The Office for Disability issues have led the development of the strategy bringing together the views and experience of disabled people, organisations of disabled people, service-delivery organisations and central and local government officials. The strategy has been developed with and is jointly owned by the Department of Health, the Department for Transport, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/4">The strategy marks a unique and radical approach to government working. It has been developed in partnership with disabled people to ensure that it reflects their real life experiences of the barriers to independent living and has drawn on their expertise to identify how to address these barriers. An expert panel, chaired by Baroness Campbell, has advised on the strategy's development and disabled people&mdash;including younger disabled people who are reaching adulthood and older disabled people&mdash;have been involved in meetings and workshops during the development of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/5">The strategy draws together recent Government commitments to remove barriers to independent living and to improve access to services, including better support for older people in their current homes, improved support for disabled young people and their families, and additional investment to transform support to older and disabled people. The strategy also makes a series of new commitments including:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/6">demonstrating how to move resources from professional assessment and care management to user-led support, advocacy and brokerage to ensure people get the right support to make decisions for themselves; a regional initiative to promote independent living for older disabled people with high support needs;a national strategy to enable people to remain in employment when they acquire an impairment or their condition worsens;an awareness campaign aimed at practitioners (in social work, the National Health Service and elsewhere) and disabled people themselves to ensure that health, social care and other services are delivered in ways which enable disabled people to have choice and control over how their needs are met;a new toolkit to assist the development of local independent living strategies for and with older disabled people; and good practice guidance to enable people to have choice and control over their continuing healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/7">The strategy is designed to make a real and measurable impact on the lives of disabled people and contains a commitment to monitor the impact of the strategy, year on year, in partnership with disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/8">The Government are committed to equality for all disabled people by 2025. Today's independent living strategy is a major step towards achieving this aim.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.1/1">My right honourable friend theChancellor of the Exchequer (Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/2">The Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-12">12 February 2008</phrase>. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury attended for the UK. The items on the agenda were as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.89.1/4">Ministers adopted council opinions on the stability programmes of Germany, Italy, Finland, Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands and on the convergence programmes of the UK, Hungary, Sweden, Romania and Slovakia. The UK supports a prudent interpretation of the stability and growth pact (SGP) which takes into account the economic cycle, sustainability and the important role of public investment.</p>

The UK strongly supports these conclusions and believes that it is crucial for finance Ministers to engage with this important agenda. Work on the economic dimension of energy and climate change and on the international financing aspects of global action will now continue at working group level with a view to providing an update to ECOFIN in the autumn of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/7"><I>Better </I><I>R</I><I>egulation</I></p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/8">Ministers exchanged views on better regulation in view of the recent publication of the European Commission's second &quot;strategic review&quot;. Ministers agreed that this was an important agenda that all council formations should engage with. The UK supports the positive efforts of the Commission and welcomes the progress made both at member states and EU level towards reducing administrative burdens in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/9"><I>General B</I><I>udget of the European Union</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Discharge </I><I>p</I><I>rocedure </I><I>i</I><I>n </I><I>r</I><I>espect </I><I>of the i</I><I>mplem</I><I>entation of the Budget for 2006</I></p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/10">Ministers adopted a recommendation for discharge of the 2006 EU Budget, on which the European Court of Auditors presented its report to ECOFIN in November 2007. The UK particularly supported the emphasis put on the need for all actors involved in the implementation of EU expenditure to continue to improve the functioning of supervisory and control systemsin order to make further progress towards achieving a positive statement of assurance in all areas of the EC budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/2">I am today announcing plans for my department to take forward work to consider the long-term capacity of the M11 motorway and the West Anglia Main Line. This is in recognition of the proposed growth in the draft east of England plan and the need to support this with effective and sustainable transport links. This work would also need to take account of potential expansion of Stansted airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/3">Last year my predecessor announced publication of the Highways Agency's consultation on plans to widen the M11 between junctions 6 and junction 8, and to improve the junction access from the M11 and the A120 to Stansted airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/4">I consider that the form of capacity improvements to the M11 in the period before 2030 requires further assessment and as a result I have asked the Highways Agency to carry out further work to look into this. This work will take account of the forecast growth in the region and ensure that, in seeking to exploit the region's economic opportunities, we do so in a socially and environmentally sustainable way, considering a range of ways to provide the additional capacity that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/5">If this work determines that widening the M11 is needed, it has been agreed that BAA would contribute to the overall costs, subject to the necessary referral to the economic regulator. My department will announce shortly the results of the consultation on the schemes required to provide access from the M11 and A120 to an expanded Stansted airport, which BAA has agreed to fund in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/6">I also recognise that growth in the region and the associated number of new houses will place additional pressures on the West Anglia Main Line between Liverpool Street station and Cambridge.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/7">Therefore, to complement the Highways Agency's further work on the M11, I am also asking Network Rail to develop and bring forward proposals for enhancing the West Anglia Main Line. This work should examine the case for further enhancements, to provide for longer-term capacity and service improvements, in the context of Network Rail's recent Greater Anglia route utilisation strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/8">Following recent feasibility work led by my department, I confirm that this assessment should incorporate consideration of line and route improvements including a potential four-tracking option from Tottenham Hale to south of Cheshunt, and an assessment of what commitments would be needed to deliver this solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/9">The anticipated timescales for this assessment are for necessary development work and powers to be completed within railway control period 4 (2009-14), with a view to targeting delivery in control period 5 (2014-19).</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/10">This would be in addition to the more immediate capacity enhancements I announced in my White Paper <I>Delivering a Sustainable Railway</I>, and high-level output specification, which were published last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/11">As with the M11, this work will draw on forecast demand from wider regional growth, as well as from the potential increase in the number of passengers resulting from any expansion of Stansted airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/12">Both the work on the M11 and the West Anglia Main Line will be led by my department, engaging industry, developers and other key stakeholders as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.3/13">I aim to report progress on both of these projects later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.1/2">I am pleased to announce that light dues rates and the tonnage threshold will remain the same for 2008-09. As a result of continuing efficiency gains made by the general lighthouse authorities we were able to cut dues by 10 per cent in 2006, which we held down at that level in 2007 and now will hold again in 2008. We shall continue to work closely with the general lighthouse authorities to streamline and improve services further to reduce costs where we can, while maintaining prudent funding to meet their liabilities and high standards of safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/3">I also welcome the publication of the Irish lights evidence study today. The study sets out evidence on the funding of the provision of aids to navigation in the Republic of Ireland. It will provide the basis for negotiations between the UK and Irish Governments to find a long-term funding solution for the Commissioners of Irish Lights. I am placing copies of the study in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
