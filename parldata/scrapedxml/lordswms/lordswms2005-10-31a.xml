<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-10-31a.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51031-27.htm#51031-28_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.1.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase>, President Mahmud Ahmadinejad of Iran addressed a conference in Tehran on &quot;A World Without Zionism&quot;. In his speech, he is reported to have called for &quot;Israel to be wiped from the map&quot;, and said that &quot;the Islamic world will not let its historic enemy live in its heartland&quot;, &quot;the new wave of (attacks) in Palestine will erase this stigma from the Islamic world&quot; and that &quot;anybody who recognises Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in his press conference at the European Council at Hampton Court on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>, these sentiments are completely unacceptable. I welcome the clear condemnation by the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="">28 October</phrase> and the statement by the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, expressing his dismay. They have spoken for the world. Israel is a long-standing member of the United Nations with the same rights and obligations as every other. Under the United Nations charter, Iran, like other members of the organisation, has undertaken to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">Mr Annan has also said he intends to place at the top of his agenda when he visits Iran in the next few weeks the Middle East peace process and the right of all states in the area to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries free from threats or acts of force. I welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/4">At the informal summit of European Union Heads of Government at Hampton Court on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>, the Presidency issued the following statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/5">&quot;EU leaders meeting at Hampton Court today condemned in the strongest terms the comments in respect of the state of Israel attributed to President Ahmedinejad of Iran. Calls for violence, and for the destruction of any state, are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/6">Such comments will cause concern about Iran's role in the region, and its future intentions. The fact that these comments were made on the same day as a horrific attack on Israeli civilians should reinforce the lesson that incitement to violence, and the terrorism that it breeds, are despicable and unacceptable acts. For its part, the EU remains committed to a solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute based on the principle of two states living side-by-side in peace and security. It urges all parties in the region to do their utmost to bring that vision to fulfilment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/7">In addition, on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>, the Foreign Office summoned the Iranian charg&eacute; d'affaires in London on behalf of the European Union to protest at the remarks. Many of our European partners and other countries have done likewise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/8">We welcome too the international community's forthright condemnation, and their reaffirmation of the right of Israel to exist. We welcome particularly the statements by officials of the Palestinian Authority and other governments in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/9">We remain profoundly concerned at Iran's links to groups trying to undermine peace in the Middle East through violence, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad which claimed responsibility for the horrific attack at Hadera in Israel on <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase>. The EU has said that Iran's policies towards the Middle East peace process and terrorism are among the factors it will consider when formulating its policy towards Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/10">President Ahmadinejad's remarks also underline the imperative for Iran to take steps to address international concerns about the intentions of its nuclear programme, and to provide objective guarantees that that programme is for solely peaceful purposes. We call on Iran to meet urgently and in full the requests of the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors, to suspend fully all of its uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and return to talks with the E3/EU on the basis of the Paris agreement.</p>
