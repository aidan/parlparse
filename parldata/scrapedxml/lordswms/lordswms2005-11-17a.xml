	<p pid="a.91.1/1">Subject to parliamentary approval of any necessary supplementary estimate, the Cabinet Office DEL will be increased by &pound;1,735,000 from &pound;224,409,000 to &pound;226,144,000. There is no movement in the administration costs limits. Within the DEL change, the impact on resources and capital are as set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.1/13">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from drawdown of EYF of &pound;550,000 and a transfer of &pound;1,185,000 from various government departments to fund protective security measures relating to state and government assets in central London.</p>
