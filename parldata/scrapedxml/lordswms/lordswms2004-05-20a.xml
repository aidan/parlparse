	Firearms: Consultative Arrangements

	<p pid="a.37.1/1">Following the Home Secretary's decision not to further extend the life of the Firearms Consultative Committee, we have been considering how best to establish a forum for consultation and to assist in the current review of legislation. We have decided to establish a broad-based firearms advisory committee with around 21 members to be drawn in equal measure from shooting interests; law enforcement/regulation; and organisations and community groups with an interest in the social consequences of firearms use and misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">The committee's terms of reference will be to advise the Home Secretary on the law and policy on firearms, having regard to the need to maintain public safety and prevent criminal misuse and taking into account the interests of legitimate shooters and the efficient, effective administration of controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">It will be assisted in this task by a technical sub-committee with 12 to 15 members drawn principally from representatives of law enforcement bodies and shooting organisations with knowledge and experience of firearms matters. The sub-committee's terms of reference will be to consider the technical and legal aspects of administering and enforcing firearms controls and to make recommendations to the firearms advisory committee on these and such other matters as may be referred to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/4">We will be approaching interested organisations and individuals to seek nominations to serve on one or both committees with a view to appointing members as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/5">The committee will be asked to submit a report of its work after 12 months and copies will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.3/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that regulations are necessary, give effective protection, balance cost and risk, are fair and command public confidence. In accordance with this, we require departments to produce and publish regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) for all regulatory proposals likely to have an impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/2">My honourable friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office has today presented to Parliament a Command Paper listing RIAs published between <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">31 December 2003</phrase>. Copies of those RIAs listed are available in the Library. This is the 20th such Command Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.1/97">1 Departments and Agencies which received 10 MPs/Peers letters or less during 2003 are not shown in this table. Holding or interim replies are not included unless otherwise indicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/98">2 DCA is currently undertaking changes to its processes for handling correspondence. In the short term these have lead to delays in response time, but in the longer term will improve the quality of responses. These changes include quality control of all responses, and revising the DCA correspondence monitoring system.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.1/100">4 Includes all Ministerial correspondence.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/101">5 The statistics for the FSA are dominated by a single lobbying campaign which accounted for almost 70% of its total annual correspondence. The Agency is reviewing its procedures for handling peaks of work arising from such a campaign. Majority of replies are signed by Health Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/102">6 2003 figures also include a small number of letters from members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/103">7 Department of Health improved its performance to just under 70% in the last quarter of 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/104">8 Figures include a small number of interim replies relating to correspondence sent to HM Prison Service. 2003 performance figures also include 16,268 cases answered directly by the Director General of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. Response times to these cases relate to drafting performance only. Figures based on final replies will be available for 2004. Immigration and Nationality Directorate response target was increased to 20 working days with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> to account for the wide geographical spread of offices and the nature of the correspondence which is predominantly about specific cases rather than policy issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/105">9 The CRB target was raised from 5 to 10 working days at the beginning of 2003 to reflect the standard set out in the CRB's Corporate Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/106">10 Performance suffered due to the exceptionally high volume of correspondence following the introduction of the Working and Child Tax Credits in April 2003 and because, early in 2003&ndash;04, the Revenue's priority was to get claimants into payment. Since the processing of tax credits claims has been stable, the Revenue has restored normal complaints-handling procedures and increased the resources on its complaints teams.
