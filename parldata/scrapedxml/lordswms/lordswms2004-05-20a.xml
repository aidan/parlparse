	Firearms: Consultative Arrangements
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-05-20a.37.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="37"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040520/text/40520-35.htm#40520-35_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.37.1/1">Following the Home Secretary's decision not to further extend the life of the Firearms Consultative Committee, we have been considering how best to establish a forum for consultation and to assist in the current review of legislation. We have decided to establish a broad-based firearms advisory committee with around 21 members to be drawn in equal measure from shooting interests; law enforcement/regulation; and organisations and community groups with an interest in the social consequences of firearms use and misuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">The committee's terms of reference will be to advise the Home Secretary on the law and policy on firearms, having regard to the need to maintain public safety and prevent criminal misuse and taking into account the interests of legitimate shooters and the efficient, effective administration of controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">It will be assisted in this task by a technical sub-committee with 12 to 15 members drawn principally from representatives of law enforcement bodies and shooting organisations with knowledge and experience of firearms matters. The sub-committee's terms of reference will be to consider the technical and legal aspects of administering and enforcing firearms controls and to make recommendations to the firearms advisory committee on these and such other matters as may be referred to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/4">We will be approaching interested organisations and individuals to seek nominations to serve on one or both committees with a view to appointing members as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/5">The committee will be asked to submit a report of its work after 12 months and copies will be placed in the Library.</p>

	Department of Health: Reducing Bureaucracy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-05-20a.37.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="37"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040520/text/40520-36.htm#40520-36_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.37.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-30">30 October</phrase>, I announced to the Health Committee that the department would be conducting a review of its arm's length bodies (ALBs). The first stage of this has now been completed. I wanted to update the House on the decisions that I have taken and how the review will move forward to the next stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/3">In his Budget speech, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer remarked on the importance that the Government attach to improving public sector efficiency and reducing bureaucracy. In the Budget report, he set out that &quot;the pursuit of efficiency also includes reducing bureaucracy, which both cuts headquarters' administration costs and frees up time of front-line professionals to respond better to the needs of their customers&quot;. The department's ALB review needs to be seen in this context and related to the work of Sir Peter Gershon in reviewing public sector efficiency. It is about putting the front line first, and it is clear from the first stage of the ALB review that, although much good work continues to be done by ALBs, there is considerable scope for improving efficiency and reducing bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/4">The review covers bodies undertaking national functions sponsored by the department that were in existence or in the pipeline in 2003&ndash;04. The 42 ALBs included in the review are listed below. In a full year, ALBs spend more than &pound;2.5 billion and employ more than 22,000 staff. If left unchanged, they would employ about 10 times the number of staff of the department itself after completion of its change programme. It is clear from the analysis we have done during the first stage of the review that:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/5">there are overlapping and duplicated functions;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/6">there is scope for reducing unnecessary regulatory and policy activities;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/7">back-office functions such as human resources, finance, information technology and estates could be carried out more effectively;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/8">a considerable number of bodies could be merged, thereby reducing overheads and integrating like functions;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/9">some bodies could be moved to a more independent status with greater stakeholder control; and</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/10">there is scope for significant efficiency and productivity gains particularly in the area of services acquired centrally for the National Health Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/11">The ALB sector has grown over several decades and, as currently constituted, does not best meet the health and social care needs of today and tomorrow. I have therefore asked my department to take forward with the sector a reform agenda that delivers the following objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/12">maximum devolution of responsibility to front-line NHS and social care;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/13">improved efficiency across the sector with minimal bureaucratic overhead;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/14">closer working across the boundaries between health and social care; and</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/15">minimised burden of inspection and regulation on health and social care services without reduced effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/16">These objectives are aimed at putting the front line first and improving services for the public while ensuring value for public money.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/17">In light of preliminary findings of the first stage, I have set the parameters for the next stage of this review. These are, against a baseline year of 2003&ndash;04:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/18">a 50 per cent reduction in the number of ALBs;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/19">a saving in expenditure by ALBs of &pound;0.5 billion by 2007&ndash;08; and</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/20">a reduction in posts of 25 per cent in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/21">Changes on this scale will enable considerable extra resources to be redeployed to the front line. For example, another &pound;0.5 billion would provide for four new hospitals, or 20,000 more nurses, or 6,250 consultants, or 7,500 general practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/22">I recognise that the changes in prospect will cause uncertainty and disruption, but they are needed. I intend for the next stage of the review to be completed as quickly as possible, within my parameters, and taking into account the need for proper discussion with the ALBs concerned and the devolved administrations. The department will be in touch with ALB chairs and chief executives shortly to discuss our ideas for change. We want to work with them on the detail of our proposals over the next two months. We are hoping to complete this next stage by the end of June so that decisions can be announced before the summer recess.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.1/97">1 Departments and Agencies which received 10 MPs/Peers letters or less during 2003 are not shown in this table. Holding or interim replies are not included unless otherwise indicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/98">2 DCA is currently undertaking changes to its processes for handling correspondence. In the short term these have lead to delays in response time, but in the longer term will improve the quality of responses. These changes include quality control of all responses, and revising the DCA correspondence monitoring system.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/99">3 Formerly the Public Record Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/100">4 Includes all Ministerial correspondence.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/101">5 The statistics for the FSA are dominated by a single lobbying campaign which accounted for almost 70% of its total annual correspondence. The Agency is reviewing its procedures for handling peaks of work arising from such a campaign. Majority of replies are signed by Health Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/102">6 2003 figures also include a small number of letters from members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/103">7 Department of Health improved its performance to just under 70% in the last quarter of 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/104">8 Figures include a small number of interim replies relating to correspondence sent to HM Prison Service. 2003 performance figures also include 16,268 cases answered directly by the Director General of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. Response times to these cases relate to drafting performance only. Figures based on final replies will be available for 2004. Immigration and Nationality Directorate response target was increased to 20 working days with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> to account for the wide geographical spread of offices and the nature of the correspondence which is predominantly about specific cases rather than policy issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/105">9 The CRB target was raised from 5 to 10 working days at the beginning of 2003 to reflect the standard set out in the CRB's Corporate Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/106">10 Performance suffered due to the exceptionally high volume of correspondence following the introduction of the Working and Child Tax Credits in April 2003 and because, early in 2003&ndash;04, the Revenue's priority was to get claimants into payment. Since the processing of tax credits claims has been stable, the Revenue has restored normal complaints-handling procedures and increased the resources on its complaints teams. As a result, performance should begin to improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/107">11 DTI increased its response target from 10 to 15 working days with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January</phrase> in line with other main Whitehall departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/108">12 2003 data currently not available because of transfer to OFCOM.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/109">13 The Child Benefit Centre transferred to the Inland Revenue with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>. Figures quoted are for the period 1/1/03 to 31/3/03.</p>
