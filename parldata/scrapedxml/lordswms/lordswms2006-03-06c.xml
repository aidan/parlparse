	Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-06c.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060306/text/60306-29.htm#60306-29_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.47.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.1/2">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 makes provision for the use of animals for education and training. In considering project licence applications for education and training, the Home Office defines education as the transfer of knowledge or the ability to formulate and test hypotheses, and training as the development or maintenance of manual skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.1/3">In practice, project licences for training purposes have been issued only for the training of practising surgeons in micro-vascular techniques, when applicants could demonstrate that no alternative methods could achieve the specific training objectives. However, the 1986 Act does not prohibit the authorisation of projects for training in other manual techniques and applications for other categories of training in manual skills can be considered. After very careful consideration, the Home Office has recently granted a licence under the 1986 Act to train a small number of personal licensees in a specialist injection technique to enable progress to be made towards developing and introducing a novel test method that will allow a particular therapeutic product to be evaluated using a mouse model rather than the currently used non-human primate model. I am satisfied that this animal use is justified as an exception to our general policy that licences will usually be granted only for training in micro-vascular techniques and that the requisite level of technical competence could not be obtained by other means.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.1/4">The exception made is specific to this application and programme of animal use. It is not intended as a broader change in policy on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.47.3/1">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw) and Sir John Grant (UK Permanent Representative to the EU) represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-27">27 February 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/2">The agenda items were covered as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/3" class="italic">Preparation of the European Council, 23-<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/4">The presidency presented an annotated draft agenda for the 23-<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase> European Council meeting to be held in Brussels. The focus of the European Council will be its annual review of the strategy for growth and jobs set out at Lisbon in March 2000 and relaunched last year. The presidency hopes the European Council will identify a series of priority actions to be implemented by the end of 2007 to fulfil these commitments. These priority actions should form a good basis on which to implement the second cycle of the Lisbon strategy in spring 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/5">In a short discussion, Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy Commissioner Wallstrom welcomed the annotated draft agenda particularly the focus on economic and energy issues. Several member states intervened on the structure of the draft agenda and priority action points.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/6" class="italic">Financial Perspective: Inter-Institutional Agreement (IIA)</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/7">The presidency presented its paper on progress in negotiations with the European Parliament on a proposal for renewal of an agreement between the EU institutions on budgetary discipline and improvement of the EU's annual budgetary procedure. The presidency reported that the trilogue meeting between representatives of Parliament, Council and Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-21">21 February</phrase> had been constructive and that they aimed to reach an agreement on a new inter-institutional agreement by April.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/8">The presidency announced that the next trilogue meeting would take place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.47.3/11">Commissioner Rehn expressed his hope that negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement (SAA) with Serbia and Montenegro could be concluded by the end of this year but a precondition was full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). If Belgrade's co-operation with the ICTY does not improve, the Commission would be obliged to disrupt SAA negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/12">CFSP High Representative Solana briefed the council on the efforts of his personal representative, Ambassador Mirolsav Lajcak, to forge consensus between government and opposition parties in Montenegro on the modalities for the proposed referendum on the future of the state union with Serbia. The council reaffirmed its support for the efforts of Ambassador Lajcak.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/13">In a brief discussion of Kosovo, member states underlined the need for further progress on standards implementation including decentralisation, and for the future status settlement to incorporate strong assurances in respect of the rights and cultural heritage of minority communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/14">The council adopted conclusions covering Montenegro, Kosovo and ICTY co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/15" class="italic">Schengen Visa Fees</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/16">The council held a short discussion on the draft decision to increase administrative fees for Schengen visa applications. The proposed increase results from the introduction of biometric identifiers and the establishment of a visa information system. Several member states highlighted the need to take into account foreign and neighbourhood policy concerns when deciding on proposed increases to Schengen visa fees. The possibility of exemptions might also apply in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/17">The presidency took note of the concerns expressed. These will be taken into account in future negotiations with a view to the Justice and Home Affairs Council taking a decision on 27-<phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/18" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/19">The Foreign Secretary briefed the council on his recent visit to Iraq and explained that the rapid formation of a competent and effective government was important for national unity. He urged the council and member states to offer support to Iraq's politicians and to the democratic process during this critical period. The council adopted conclusions condemning the bombing of the holy shrine in Samarra and subsequent violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/20" class="italic">Reactions in the Muslim world to publications in the European media</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/21">The council discussed the cartoons that had appeared in European media recently and adopted conclusions which recognise that freedom of expression is a fundamental right of a democratic society and strongly condemned the violent acts that followed publication of the cartoons. The conclusions also encouraged the exercise of freedom of expression in a spirit of respect for religious and other beliefs and convictions and acknowledged the offence and distress felt by Muslims worldwide as a result of the cartoons. Ministers agreed to enhance dialogue with the Muslim world on these and other issues through various fora.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/22" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process</p>

	<p pid="c.47.3/24" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/25">German Foreign Minister Steinmeier briefed partners on the latest developments on the nuclear file. CFSP High Representative Solana and External Relations Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner also briefed the council on their recent meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki which included discussion of the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue. The presidency agreed that Ministers should discuss Iran again following the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase> International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors meeting.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.3/26">The council adopted conclusions which regretted Iran's decision to withhold co-operation with the IAEA; deplored Iran's resumption of enrichment-related activities; reaffirmed the EU's commitment to a diplomatic solution and called on Iran to reconsider its position on its nuclear issues activities and other areas of concern in order to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the EU.

	Ministry of Defence: Preferred Bidder Announcement
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-06c.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="51"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060306/text/60306-30.htm#60306-30_spmin1">
	<p pid="c.51.1/1">My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Don Touhig) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/2">The Defence Training Review (DTR) Rationalisation Programme aims to improve, modernise and rationalise the delivery of Phase 2 and Phase 3 specialist training. It is a PFI/PPP solution, over 25 years, designed to deliver training on a defence rather than single service basis, bringing about the necessary modernisation and flexibility required to accommodate the department's changing training requirements. The chosen solution will involve rationalising the existing training estate and providing significant investment in key sites to create nationally recognised centres of training excellence.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/3">Bidders' proposals were received for Package 1 on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-17">17 October 2005</phrase>, and Package 2 on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-14">14 November 2005</phrase>, and a period of evaluation is currently underway. The nomination of preferred bidders for the two DTR packages is dependent on the bidders' proposals containing sufficient detail to allow the commercial core of the deal to be clearly understood and a decision on the preferred solution to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/4">At the conclusion of the evaluation process for Package 1 there remains some significant areas that require clarification in the bidders' proposals. As a consequence the DTR team is resolving these outstanding issues. This will clearly affect the published programme and we now do not expect the announcement of the preferred bidders until later this year. This timetable will be subject to successful conclusion of evaluation of Package 2 and the MoD and Treasury's approval process.</p>

	<p pid="c.52.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (Jane Kennedy) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/2">Today I am pleased to announce the launch of the consultation on new proposals to update the topic selection process for National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's work programme. As NICE's role has changed in the past 12 months and the institute has taken on its new public health responsibilities, it is the right time to look at changes to the process of topic selection.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/3">Topic selection is a critical part of the process of producing guidance. Deciding what questions we want to ask NICE on the clinical and cost effectiveness of treatments is often a good deal harder than getting the answers and no less important. It is therefore vital that the mechanisms we have in place for the selection of topics produce the questions on issues of real priority to the NHS and in the public health arena.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/4">While the existing process has served well over the past four years, topic selection needs to keep with pace with changes in both the NHS and NICE. We need the process to be more responsive and have more NHS and public health representation to ensure the topics going to NICE are the ones where advice is most needed. At the same time, the selection of public health topics must also be fully integrated into the new process so any impact these topics might have on the institute's other work programmes can be identified.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/5">The consultation will begin on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March 2006</phrase> and ends on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June 2006</phrase>. Copies of the consultation documents will be available in the Library and on the Department of Health website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/Consultations/LiveConsultations/LiveConsultationsArticle/fs/en">www.dh.gov.uk/Consultations/LiveConsultations/LiveConsultationsArticle/fs/en</a>?CONTENT&ndash;ID=4131055&amp;chk=7xp%2Bnk.
