	<p pid="b.17.1/1">On the <phrase class="date" code="">25 May</phrase> my department published a policy paper on electoral administration which seeks views on a number of issues relating to the way elections are run. My right honourable friend the Minister of State Department for Constitutional Affairs, Harriet Harman has also written to all honourable Members enclosing a copy of the paper and inviting them to respond as part of the consultation process. Copies of the paper have also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.1/2">The paper seeks views on our proposals for changes to the administrative arrangements for elections, in particular on those which relate to postal voting and registration. We intend to implement these measures in time for the local elections due next May, so to meet the legislative timetable the time for responses is short. But we are keen to engage all stakeholders in the process so that effective and workable solutions are developed.</p>
