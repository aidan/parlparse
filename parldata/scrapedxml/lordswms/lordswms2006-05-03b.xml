	<p pid="b.33.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/2">I am today announcing my intention to engage a consultant to conduct a strategic review of the independent living funds, in the context of the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report <i>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People</i>. This is in line with our aim regularly to review the functions, organisation and management of all non-departmental public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/3">The independent living funds enable thousands of severely disabled people to live independently and we need to consider the future direction of the funds in the light of our goal of equality for disabled people and the wider context of proposed changes in social care outlined by the Department of Health White Paper <i>Our health, Our care, Our say</i>.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/4">The consultant will supply independent expert advice and carry out a public consultation in order to provide recommendations as to the future direction of the funds. The independent living funds will discharge &pound;263 million of public funds during 2006&ndash;07 so it is essential that we have an independent and informed review of their role.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/5">I am placing a copy of the terms of reference for the review in the Library. The consultant will be asked to report to Ministers by the end of December 2006.</p>
