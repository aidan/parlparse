	<p pid="b.61.3/1">My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/2">In my Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, I undertook to report to Parliament on a quarterly basis on the operation of the UK's asset-freezing regime. This is the second of these reports and covers the period January-March 2007.<sup>1</sup></p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/3"><I>Asset-freezing framework</I></p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/4">The Government launched their strategy to combat money laundering and terrorist finance on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-28">28 February 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/5">As my Statement to Parliament of the same date explained, the strategy outlines the Government's key priorities for the future, along with measures to deliver these. New measures include further steps to promote the proactive use of asset-freezing powers; notably, the creation of a dedicated Treasury asset-freezing unit that will increase the expertise and operational focus brought to bear on asset freezing, in response to advice from law enforcement and security agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/6"><I>Asset-freezing designations</I></p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/7">In the quarter January-March 2007, the Treasury made 19 domestic designations under the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006. Of these, 12 persons already designated under earlier orders were re-designated under these orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/8">The terrorism order and the Al-Qaeda and Taliban order provide, where appropriate, for designations to be made confidentially and with restricted circulation of notice. No persons were designated on this basis in this quarter.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/9">Two persons were designated on the basis of closed-source evidence provided by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. There were no financial sanctions listings, in relation to terrorism or Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, of persons with links to the UK at the EU or the UN. No designated persons have been delisted in this quarter.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/10">A total of 223 separate accounts and approximately &pound;555,000<sup>2</sup> of suspected terrorist funds have been frozen in the UK since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/11"><I>Litigation</I></p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/12" qnum="2006">EWCH 2328 (Admin), confirmed the High Court judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-22">22 September 2006</phrase> upholding the Treasury's actions regarding benefits payments to the households of listed individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/13"><I>Reviews</I></p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/14">The Treasury keeps domestic asset-freezing cases under review. A number of formal reviews have been initiated in this quarter and the reviews of 12 cases have been completed. In all cases decisions were taken following the review to maintain the asset freeze.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/15"><I>Licensing policy</I></p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/16">In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1452 (2002), the Treasury operates a licensing system whereby designated persons and others are able to apply to make or receive payments under specific and, if necessary, monitored conditions. In this quarter, the following licences were issued:</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/17">four listed persons were granted basic expenses licences; three of which were for benefits payments;four listed persons were granted extraordinary expenses licences; and23 listed persons were granted legal expenses licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/18">In addition, the households of two listed persons were granted benefits licences in accordance with the policy I set out in my Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase> to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/19" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> The detail that can be provided to the House on a quarterly basis is subject to the need to avoid the identification, directly or indirectly, of personal or operationally sensitive information.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/20" class="indent"><sup>2</sup> This figure includes $58,000 of suspected terrorist funds frozen in the UK. This has been converted using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in the exchange rate may impact on the contribution this sum makes to future totals of suspected terrorist funds frozen.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.1/2">I deplore the activities of so-called vulture funds that seek to profit from debts owed by the poorest countries in the world. I am determined to limit the damage done by such funds. The UK will therefore:</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/3">call on the World Bank to make the IDA debt reduction facility available to HIPCs before they reach decision point, in order to help countries to eliminate their commercial debts at the earliest possible opportunity and thereby reduce the likelihood of debts being sold on to aggressive creditors;stand ready to scale up our contribution to the debt reduction facility in support of this policy change;take forward talks with leading commercial creditors on a voluntary code of conduct that will set out the actions that responsible creditors should take to help reduce the risk of litigation, including the requirement to participate in collective action to reduce unsustainable debts;work with our G8 partners to develop a charter on responsible lending that includes a commitment to protect developing countries from vulture fund activity;work to ensure that HIPCs have access to the legal assistance they need to defend themselves against litigation, including by supporting proposals at the African Development Bank to develop a legal assistance facility to help countries facing legal action gain access to technical and legal support; andcontinue to strengthen debt management capacity among HIPCs.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/4">I will also take forward discussions with my international partners on this issue, including at the G8 finance Ministers' summit in Potsdam.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.3/11"><I>Sudan</I></p>

Although the Government of Sudan have accepted the second phase of the UN support for the African Union peacekeeping force, they have yet to accept the third phase, a hybrid African Union/UN force. The conclusions of the April GAERC maintain EU pressure on Khartoum to accept the full African Union/UN peacekeeping force as well as the ceasefire and reinvigorated political process agreed in Addis Ababa last November.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.3/19">Romania has asked to discuss the Black Sea region. The Government broadly support the Commission's Black Sea strategy, which gives an overview of the policy challenges in the region, and the EU's approach to the region and proposes co-operation with regional organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/20"><I>Iran</I></p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/21">The High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana is expected to brief the council on his recent meeting with Ali Larijani, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-25">25 April</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.63.3/27">The council is expected to discuss the quartet's meeting with the Arab League on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-04">4 May</phrase> and ways to build on increasing Arab involvement. The council is also likely to discuss the political situation in Israel following the Winograd inquiry and ways to build the capacity of Palestinian institutions, including the re-engagement of the EUPOL COPPS (the EU's police mission in the Palestinian Territories), which the Government support as a key to success in the wider political process.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.3/29">We expect the council to discuss Kosovo and Serbia.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/30">The February council conclusions set out the EU's support for former President Ahtisaari's proposals on Kosovo's status and make the restart of stabilisation and association agreement talks with Serbia conditional on concrete action by a new Serb Government on co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

	<p pid="b.63.3/37"><I>European Security and Defence Policy Mission in Afghanistan</I></p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/38">The council is expected to discuss a civilian European security and defence policy mission to Afghanistan in policing with links to the wider rule of law. This is likely to be launched in Kabul on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-15">15 June</phrase>. The Government strongly support the mission as an important contribution to stability and development in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/39"><I>Security Sector Reform in the Democratic Republic of Congo</I></p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/40">The council is expected to discuss progress on security sector reform in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Much of the Government's support in this sector is channelled through the EU security sector reform advisory mission (EUSEC Congo) and the EU police mission to Kinshasa (EUPOL Kinshasa). With the formation of a new Government, the EU is seeking to modify the mandates of the two missions to ensure that support is in line with the needs of the Congolese. The Government hope that in the future the two missions will combine to look at the security sector as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/41">Defence Ministers</p>

The council is expected to adopt conclusions expressing the EU's commitment to further strengthening co-operation with the UN. The Government support this commitment. Improving the EU's ability to co-operate with key international organisations, including the UN, is key to achieving the effective multilateral system, referred to in the European security strategy, for dealing with crises on a global basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/45"><I>Lessons Learned from EUFOR RD Congo</I></p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/46">The council is expected to discuss the lessons learnt from EUFOR RD Congo. The Government support ongoing work to address the lessons learnt and believe this process will be a valuable contribution leading to improvements in future mission planning.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.3/55">The council is expected to discuss ongoing work on a possible revision of the EU military rapid response concept, based on a tri-presidency (Germany, Portugal, Slovenia) Food for Thought paper. The council is expected to adopt conclusions noting that the Battlegroups initiative has achieved full operational capability from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>. The Government support efforts to improve the EU's ability to react quickly to an emerging crisis, and is pleased with the progress of the Battlegroups initiative, championed during the UK presidency in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/56"><I>Headline Goal Process</I></p>
	<p pid="b.63.3/57">The presidency is expected to update the council on progress made on the headline goal process to strengthen European defence capabilities.

	<p pid="b.63.3/61">The presidency will submit a report to the council, setting out the progress made on military capability development over the past six months. The council is expected to note this in the conclusions.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.3/64">The council is expected to discuss a communication on a future joint Commission/member states' strategy for delivering effective aid for trade commitments. The strategy will include a road map for the delivery of the Commission's and member states' commitments to each increase trade-related assistance to &euro;1 billion by 2010 (&euro;2 billion in total). The council will also be invited to discuss progress in negotiations on economic partnership agreements (EPAs). The council is also expected to adopt conclusions. The Government will be urging donors to empower developing countries to demand increased aid for trade and will work to ensure that the EU market access offer is not diluted.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/2">Today, the department is publishing a report from the Chief Nursing Officer on progress with mixed-sex accommodation in hospitals. This report highlights the actions the National Health Service should take to improve the provision of single-sex accommodation, and includes practical advice for trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/3">The chief executive of the NHS, David Nicholson, has reiterated our commitment to single-sex accommodation by including it in the operating framework for the NHS for 2007-08. In addition, strategic health authorities (SHAs) have been asked to review performance in this area, and have been working with a number of trusts to agree plans for improvement. SHAs are also publishing statements today on the position in their region.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/4">Patients expect the NHS to deliver high standards of privacy and dignity that include, but are not restricted to, single-sex accommodation. Single-sex accommodation should be the norm in elective care, and remains the ideal for emergency treatment. However, we recognise that sometimes the need to treat and admit must take priority&mdash;the NHS will not turn a patient away just because a &quot;right sex&quot; bed is not immediately available.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/5">Copies of the Chief Nursing Officer's report have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.69.3/2">The lifespan of the Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation is to be extended by three years to 2014, following a public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/3">The Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation was established to lead a step change in Thurrock, harnessing the opportunities presented by growth and regeneration to encourage new businesses and jobs, to develop new homes, schools and leisure activities, and to encourage good quality accessible services and a robust social infrastructure in support of a prosperous community. This lifespan extension will provide the corporation with the necessary time to overcome barriers and challenges to the achievement of these aspirations, allowing it to build on their significant progress to date. Through continued joint working with Thurrock council and other partner organisations, the TTGDC will be able to make the most of Thurrock for all members of the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/4">Thurrock is a key part of the Thames Gateway and the lifespan extension will help the development corporation to deliver effectively its proposed business plan, regeneration strategy and to promote key projects in the borough.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/5">To inform the decision, a public consultation was undertaken from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-02">2 October</phrase> to the end of December 2006, seeking views from those consulted originally when the Thurrock Development Corporation was established. The vast majority of the responses were positive, recognising the challenges faced by the development corporation in Thurrock.
