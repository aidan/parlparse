	Attorney-General: Guidelines on Acceptance of Pleas
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-10-20a.59.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51020-32.htm#51020-32_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.59.1/1">The purpose of this Ministerial Statement is to inform the House that I am tomorrow publishing my revised guidelines on acceptance of pleas and the prosecutors' role in the sentencing exercise; and launching the Prosecutor's Pledge. I am placing copies of both documents in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">The new guidelines develop and build on the previous Attorney-General's guidelines on the acceptance of pleas published in 2000. They provide more detailed practical guidance for prosecutors, particularly in relation to the sentencing hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3">The Prosecutor's Pledge for the first time brings together in a single document, in the public domain, the level of service that victims can expect to receive from prosecutors. The 10 point pledge commitments will be applicable to all prosecuting authorities in due course, and will also apply to advocates instructed by the prosecution authorities. The pledge will first be introduced by the CPS. Other prosecutors will apply the principles set out in the pledge to develop their own policies, adapting them as appropriate to meet the needs of their own particular cases and responsibilities.</p>

	Peers' Subsistence and Office Cost Allowances

	<p pid="a.60.1/1">The resolution of the House of <phrase class="date" code="1994-07-20">20 July 1994</phrase> provided for the limits of the subsistence and office cost allowances to be uprated annually on <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase> in line with the increase in the retail prices index over the previous 12 months to July.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/2">Accordingly, the limits within which Lords may be reimbursed expenses incurred were increased with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-01">1 August 2005</phrase>. The new limits are now as follows (the limits previously applicable are shown in brackets).</p>

	Support for British Nationals Abroad
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-10-20a.60.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="60"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51020-32.htm#51020-32_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.60.3/1">Falling sick, being a victim of crime or facing an emergency are traumatic events under any circumstances. When such problems happen abroad they can be even more difficult and frightening. So there is no more important task for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) than its work to support British nationals in distress overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/2">British people now make some 65 million overseas trips a year, and some 13 million British nationals live overseas. Those numbers continue to increase, not least due to cheaper and easier travel and trade and the increasing diversity of our own societies.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/3">Thankfully, the vast majority of those British nationals who travel and live abroad do so without serious difficulty. However, a number of factors have led over the past years to a steady increase in demand for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's consular assistance to British nationals in difficulty. Among these factors are the growth in travel and especially in independent travel to more exotic and sometimes dangerous destinations; an increase in trips by more vulnerable groups such as the elderly; the rise of international terrorism; and the increasing number of British nationals caught up in natural catastrophes around the world such as the Indian Ocean tsunami or the recent hurricanes in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/4">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has worked hard over the past years to respond to these challenges. Rapid-deployment teams are on stand-by to provide support in crises affecting British nationals around the world: they now include the first new regional teams, based in Hong Kong, which were deployed only a week after their launch to deal with British victims of the terrorist atrocities in Bali on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>. The FCO in London has greatly expanded the capacity of its 24-hour response centre to deal with such crises. We have reviewed and implemented changes to our travel advice to help people better make informed decisions about their safety overseas. We are ensuring that all our staff overseas have the right training in crisis management, and working more closely with organisations such as the police and the Red Cross.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/5">British consular staff now deal with some 3.5 million inquiries and some 85,000 new cases requiring more acute support every year. Over the past year they included some 4,200 British nationals hospitalised overseas; 3,900 deaths; around 150 cases of child abduction and 250 of forced marriage; and support to almost 6,000 British detainees. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office issues travel advice notices on 217 countries and territories; our travel advice website receives 400,000 visitors a month. Our call centre receives some 8,000 calls every month, with flexible arrangements in place quickly to increase capacity to deal with major crises. FCO posts overseas issue more than 450,000 full British passports every year, plus 11,500 emergency passports. Foreign Office staff also provide specific services such as the <i>hajj</i> delegation to assist British pilgrims to the holy places of the Islamic faith, and special deployments for major sporting events abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/6">In its manifesto for the last General Election, the Government committed themselves, if elected, to consulting widely before drawing up a comprehensive statement of the consular assistance which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office can provide to British travellers and residents in difficulty overseas. Such a comprehensive guide to this support has not previously been available in a single document.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/7">By consulting our stakeholders before the formal launch of the document, we hope to achieve two main objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/8">to ensure that we present this guide to our consular assistance in the best way possible. Our aim is to raise public awareness of what support our consular staff can offer to British nationals in difficulty overseas, and of the constraints on that help imposed; for example, by the very different conditions in which we operate around the world; and</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/9">to foster a wider debate on the questions underlying our services. For example, to what extent should public money be used to help those who have got into difficulty abroad, including those who have not taken out appropriate insurance? How can we help British travellers and residents overseas better protect themselves against things going wrong?</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/10">I am today making available to stakeholders&mdash;including representatives from the travel and insurance industries, non-governmental organisations, departments across government and organisations with which we work to deliver consular assistance&mdash;a draft text of the guide, in preparation for a consultative event to be held at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>. I am also placing copies of the text in the Libraries of both Houses and in the Printed Paper Office. Noble Lords who would like further copies, or who wish to attend the <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase> event, should contact Katey Ma in the Consular Directorate, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London SW1A 2PA; katey.ma@fco.gov.uk or telephone 020 7008 1213.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.3/11">I would above all welcome the views of noble Lords on the issues raised in this statement. Comments from noble Lords should be sent to me at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Following the consultation I hope to make a further Statement to the House to launch the final text.</p>
