<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-17a.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="67"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71217-wms0001.htm#0712176000025">
	<p pid="a.67.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-12">12 June 2007</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government made a Statement to the House in which she outlined the independent investigation procedure that was taking place into the incident and the availability of reports produced by the investigation board, including recommendations relating to the design and operation of the fuel storage site. She said that a report with recommendations on emergency planning, response and recovery was in preparation.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/3">In response to a recent request (Business Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>) from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the honourable Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase>, the Leader of the House has asked for a further Statement on progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">The Buncefield Major Incident Investigation Board published its report and recommendations on emergency preparedness for, response to and recovery from major incidents on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-17">17 July</phrase>. It has also published a report on safety and environmental standards for fuel storage sites, and one from its Explosion Mechanism Advisory Group that advocates a joint industry research project be initiated to explain the severity of the explosion that occurred at the site. Copies of these, and other earlier reports, are available from the official investigation website at <a href="http://www.buncefieldinvestigation.gov.uk">www.buncefieldinvestigation.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/5">The report published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-17">17 July</phrase> made a number of recommendations in four areas: reassessing major incident scenarios; managing major incidents on-site; preparing for and responding to major incidents off-site; and planning for recovery from major incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/6">Although set in the context of the Buncefield incident, the recommendations, particularly those relating to emergency preparedness and response, can be applied beyond fuel storage and distribution sites. Many of these are complex and far-reaching. They need to be considered at a wider, national level and reflect the co-ordinated views of the different departments, and the devolved Administrations, that have responsibility for them. The Government will be responding formally to these recommendations in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/7">I can comment on some issues that are specific to the Buncefield depot.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/8">The report recommends that all relevant organisations should be involved with recovery at an early stage. Such joint working has already delivered financial and practical support to aid recovery through the Bellwin scheme (which was extended beyond its usual duration), and ongoing support from the East of England Development Agency which has also provided financial assistance of &pound;4.4 million to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/9">The East of England Development Agency is also working closely with stakeholders developing proposals to designate the area as a new town improvement district. Under this programme local partners aim to bring together a combination of funding mechanisms that could help finance some of the major improvements identified in the Maylands Business Park masterplan.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/10">Hemel Hempstead is one of 21 urban areas identified in the Secretary of State's proposed changes to the East of England Plan, the regional strategy, as key centres for development and change at which additional development will be focused. The proposed changes include a requirement for an additional 12,000 homes in Dacorum, including expansion of Hemel Hempstead.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/11">As part of the Comprehensive Spending Review outcomes, the Government announced &pound;1.7 billion of investment in the growth areas, growth points and eco-towns over the CSR period. Local authorities in existing growth areas and growth points were invited to prepare programmes of development setting out what additional infrastructure and other funding they sought from the Government to support housing delivery over the next three years (2008-2011). In view of the housing targets set out in the Secretary of State's proposed changes Dacorum Borough Council was invited to submit a programme of development for the support it would require to deliver the proposed housing growth, with the intention that, subject to the final RSS, Dacorum would be brought into the growth areas programme to allow it to receive infrastructure and delivery support from the growth fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-04">4 December</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Minister for Housing announced &pound;732 million for local authorities in growth areas and growth points for infrastructure to support housing growth. Based on its submitted programme of development, Dacorum Borough Council has received a provisional award of &pound;2,554,062 capital and &pound;159,377 revenue in 2008-09, and an indicative provisional award of &pound;3,575,687 capital and &pound;239,034 revenue for the period 2009-10 to 2010-11. In line with local government White Paper principles, the Government's new approach to growth funding gives local authorities flexibility in how they use the funding they receive, so it can be used where they judge it will be most effective. This provisional funding award is subject to Dacorum being brought into the growth areas as a result of the final form of the regional spatial strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/13">The honourable member for St Albans (Anne Main MP) recently asked about the reopening of the Buncefield site. In his reply the Minister of State for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform stated that the Buncefield site is of strategic importance for the supply of aviation fuel to Heathrow and Gatwick airports. He stated that a number of applications for planning permission to restore operations at the Buncefield site had been submitted to Dacorum Borough Council and that at these had yet to be determined. (<I>Hansard</I> <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">26 November 2007</phrase>, col 119W)</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/14">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-29">29 November</phrase>, Dacorum Borough Council's Development Control Committee considered these applications. The committee resolved that decisions on five of the six applications considered should be delegated to officials with a view to planning permission being approved, subject to completion of a planning obligation under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Approval would be for storage and supply of aviation fuel only. The planning obligations would restrict storage and supply of ground fuels until a future date. Negotiations on the planning obligations are a matter for Dacorum and the oil companies, on which it would be inappropriate to comment. Similarly, the future use and development of the Buncefield site is matter for the oil companies and, in the first instance, Dacorum Borough Council to whom applications for planning permission would be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/15">The Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency are statutory consultees in the planning process and will ensure the planning authority has expert advice should applications be made. They are also joint competent authorities for major hazard sites, regulated under the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations, before operations were able to resume the site operators would have to satisfy these authorities that the site would adhere to the highest operating standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.1/3">The Cabinet Secretary has provided an interim progress report, which I have today placed in the Library of the House.</p>

This is based on consolidation of existing commitments, rigorous conditionality and improved communication on the benefits of enlargement. The Council agreed that chapters for which technical preparations have been completed will be opened, and reaffirmed that the pace of negotiations depends on accession states making the necessary reforms.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-17a.72.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="72"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71217-wms0001.htm#0712176000067">
	<p pid="a.72.1/1">The Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council was held in Brussels on 6 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-07">7 December 2007</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Jack Straw); my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Bridget Prentice); the Solicitor-General for Scotland (Frank Mulholland); and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Meg Hillier) attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The following issues were discussed at the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/2">The council opened with a jumbo meeting of Interior and Employment Ministers who met to discuss the links between migration, employment and the Lisbon agenda. Commissioner Frattini highlighted legal migration as key to delivering the Lisbon agenda and addressing the demographic challenges facing the EU. The UK underlined our commitment to the Lisbon agenda and stated that the key to achieving it was to increase labour market participation, ensure national flexibility in legal migration, combat illegal migration and ensure that integration and cohesion issues were taken into account in legal migration policy development. Every member state intervened and consistent themes emerged similar to those made by the UK but, in general, member states felt that these decisions were primarily for individual states.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/3">The council then moved on to the mixed committee which included Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. The presidency began by congratulating all concerned on the historic achievement of the extension of the Schengen acquis to the member states who joined the European Union in 2004.There were also updates on the Schengen Information System (SIS) communication network which was still on schedule to be completed within the prescribed timescale and the SIS II programme. The presidency spoke of the two key issues surrounding the SIS II programme: the overall timescale and the migration of data. The migration issue will be discussed at the informal JHA Council of the Slovenian presidency in January. The Commission said the timescale for delivery of SIS II in December 2008 was still technically possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/4">There was a report on the progress made on the directive for common standards and procedures in member states for returning illegally staying third-country nationals. As we are not yet convinced of the need for common standards in this area, the UK has not opted into this directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/5">The main agenda began with agreement to council conclusions on mobility partnerships and circular migration in the framework of the global approach to migration. The presidency compromise was accepted after some textual amendments were made at the request of one member state to ensure that references to circular migration were not becoming permanent.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/6">Interior Ministers attended a presidency lunch with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Antonio Gutteres. He set out the UNHCR's expectations of the next stage of the common European asylum system (CEAS) and urged greater international co-operation between countries in regions of origin, transit and arrival. The Commission announced the results of the Green Paper on the second phase of the CEAS and detailed its timetable for proposals next year. The UK urged caution in timing of the second phase of the CEAS.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/7">The report on the implementation of the counter-terrorism strategy was introduced by the presidency and the new EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator, Gilles de Kerchove. He focused on the exchange of information and emphasised the importance of member states fulfilling their commitments under the 2005 decision on sharing information with Europol and Eurojust. Gilles de Kerchove commented on the importance of creating synergies between, for example, police, customs and judicial information and outlined the development, of &quot;check the web&quot;, common principles of data protection, and the implementation of council decisions. The presidency agreed with Gilles de Kerchove on the importance of the relationship between Europol and Eurojust and work with the US. Work on these and other areas will continue under the Slovenian presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/8">The presidency welcomed the first reading agreement on the weapons directive with the European Parliament. The UK congratulated the presidency on this outcome. There had been raids in Manchester seizing real and imitation firearms and this clearly underlined the importance of this issue. It is hoped this will be adopted under the Slovenian presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/9">The presidency hoped to conclude Chapters VI, VII and IX of the Europol council decision, subject to the outcome of decisions on budget neutrality, bold posts and immunity. However, after the UK and other member states confirmed their continuing parliamentary scrutiny reserves and member states raised further concerns about the voting regime, it was concluded that that these areas would need to be resolved at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/10">The incoming Slovenian presidency congratulated the Portuguese on its achievements, particularly on SISOne4All. It announced that under its presidency, it would continue to take forward work on Europol, Pr&uuml;m, the weapons directive, readmission agreements and CEAS. It also set out its future presidency programme and announced that its informal council would take place in January at Brdo Castle.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/11">The presidency also announced that the EU could now support the European day against the death penalty as all reserves had been lifted. It would be celebrated on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-10">10 October</phrase> every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/12">The presidency introduced the proposal to update the 2002 framework decision on combating terrorism to bring it in line with the Council of Europe convention. This was an important subject matter, and there was a delicate balance to be achieved to ensure that fundamental rights were protected while terrorism was effectively tackled. The Commission emphasised the importance of responding to terrorist use of the internet as a criminal matter not as freedom of expression. Most member states welcomed the proposed changes to the framework decision and the Commission's comments on the dividing line between freedom of expression and criminal acts.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/13">The presidency presented achievements so far in work on e.Justice. The Commission will increase funding in 2008 and produce a communication in May/June setting up an overall e.Justice strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/14">The presidency confirmed agreement to the latest text on choice of law in contractual obligations (Rome I). The Government consider that the text now improves on the Rome convention and addresses earlier concerns about potential loss of legal and financial services to other jurisdictions. The UK will consult its stakeholders, as soon as possible, as to whether it should, now, opt in to the text.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/15">The council conclusions on Eurojust were adopted without debate. Slovenia announced it would address the issues raised during its presidency. The Government support the conclusions but have made it clear previously that any future proposals should focus on ensuring that Eurojust fulfils its potential within its current powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/16">A general approach was reached on mutual recognition of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences. The Government considered that the text balanced the different interests of member states and respected the differences between legal systems, while remaining proportionate. Accordingly, the UK was able to support a general approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/17">The presidency gave an update on the framework decision of the European supervision order and confirmed that it was finalising the draft text in co-operation with the Commission and the incoming presidencies on the basis of the mandate provided from the September JHA Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/18">The presidency reported that the recent EU-Russia JHA Ministerial had gone well and included discussions on narcotics, particularly from Afghanistan, and the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding on financial crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/19">The two common positions on the review mechanism and asset recovery in relation to the UN Convention Against Corruption were noted briefly by the presidency but no member state intervened.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/20">The presidency noted the successful outcome of the diplomatic session on the Hague Convention on Maintenance and observed that this text was a good basis for work on the Community's draft regulation on the same topic.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/21">The presidency announced the important outcomes achieved at the European-Mediterranean migration summit.

	<p pid="a.75.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/2">I have today published a summary of responses received in response to the Government's stakeholder consultation document <I>Modernising Empty Property Relief</I>, and have placed a copy in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/3">The Government's proposals for reforms to empty property relief were part of a package of measures introduced in the Budget to help incentivise the efficient use of land, to help increase the supply of commercial property and to reduce costs for businesses. The Government consider that the reforms provide a strong incentive for owners to reuse, relet or redevelop their empty shops, offices and factory buildings, and so improve access to property and reduce rents for businesses. The Rating (Empty Properties) Act 2007, which received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July</phrase>, gave effect to these reforms, and set a revised empty property rate of 100 per cent of the basic occupied rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/4">Having considered the responses received to our consultation document, I can confirm that the Government will now take forward a number of additional measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/5">The consultation document sought views on whether the existing permanent exemption from empty property rates available to listed buildings and those with a statutory protection should continue, or whether it should be varied. I have concluded that, on the available evidence, there can be a greater degree of work involved in bringing empty listed properties back into beneficial use compared to other properties and that the evidence supports such properties continuing to benefit from an exemption from empty property rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/6">I have also concluded that companies in administration should benefit from a permanent exemption from empty property rates. This will bring them into line with companies that are in liquidation and individuals subject to bankruptcy proceedings. We are committed to the promotion of a rescue culture which provides opportunities for insolvent companies that have viable underlying businesses to be rescued wherever possible. A permanent exemption will remove any potential for decisions about whether to enter administration to be distorted by differences in rates liability.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/7">I have considered carefully the responses to the consultation document about the potential risk of owners of empty property taking measures to avoid payment of rates on their property. The Rating (Empty Properties) Act 2007 gave the Secretary of State, and the Welsh Ministers, the power to make regulations to tackle any such activity. The consultation document set out a number of options as to how such regulations might be constructed if the Secretary of State were minded to make them.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/8">There was a substantial body of comment about the proposed measures. I have concluded, on the basis of those responses, that the likely incidence of avoidance activity following the introduction of the reforms to empty property relief is low. It would be an extreme step for a property owner to go to the lengths of deliberately vandalising a potentially valuable asset so that it is beyond economic repair. This view was expressed by a number of respondents to the consultation document.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/9">Having taken account of all the responses, I have concluded that the existing circumstances do not warrant the introduction of anti-avoidance regulations at this stage. However, I am clear that, if it appears that there is evidence of measures being taken by owners of empty property to avoid payment of empty property rates, the Government will not hesitate to use their powers. We will work with the Local Government Association, the Valuation Office Agency and the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation to monitor the impact of the reforms and assess whether regulations should be introduced in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/10">We are now working on drafting the relevant secondary legislation to give effect to our reforms on empty property relief. This includes introducing the new six-month exemption from empty property rates for vacant industrial and warehouse properties, as announced in the 2007 Budget. We intend to lay this secondary legislation before Parliament so that all aspects of our reforms to empty property relief can come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-12-17a.90.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="90"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71217-wms0004.htm#0712176000787">
	<p pid="a.90.1/1">My right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/2">Following representations by political parties in Northern Ireland, the Government commissioned Sir David Varney in March 2007 to carry out a review of tax policy in Northern Ireland. His terms of reference were to examine &quot;how current and future tax policy, including the tax changes announced in the Budget 2007, can support the sustainable growth of businesses and long-term investment in Northern Ireland&quot;. The review has been published today and has been deposited in the Library of the House. I am very grateful to Sir David Varney and his team, and to all those who submitted evidence to the review. Sir David's report provides a valuable assessment not only of business tax issues for Northern Ireland but also of how the opportunities and challenges facing the devolved Administration in developing an investment strategy might best be approached. The Government are fully committed to supporting the Northern Ireland Executive in implementing such a strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/3">The Government recognise that, in developing their economic investment strategy, the question of business tax levels in the UK is a particularly important issue for the Executive. I am therefore particularly grateful to Sir David and his team for the considerable depth in which this issue is analysed and explored in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/4">He concludes that a policy of a preferential corporation tax rate for Northern Ireland, as compared to the rest of the UK, does not offer the best way forward for building a strong investment strategy for Northern Ireland. He is not convinced that a cut would represent good value for money. In particular, the role of supply side factors needed to be paid due attention, and caution taken on the responsiveness of investment to a cut in the rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/5">The review examines the tax position in Northern Ireland, in both its international context and in comparison with the Republic of Ireland. It finds that the UK compares favourably with its G7 partners in terms of corporate tax levels. It also finds that the UK has a lower rate of tax than the Republic in areas such as VAT and the top rate of income tax, and offers more generous R and D tax credits and tax relief on dividends.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/6">The review recommends a strategy to develop private sector investment in Northern Ireland based on maximising the benefits of the competitive advantages that already exist in Northern Ireland, including current financial investment incentives, and realising the potential further to improve this competitive advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/7">The report notes that for many years the Northern Ireland economy has been over-reliant on public sector investment for its growth but that political progress over the past 10 years to end conflict and to transform Northern Ireland to a peaceful, stable society has already helped attract inward private sector investment. The restoration of devolution on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May</phrase> is a major turning point and incentive for such further inward investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/8">The report identifies Northern Ireland's key competitive advantages as including:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/9">operating costs which are highly competitive and significantly lower than in the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland;a well developed telecoms infrastructure providing important benefits for business;one of the youngest populations in Europe and high educational achievements; andattractive financial incentives, recruitment and training, research and development and other development support tailored to each company's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/10">The report recommends that these advantages can be maximised by a strategy to:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/11">further improve basic and technical skills and retaining the best and the brightest;tackle the size of the public sector and efficiency of the administration;foster innovation through better university and business collaborations; andprioritise trade and investment promotion across government, including working links between Invest Northern Ireland, the Irish Investment and Development Agency and UK Trade and Investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/12">In short, Sir David Varney's report found that the conditions for economic success for Northern Ireland are more than a matter of tax incentives. There are lessons in terms of improving labour force participation, basic skills, and efficiency and organisation in the public sector; and Northern Ireland needs to move towards the execution of a strategy focussed on business and economic development.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/13">In the light of Sir David Varney's report, the Government are working with the Executive to:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/14">strengthen trade and investment promotion by UK Trade and Investment reviewing with Invest Northern Ireland the scope for better marketing of Northern Ireland to higher value-added FDI; andpromote closer working between the UK Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government to promote a coherent overall science strategy, including considering the suggestion of creating &quot;science cities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/15">This will build on the May 2007 settlement, elements of which specifically focus on issues highlighted in the review as key to a sound and forward-looking investment strategy:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/16">an innovation fund focusing particularly on levering in private sector investment and promoting collaborative research. This includes matched funding of &pound;36 million from the Irish Government targeted specifically on collaborative research and development;a new Northern Ireland corporate tax office to promote the competitive tax position;a local employment partnership that will help create 5,000 jobs for the unemployed in Northern Ireland between five leading employers in the retail sector. The expansion of this initiative to other sectors, including security, hospitality and facilities management, offers the Northern Ireland Executive further opportunity to work with employers to maximise the opportunities for those in Northern Ireland who are inactive or unemployed; and a major conference in Northern Ireland for prospective investors from the USA, led by the Executive and fully supported by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/17">The Northern Ireland Executive has put growing the economy at the top of its priorities. This is reflected in the draft programme for Government which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October 2007</phrase>, along with a draft investment strategy and draft budget for 2008-11. I welcome the strategy that this programme sets for building economic success to benefit all communities in Northern Ireland, including the good progress that is being made towards the planned US inward investment conference next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/18">I have discussed the report and next steps with the executive and I am today announcing that Sir David Varney has agreed to carry out a further review building on his first review and focusing on identifying policies and incentives for strengthening and sustaining private sector growth, investment and employment in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/19">Against that background and the desire of the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to work in partnership to create the conditions for sustained economic growth and increased employment opportunities for all, the terms of reference for the second review are:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/20" class="indent">&quot;In the light of Sir David Varney's review of tax policy in Northern Ireland, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-17">17 December</phrase> and the Northern Ireland Executive's draft Programme for Government and draft Budget published in October 2007, Sir David Varney will undertake a second review. Building on Sir David's earlier analysis and agreement from all parties about the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland (in relation to the opportunities provided by the peace process, the need to strengthen the private sector, to create increased employment opportunities and to reform the public sector) this review will explore in more detail how to expand the private sector and to enhance Northern Ireland's competitiveness. In this context, the review will look at incentives for supporting the sustainable growth of businesses, investment and employment in Northern Ireland and the implications for reducing the historic dependency on the public sector. This will include examination of incentives for growth in Northern Ireland that fall within the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government. Sir David will aim to report in good time for the US investment conference. He will be supported by a small secretariat and will receive direct and regular input from Northern Ireland Executive officials&quot;.</p>
