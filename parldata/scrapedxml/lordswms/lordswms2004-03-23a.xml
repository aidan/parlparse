	Licensing Act 2003: Section 182 Draft Guidance
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-03-23a.35.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100399" speakername="Lord McIntosh of Haringey" colon=":" colnum="35"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040323/text/40323-40.htm#40323-40_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.35.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/2">I am today laying before Parliament a draft of the guidance to be issued by me under Section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003. I am also placing copies in the Libraries of both Houses, the Vote Office, and the Printed Paper Office. Copies will be made available to the public on the DCMS website at: <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/alcohol-and-entertainment/licensing-act-2003">www.culture.gov.uk/alcohol&ndash;and&ndash;entertainment/licensing&ndash;act&ndash;2003</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3">The guidance makes clear our determination to enable licensing authorities and the police to bring the minority of badly run premises into line with the best. The police and other responsible authorities should make full use of existing and new powers under the Act proactively tackling alcohol-related crime and disorder and badly run premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/4">In carrying out their functions under the Act, licensing authorities have a clear responsibility to promote the prevention of crime and disorder, and the prevention of public nuisance, as well as to promote public safety and protect children from harm.</p>

	Fine Enforcement
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-03-23a.36.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="36"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040323/text/40323-40.htm#40323-40_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.36.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/2">Improving fine enforcement performance is an important part of maintaining public confidence in the criminal justice system. Justice must be done, and must be seen to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/3">To this end, we are launching a national initiative to target those who have defaulted on criminal penalties imposed by the courts. The initiative, called Operation Payback, will see magistrates' courts across England and Wales conducting blitzes against serious fines defaulters in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/4">The operation means that money owed to the court, and therefore the taxpayer, and compensation owed to victims, is collected. The Government are sending a clear message to those who have been fined that payment is not optional and that penalties must be paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/5">The national operation is being co-ordinated by the Department for Constitutional Affairs with support from the police and the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
