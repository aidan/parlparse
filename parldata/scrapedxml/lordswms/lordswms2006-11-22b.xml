Having now concluded our search for all information relevant to the 2002 programme, I can confirm that we no longer hold the specific material originally referred to byDr MacShane. I apologise that we are therefore unable to provide this to the House of Commons Library. We have, however, placed excerpts from official correspondence relating to the 2002 programme in the House of Commons Library. This information has been the subject of a separate freedom of information request.</p>
