	Sudan: African Union Mission
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-01-08a.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70108-wms0001.htm#07010821000008">
	<p pid="a.1.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">The British Government will provide a further&pound;15 million to support the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">The AMIS force of 7,000 carries out vital operations in Darfur, and in very difficult circumstances. It relies upon the support of the international community to fund its operations, and the UK has been a leading contributor since its deployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/4">A high-level consultation on Darfur was held in Addis Ababa on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-16">16 November 2006</phrase>. It concluded that the UN needs to provide increased support to AMTS, to enhance its effectiveness and ability to protect the civilians of Darfur and implement the Darfur peace agreement (DPA) signed on <phrase class="date" code="">5 May</phrase>. This UN support will come in three phases, culminating in a joint AU/UN peacekeeping force of 17,000 with 3,000 police. This will require sustainable funding, and the UN Secretary-General will request that this comes from the UN. In the mean time, the AU Peace and Security Council met on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>: it endorsed the Addis Ababa conclusions and extended the mandate of AMIS for a further six months from<phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase>. But this extension is conditional upon sufficient funding from the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/5">The African Union estimates the cost of extending AMIS's mandate to continue its current operations and to implement expansions under the DPA as$343 million (&pound; 175 million). Finding these funds will require a concerted international effort, and the UK is fully committed to playing its part. As an important donor to AMIS and in recognition of the urgentneed to sustain its work, the UK will give a further &pound;15 million to support the force for its extended mandate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/6">This contribution puts the total British assistance to AMIS for this financial year to &pound;35 million. The previously committed &pound;20 million has been funding ground fuel contracts, airlift for Nigerian and Rwandan battalions and military observers. It also includes a cash contribution of &pound;13.5 million to cover personnel and catering costs for the period October to December. These are vital running costs for AMIS to continue its operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/7">As well as taking a lead in committing UK funds, we are also encouraging other donors to make new pledges to sustain the mission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr Kim Howells) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/2">Members will wish to be aware of the outcome of the Sixth Review Conference of States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention held in Geneva from <phrase class="date" code="">20 November</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase>, states party agreed a three-part final document which included a final declaration where states declared their continued commitment to the convention and their determination to exclude completely the possibility of the use of biological weapons. States party reviewed the operation of the convention and expressed their views on all its articles in some detail. Importantly, states party agreed that the prohibitions in Article I, which defines thescope of the convention, apply to all scientific and technological developments in the life sciences and in other fields of science relevant to the convention that have no peaceful purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/4">The conference also:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/5">endorsed the work done between 2003 and 2005 by states party on five specific topics relevant to the convention;established a three-person implementation support unit based in the UN in Geneva, to perform specific tasks in support of states party and to serve as a focal point;agreed that where possible states should submit their confidence-building measure (CBM) returns electronically and that they should be circulated between states party electronically;agreed to a concerted effort by states party to persuade other states to join the convention; andagreed a further inter-sessional work programme for 2007-10 to discuss:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/6"><I>in 2007</I></p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/7">ways and means to enhance national implementation, including enforcement of national legislation, strengthening of national institutions and co-ordination among national law enforcement institutions; and regional and sub-regional co-operation on BTWC implementation;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/8"><I>in 2008</I></p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/9">national, regional and international measures to improve bio-safety and bio-security, including laboratory safety and security of pathogens and toxins; andoversight, education, awareness-raising, and adoption and/or development of codes of conduct with the aim to prevent misuse in the context of advances in bio-science and technology research with the potential of use for purposes prohibited by the convention;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/10"><I>in 2009</I></p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/11">with a view to enhancing international co-operation, assistance and exchange in biological sciences and technology for peaceful purposes, promoting capacity in building in the fields of disease surveillance, detection, diagnosis and containment of infectious diseases: first, forstates parties in need of assistance, identifying requirements and requests for capacity enhancement, and, secondly, from states partiesin a position to do so, and international organisations, opportunities for providing assistance related to these fields; and<I>in 2010</I>provision of assistance and co-ordination with relevant organisations upon request by any state party in the case of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons, including improving national capabilities for disease surveillance, detection, and diagnosis and public health systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/12">The above agreement provides a good basis for future collaboration and co-ordination between states party to the convention. The United Kingdom worked closely with European Union partners and with a wide range of other states in the preparatory phase and at the conference itself to build agreement on the middle ground, which ultimately provided the basis for the final consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/13">The Government are grateful to the president of the conference, Ambassador Masood Khan of Pakistan, for his tireless efforts to achieve such a positive outcome, which we believe represents a significant success for multilateralism in the non-proliferation and disarmament field.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.1/1">My honourable friend the Economic Secretary (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">The Government's child trust fund initiative is designed to strengthen the saving habit and ensure that at age 18 every young person will have access to a financial asset. The scheme will also help bring financial education to life for children, providing a practical and real life example of saving.</p>

There are also early indications that more parents are now regularly saving for their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">However, there is more to do to reach new parents and to encourage the further involvement of parents whose child has an account. Government willbe launching child trust fund week on Monday<phrase class="date" code="">15 January</phrase> to encourage parents and families to engage with their child's account, by saving for their child's future and by using the child trust fund to help teach children about money and saving.</p>
