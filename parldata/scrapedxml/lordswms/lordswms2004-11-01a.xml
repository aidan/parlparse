	Civil Service: Sickness Absence

	<p pid="a.2.3/1">The report <i>Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service 2003</i> prepared for the Cabinet Office by Aon Limited shows that the headline figure for the average level of sickness absence was 10.0 days per staff year. This represents a 0.2 days per staff year increase over the equivalent figure of 9.8 days set out in the report for 2002. The report contains a comprehensive analysis of the 2003 figures by department/agency. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/2">Departments have established service delivery agreements, which contain their individual targets for reducing sickness absence. Overall, the Civil Service was targeted to reduce sickness absence by 30 per cent (to 7.2 days per staff year) by 2003 against the 1998 baseline. In July 2004 my right honourable friend the Chancellor announced a review into the extent of short and long-term sickness within the Civil Service, and results of that are due to be published shortly. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office is continuing to work with other departments and agencies as they take forward their plans to reduce sickness absence.</p>
