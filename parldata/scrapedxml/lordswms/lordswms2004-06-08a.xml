	Northern Ireland Health and Social Services Estates Agency: Quinquennial Review
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-06-08a.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="3"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040608/text/40608-34.htm#40608-34_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.3.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">Stage two of the Quinquennial Review for the Northern Ireland Health and Social Services Estates Agency has been completed. The report has been made available in the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Northern Ireland Assembly's Libraries and on the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3">The conclusion of the stage one report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-04">4 June 2003</phrase>, was that the Northern Ireland Health and Social Services Estates Agency should remain in being as an agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">Stage two examined how the agency operated and looked at the potential for improving the agency's future performance. The consultants invited views from a range of respondents, including the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA), HPSS boards trusts and agencies and departmental staff. Their report makes recommendations to improve the agency's effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/5">The report's overall conclusion is that much has already been done to address areas for improvement identified in the stage one report. The report recommends, however, more: monitoring of compliance with policy standards; consultation engagement in formulating and monitoring standards; practically oriented advice to the department which can influence capital plans; early engagement with the department on estate-related policy issues with wider implications for capital planning; early involvement of the agency in the development and approval of capital plans and business cases; involvement in the development of policy which may have capital implications; communication and integration across all parts of the agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/6">Implementation of the report recommendations will improve the effectiveness of the agency and will enhance the agency's ability to contribute to improvements in the quality of care to patients.</p>

	D-Day: 60th Anniversary Commemoration
</major-heading>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">I am pleased to update the House on the events planned, both in France and in the United Kingdom, to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of D-Day.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/2">The main events in Normandy on <phrase class="date" code="">5 June</phrase> are the Normandy Veterans' Association Parade and Homage to Field Marshal Montgomery in Colleville-Montgomery; a service held by the 3rd Parachute Brigade at Bavent-le-Mesnil; a tree-planting ceremony at the Royal Naval and Royal Marine Memorial in Ouistreham organised by the RN/RM Landing Craft Association; the inauguration by HRH the Prince of Wales at the Pegasus Museum of a HORSA replica glider; a parachute drop by soldiers of 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment; the inauguration of the British Garden of Remembrance at Caen; a poppy drop to the Royal British Legion's chartered vessel the MV &quot;Van Gogh&quot;; and a symbolic crossing of ships from Portsmouth to Ouistreham. Also travelling with veterans will be the winning school from our nationwide competition who will be collecting experiences from veterans before and after the events.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase>, there will be a service at Bayeux Cathedral organised by the Calvados Branch of the Royal British Legion; a bi-national ceremony at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery in Bayeux, attended by HM The Queen and President Chirac, a landing craft exhibition on GOLD Beach at Asnelles; the international event on the cliff-top above Arromanches, attended by 17 Heads of State, including a naval review, march past and fly past; the Normandy Veterans' Association Final Parade and March Past in Arromanches, attended by HM The Queen, the Duke of Gloucester, the Prime Minister, the Defence Secretary and myself, and a commemorative concert at the Abbaye Aux Hommes in Caen.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/4">Several commemorative events will take place in the United Kingdom, including a full programme organised by the City of Portsmouth during the weekend, and on <phrase class="date" code="">6 June</phrase> a service at the National Memorial Arboretum near Lichfield reflecting the event being held at Bayeux Cemetery.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/5">The Government recognise the huge significance of this anniversary to the D-Day veterans, around 8,000 of whom plan to travel to Normandy to play their part once again. We have experienced very constructive co-operation with the French authorities and the Normandy Veterans' Association. There is an extremely high level of interest in these events and limited space, especially in Arromanches town centre and Bayeux. We are working with the French authorities to alleviate any problems that may occur. Veterans, of course, will be given first priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/6">There are several schemes in place to assist those veterans who wish to return to the areas where they saw active service during the Second World War. As I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase>, the New Opportunities Fund has made available &pound;10 million of National Lottery funding to help with travel costs. The Home Office has provided free one-year passports to veterans travelling for the 60th anniversary commemorations scheme. P&amp;O Ferries has generously offered a 50 per cent reduction in ferry fares to Normandy.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/7">The role of other government departments, the Imperial War Museum and the National Lottery means that this important commemoration offers a real opportunity to pass on the baton of remembrance to future generations. A commemorative booklet (the third in a series) is being produced and will be sent to all Members of the House early next week.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/8">Despite heavy commitments in Iraq and elsewhere, around 1,000 troops will be in Normandy. Our Armed Forces today are proud to be able to offer support to the veterans and their associations of yesterday as they commemorate this important anniversary.</p>

It will greatly enhance the level of training available to our mental health specialists, and provide invaluable support to our newly enhanced community-based teams of mental health specialists.</p>
