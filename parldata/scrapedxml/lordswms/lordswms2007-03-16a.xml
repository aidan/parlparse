<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-03-16a.77.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="77"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70316-wms0001.htm#07031652000004">
	<p pid="a.77.1/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/2">I have today laid before both Houses the report by Sir Hayden Phillips, <I>Strengthening Democracy: Fair and Sustainable Funding of Political Parties</I>. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/3">I welcome Sir Hayden's report. He has negotiated his report with skill and dedication, and for this I am very grateful. I am sure that the other political parties share my gratitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/4">The report shows very clearly that there is now the basis for a new agreement on the funding and expenditure of political parties. There are a number of detailed questions that need to be taken forward, through a process of further discussion between the political parties. I hope that, following these negotiations, consensus can be reached. I haveasked Sir Hayden to chair these further discussions. I believe that they should begin soon and conclude before the Summer Recess, in order to build a platform for legislation in the next parliamentary Session.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/5">The time has come for us to find a new settlement on party funding and expenditure. I have asked my right honourable friend the Leader of the House of Commons (Jack Straw) to lead these negotiations for the Labour Party. I hope that the leaders of the other main parties will also nominate delegations to join the talks.</p>
