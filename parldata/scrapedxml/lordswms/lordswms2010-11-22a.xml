	<p pid="a.55.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-21">21 June 2010</phrase> we notified bidders that we would not be proceeding with the Work for Your Benefit pilot scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/3">The Jobseeker's Allowance (Work for your Benefit Pilot Scheme) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1222) were approved in draft by each House of Parliament in March 2010 and were made on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-07">7 April 2010</phrase>. They are due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-22">22 November 2010</phrase>, and then to lapse on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-21">21 November 2013</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.55.5/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Schools (Nick Gibb) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/2">I am announcing today that the Government will introduce a phonics screening check for children in year 1. This will be a short, light-touch screening check based on phonic decoding designed to confirm that children have grasped the basics of phonic decoding and identify those pupils who need extra help at an early stage, so that schools can provide support. The results of the test will provide valuable information to parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/3">This screening check will play a significant role in improving reading standards in our schools. Despite the hard work of teachers and pupils, a significant minority of pupils persistently underachieve-in 2010, 15 per cent of seven year-olds failed to achieve the expected level in reading. Early literacy is crucial so that children can access the whole curriculum, and are able read for enjoyment and understanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/4">The evidence shows that systematic synthetic phonics, taught in the first years of a child's education, is a highly effective way of teaching children to read. A year 1 phonics screening check will enable us to pinpoint those who are struggling with phonics at an early age so they can receive the help they need to progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.5/5">The department is launching a public consultation today asking teachers, parents and the public to submit views on how the test should be structured and administered. The screening check will be piloted in summer 2011 and rolled out nationally in the 2011-12 academic year.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.1/1">My honourable friend the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (David Gauke) has today issued the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/2">It has been brought to the Government's attention that the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) (Amendment) Order 2010 (the 2010 Order), which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-24">24 February 2010</phrase>, has unintentionally had a number of potential adverse consequences for the tax and regulatory treatment of some types of debt securities.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/3">The Government intend at the earliest practicable opportunity to make the necessary amendments in secondary legislation to restore the legal position in respect of the potentially affected debt securities. This will rectify the potential problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/4">Action will also be taken to ensure that no unintended consequences arise for the potentially affected debt securities regarding regulatory or tax treatment between the coming into force of the 2010 Order on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-24">24 February 2010</phrase>, and the date on which the remedying amendments come into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/5">HMRC has confirmed that it will take no action to establish or collect any tax liabilities that may arise from these unintended consequences. The Government will introduce as necessary legislation in the next Finance Bill to restore previous expectations about the way that potentially affected debt securities are taxed, subject to an opt-out to ensure that the retrospective application of new legislation does not increase tax liabilities.</p>

	Flooding: Cornwall
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-11-22a.57.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100286" speakername="Lord Henley" colon=":" colnum="57"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101122-wms0001.htm#1011222000019">
	<p pid="a.57.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has today made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">Members will be aware of the serious flooding that affected parts of Cornwall in particular on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-17">Wednesday 17 November</phrase>, causing disruption and distress to many people. At its height, 10 flood warnings were in place, although these have now been removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/3">The flooding was caused by very heavy rainfall from Tuesday evening onwards; 38.8 millimetres fell in one hour at Mevagissey. This resulted in significant surface water and river flooding, causing widespread travel difficulties and damage to more than 250 properties. Affected areas include St Austell, Par, Pentewan, Bodmin, Luxulyan, Lostwithiel, St Blazey, St Blazey Gate, Polgooth, Launceston, and Mevagissey. The issues faced varied from place to place, requiring different local responses. The Environment Agency intends to hold clinics in each community to address the issues and build resilience.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/4">Across Cornwall, around 3,000 properties in vulnerable areas were protected as a result of flood defence schemes. These included up to 100 on the River Fowey at Lostwithiel.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/5">An extreme rainfall alert was issued by the Flood Forecasting Centre on Tuesday afternoon, highlighting the risk of very heavy rainfall overnight. This alert allowed local authorities to prepare to respond. The emergency has rightly been dealt with by responders at the local level, who are best placed to make decisions and take action according to local needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/6">Helicopters were on standby but were not needed for flood rescue, although one medical evacuation was carried out. There was some fast-moving water, but no major injuries or missing persons have been reported. Many residents were, however, evacuated and spent the night away from home.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/7">The Prime Minister has spoken to the leader of Cornwall County Council and heard first-hand how local authorities are dealing with the situation. I visited the areas affected on Thursday to meet some of the people affected and to see how agencies responded. The council held a series of public meetings on Wednesday evening in Lostwithiel, St Blazey and Mevagissey to provide residents and councillors with the latest information and to offer support and advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/8">We have all seen on television just what an effect the flooding has had on homes, businesses and communities. It causes significant disruption, and we express our sympathy to all those affected and pay tribute to all who have been involved in responding to this emergency, in particular those who worked so hard throughout Wednesday. This shows what can be done by communities working together.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/9">The Government will continue to work with local authorities to help people rebuild their lives, although we know sadly that it takes time for homes and buildings to dry out. The Department for Communities and Local Government is ready to consider any application for Bellwin assistance from the local authorities affected. Once the damage has been assessed, CLG will be happy to discuss the best way forward with local councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/10">The insurance industry has a key role to play in assisting the recovery process. The Association of British Insurers has said that insurers' first priority will be to ensure that every claim is dealt with as quickly as possible and has put advice on its website for people who have been flooded by the heavy rain in Cornwall. At a recent flood summit on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-16">16 September</phrase>, government, insurers and other stakeholders agreed to continue to work in partnership towards 2013 when the current agreement between insurers and government expires.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/11">As a Government we are committed to ensure that flood and coastal erosion risk is managed effectively. We have started the implementation of the Flood and Water Management Act, providing for greater local leadership and partnership to address local flood risks. We are also protecting forecasting and warning services, and incident response, and prioritising the risk-based maintenance of existing defences. It is clear from the response that the lessons of Sir Michael Pitt's report on the summer 2007 floods are being learnt.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/12">Defra will be spending at least &#163;2.1 billion on flood and coastal erosion risk management over the next four years. We intend that, by March 2015, 145,000 households will be better protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/13">I want to assure Members that the Environment Agency and its local emergency partners, including the local authorities, are being extremely active and doing all they can to prevent flooding in areas currently at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/14">If people remain concerned about flooding they should visit the Environment Agency's website or telephone their Floodline on 0845 988 1188.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office (Francis Maude) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/2">Today we have released all government spend processed since the Government took office. This set of data are the key to so much that this Government want to achieve-driving value for money by forcing accountability for every penny spent, encouraging competition and innovation in providing services and driving economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/3">Starting from now, and updated every month, each government department will publish on <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk">www.data.gov.uk</a> every item of spending over &#163;25,000. Some departments are going even further by publishing everything over &#163;500. Each item will be listed in detail, with the date of transaction, the value, the name of the contractor and the description of the good or service purchased.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/4">It is our defining purpose to bring about a power shift in this country-to transfer to individuals and neighbourhoods control over public services so that people decide the things that really matter to them, such as the school they send their child to or the hospital they get treated in. Information is power, so transparency is a crucial part of this power shift. After all, it is information that lets people take on the political class, question it, demand answers and get those answers. It is information that lets people choose between different public services, increasing competition and raising standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government (Grant Shapps) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">I am today publishing a policy paper which sets out the Government's plans to reform the social housing system. These changes will provide greater freedoms for local authorities, make better use of resources, promote fairness, and ensure that support is focused on the most vulnerable people in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3">The case for reform is strong. Our social housing is an enormously valuable national asset, providing essential support for millions of families. However, the current social housing system is failing the people it was designed to help. There are nearly 1.8 million households on social housing waiting lists, many of whom have little chance of ever receiving a social tenancy. In far too many cases the allocation of a social home does not lead to independence and self-sufficiency, but appears instead to reduce incentives to work and to leave people trapped in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/4">Social landlords provide lifetime tenancies as the default option, so that households continue to occupy a social home and to pay low rents even if they no longer need this support. This cannot be right when so many other households in need are unable to access social housing. It is also not sensible that decisions on the types of tenancy to be awarded should be rigidly set at national level; these are decisions with local consequences and should be taken locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/5">Currently, people owed the main homelessness duty can effectively insist on being offered social housing, whether they need it or not, taking around a fifth of new social lettings. This significantly restricts the number of social homes that could be made available to others in need on the housing waiting list.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/6">We have already announced that-from April 2011-we will introduce a new affordable rent model for housing associations to offer to new tenants on a flexible tenancy and at a rent of up to 80 per cent of local market rents. I can now inform the House that I intend to introduce a new power for local authorities to offer fixed-term, flexible tenancies where they consider it is appropriate when letting social housing. This will be in addition to, rather than replacing, the power to grant life-time tenancies. With these new powers, and with a more flexible approach to regulation of both local authorities and housing associations, social landlords will be able to provide tenancies with a range of fixed periods that take account of the needs of individual tenants and the needs of the local community, and that enable the efficient management of their stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/7">These reforms will affect only new tenancies. I will ensure that the security and rights of existing social tenants continue to be protected and respected. Important rights for new flexible tenants will be protected in legislation, and through new provisions to regulate social landlords through a tenancy standard, on which we are seeking views.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/8">On succession rights, my intention is that all new secure and flexible tenancies will include a right to one succession for spouses and partners, but I will provide all social landlords with the flexibility to grant whatever additional succession rights they choose. No changes will be made to the succession rights of existing tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/9">Local authorities will regain the freedom to decide who should qualify to be considered for social housing and go on to their waiting list. Government will retain a role in determining who should have priority, to ensure that social housing continues to be available for those in greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/10">We will also make it easier for social landlords to help existing tenants previously trapped in unsuitable housing but unable to move because they lack sufficient priority within the allocations scheme. We propose to enable tenants who are not in housing need to transfer from one affordable home to another outside the allocations system. This should make it possible for more moves to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/11">Local authorities will also be able to discharge fully the main homelessness duty by arranging an offer of suitable accommodation in the private rented sector without requiring the applicant's agreement. We will provide protection: we will ensure that the private rented tenancies offered must be for a minimum fixed term of 12 months; and that, if the person becomes homeless again through no fault of their own within two years of accepting a private sector offer, the homelessness duty will apply again.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/12">My intention is to introduce the necessary legislation to deliver these reforms in the forthcoming Localism Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/13">The policy paper which I am issuing today provides details of these changes and sets them in the context of the wider reforms to social housing, which were announced in the spending review, to reform the way council housing is financed and to bring empty homes back into use as affordable housing, as well as our plans to provide for greater housing mobility and to change the way social housing is regulated. The paper makes clear that we are seeking views on the content of a tenancy standard, on the case for further reforms to social housing allocations, and on the need for further reforms to address overcrowding. We are also inviting local authorities and housing associations to comments on how they would expect to use the new freedoms and flexibilities. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.1/1">My honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Andrew Mitchell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/2">I wish to update the House on my visit to Sudan between 8 and <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-11">11 November 2010</phrase>. During my visit to Khartoum, El-Fasher and Juba, I met Vice-President Ali Osman Taha; President of the Government of Southern Sudan Salva Kiir; Presidential Adviser on Darfur Ghazi Salah Al-Din Al-Atabani; other government Ministers; a range of Sudan's political leaders; chairman of the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC) Professor Ibrahim Khalil; and members of civil society. I also met visiting UN Under-Secretary-Generals Baroness Amos and Alain Le Roy; UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) Special Representative Haile Menkerios; UN/African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) Joint Special Representative Ibrahim Gambari; members of the UN country team; humanitarian actors; and NGOs. In Juba, I opened the new HMG office, which will house staff from DfID, the FCO, the Stabilisation Unit and the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/3">In north and south Sudan, I stressed the importance of the referendum being credible, peaceful and on time. I delivered messages on the importance of both parties agreeing outstanding Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) issues such as Abyei, citizenship and the border. The UK is actively supporting the referendum, including through financial support to the UN Development Programme Basket Fund for the referendum process, which will provide voter education, civic education, practical assistance and technical support. We are also providing technical assistance to the talks on border demarcation and security arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/4">I made clear to the Governments in the north and south that the UK is committed to the longer-term future of both north and south Sudan, whatever the outcome of the referendum. Through successful completion and implementation of the CPA and progress towards peace and justice in Darfur, the north has an opportunity to change its political relationships with the international community. The Government of southern Sudan must set out a vision for the future with which its citizens can engage, including making appropriate investments to support diversification of the economy into non-oil activity. The UK has a substantial development programme in south Sudan, an area where thousands of adults are illiterate and women and children are more likely to die in childbirth than complete primary education. Amongst other benefits, this programme has already provided basic services for over 1.8 million people so far. We remain committed to supporting the long-term future of southern Sudan and to working with the Government to help improve the lives of those who live there.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/5">I found the situation in Darfur much changed since the Prime Minister and I visited in 2006, but in discussions with government Ministers and advisers, I underlined my concern about the security situation in parts of the three states. I called for the immediate and unconditional release of the four European nationals currently being held hostage (one Hungarian UNAMID peacekeeper and three Latvian World Food Programme pilots), and stressed the need for full and unhindered access for humanitarian workers and peacekeepers. I urged all sides to refrain from military escalation in Darfur and to engage constructively with AU/UN mediation to work towards an inclusive and sustainable peace agreement for Darfur. I reiterated the UK's support for the International Criminal Court and urged the Government of Sudan to engage with the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/6">I underlined to senior UN representatives that the international community could not be caught short in its preparedness to respond to a referendum-related humanitarian crisis in Sudan. I stressed the need for the UN and its agencies to have comprehensive contingency plans in place to address any potential future challenges.</p>

	Sudan: UN Security Council
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-11-22a.62.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100308" speakername="Lord Howell of Guildford" colon=":" colnum="62"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101122-wms0001.htm#1011222000057">
	<p pid="a.62.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (William Hague) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement: Sudan and the UN Special Session at the UN Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-16">16 November 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/2">I am pleased to update the House with regard to the UN Special Session on Sudan I chaired at the UN Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-16">16 November</phrase> in New York. The session was attended by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon; Head of the African Union High Level Implementation Panel, President Mbeki; Sudanese Foreign Minister, Ali Karti; Secretary-General of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, Pagan Amum; UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) Special Representative, Haile Menkerios; UN/African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) Joint Special Representative, Ibrahim Gambari; US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton; Austrian Minister for European and International Affairs, Dr. Michael Spindelegger; Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sven Alkalaj; and Nigerian Foreign Minister, Henry Odein Ajumogobia. Deputy Foreign Ministers from Brazil, Uganda and Japan also attended, as did permanent representatives from China, Russia, France, Lebanon, Gabon, Mexico and Turkey</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/3">As I made clear to the UN Security Council in my statement, this is a defining moment for Sudan and its people as they enter the final stages of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. It is a period of great risk and therefore a situation that the Security Council cannot ignore; but it is also a time of opportunity that the world cannot let go by. It is vital that the international community stands united and steadfast in its support of the CPA. That is why Sudan is the top priority for the UK's presidency of the Security Council this month and why I convened a special session of the council last week to discuss Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/4">I welcome the start of voter registration for the referendum on self determination for southern Sudan which began as scheduled on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-15">15 November</phrase>. This is the first of a series of essential steps. Early indications suggest that registration is proceeding in an orderly manner. We must all encourage timely and calm completion of this process. The process must be peaceful, credible and reflect the will of the people of southern Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/5">We must support the parties in their efforts to agree outstanding CPA issues, particularly on the status of Abyei. I am encouraged by political talks between the parties to address issues of fundamental and long-term importance to both north and south, including citizenship, security arrangements, natural resources, assets and liabilities and the north/south border. I welcome the strong leadership of President Mbeki in bringing the parties together, and welcome the work of the UN Special Representative Haile Menkerios.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/6">We must not lose sight of the situation in Darfur, where hundreds of thousands have suffered and died. We must work intensively with all parties involved towards a peaceful and inclusive political settlement, addressing the violence and insecurity, including by combating impunity, and supporting the peace talks in Doha. As I reiterated in New York, we strongly support the work of the International Criminal Court in Darfur and urge the Government of Sudan to comply with their obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1593.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/7">I strongly support the role of the UN/AU Mission in Darfur under the leadership of Joint Special Representative Ibrahim Gambari. Access for humanitarian workers and peacekeepers must be improved and kidnappings in Darfur must end.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/8">I welcome the role played by the Chief Mediator, Djbril Bassol&#233;, and the support of the Government of Qatar. I urge all parties to participate in peace talks to put a definitive end to the misery in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/9">A stable Sudan will help build security and prosperity in the region. It will mean that Sudan does not again become a base for terrorism or a source of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries. Most importantly, it will help the Sudanese people receive the tangible benefits of peace that have eluded them for so long. We must continue to strive to this end. I will be discussing Sudan at the Foreign Affairs Council today and will use the opportunity to stress the importance of finding solutions to the issues facing Sudan and supporting the parties in their efforts to bring a lasting peace to Sudan.</p>
