	Magistrates' Courts
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-07a.39.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="39"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51107-29.htm#51107-30_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.39.1/1">I am pleased to announce that today I have laid before this House a paper entitled <i>Supporting Magistrates' Courts to Provide Justice. </i>Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/2">Magistrates' courts play an essential role in the justice system. Each and every day they sit, the courts help to make our communities safer and more secure. They deal with over 95 per cent of all criminal cases. They respond quickly and effectively to childcare cases. And they help people resolve their disputes as fairly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/3">But the courts have not always received the support that they deserve and I wanted to know what we, the Government, can do to make magistrates' courts even more efficient and effective. This is why, last year, I launched the Supporting Magistrates to Provide Justice programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/4">The programme has looked at how the Government can help make improvements to the way magistrates' courts operate. To inform us, we asked the experts: magistrates, district judges, justices' clerks and other court staff. They responded in their thousands with a range of suggestions and ideas that I set out in a response paper that was laid before this House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/5">There were clearly areas where we could&mdash;and must&mdash;improve. This paper sets out where we have already taken action and where we will be taking forward further reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/6">It is focused on four main areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/7" class="indent">Helping to ensure magistrates are connected, to their communities. Magistrates must be able to keep abreast of the changing issues facing their evolving and increasingly diverse communities. We will support magistrates in understanding the current priorities and concerns faced by the local people they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/8" class="indent">Ensuring magistrates' courts are respected and valued, with court orders obeyed&mdash;courts are respected when the services and facilities they provide meet the needs of those who use and rely on the court, particularly victims and witnesses. This Government are committed to improving court facilities, providing efficient court processes and giving magistrates the authority to ensure their orders are obeyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/9" class="indent">Making sure the magistrates' courts are effective in dealing fairly and efficiently with the cases before them. Our courts have a very important role to play in the lives of every citizen. For the community to feel truly confident in the justice system and genuinely to respect the work of the magistrates' courts, it is critical that the courts deliver effective court services.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/10" class="indent">Improving the recruitment and retention of magistrates. The benefit of a volunteer magistracy is that they are able to represent the views of their community while providing a highly professional approach to discharging their responsibilities. In order that the magistracy is able to continue this critical role we propose a series of reforms and new initiatives which will see the development of a reinvigorated magistracy, attractive to the next generation of civic-minded citizens willing to commit a portion of their time to building safe and secure communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/11">This paper represents the next step in a continuous drive to provide the public with the service they expect from a modern magistrates' courts system.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/12">We will continue to look for further improvements so that our services are as efficient and effective as possible, making best use of the capacity of the courts and of the talent and expertise of those working in them.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/13">We are grateful to everyone who has contributed to the work that led to this paper.</p>
