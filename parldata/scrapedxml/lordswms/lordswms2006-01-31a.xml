<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-01-31a.9.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="9"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60131-33.htm#60131-33_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.9.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-19">19 January 2005</phrase> the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) announced that payments under the new CAP single payment scheme (SPS) were expected to commence in February 2006, well within the EU regulatory window of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">30 June 2006</phrase>. Over the past year, staff at the RPA have worked exceedingly hard to ensure that this expectation was turned into a reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/2">At the EFRA Select Committee hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-11">11 January</phrase>, I made clear that payments would begin, in line with the RPA's forecast, before the end of February and that an announcement would be made by the end of this month on whether they would be full or partial payments. Having considered the latest progress reports on the processing of farmers' claims I am pleased to confirm today that the RPA will now proceed to make full payments. The contingency system to make partial payments will not, therefore, be invoked.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/3">The RPA will now proceed to definitively establish entitlements on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase>, details of which will be communicated to individual farmers within two weeks of that date. This will allow for the trading of entitlements to commence in preparation for the 2006 scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/4">Where 2005 SPS applications have been fully validated, payments will start before the end of February, with the bulk being made in March. In the minority of cases where queries remain unresolved, the validation process will continue beyond March, but farmers may be assured that the RPA will make every effort to complete the task in the shortest possible time frame.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/5">I hope that this Statement will provide some reassurance to the farming industry about the progress of the scheme. I want to acknowledge the co-operation and patience of everyone who has made a claim.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.3/1">The judicial appointments annual report, covering the period <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, is published today, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>. This year the report continues to focus on developments and achievements within the judicial appointments process and the work undertaken ahead of the new Judicial Appointments Commission. We have placed the full statistical tables, which give the results of the various competitions held within the period of the report and their supporting narrative, on the departmental website at <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk">www.dca.gov.uk</a>. The report also shows that: 549 appointments were made during 2004&ndash;05 from around 3,500 applications; appointments, including lay appointments, of minority ethnic candidates accounted for 12 per cent of those made over the 18-month period; women accounted for 37 per cent of appointments; since <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, women have made up 46 per cent and minority ethnic groups 17 per cent of all appointments. The report also outlines improvements made to the judicial appointments process, including the introduction of competence-based selection for all judicial appointments and the pilots of assessment centre-based recruitment for recorder and employment tribunal appointments.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/2">Copies of the report will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses and is also available on the department's website (<a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk">www.dca.gov.uk</a>).</p>

	MoD: Pingat Jasa Malaysia Medal
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-01-31a.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="13"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60131-33.htm#60131-34_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.13.1/1">The Pingat Jasa Malaysia (PJM) is a commemorative medal which the Government of Malaysia would like to award to eligible British citizens, for their service in Malaya or Malaysia between <phrase class="date" code="1957-08-31">31 August 1957</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1966-08-12">12 August 1966</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">The Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals, the official committee which advises Her Majesty the Queen on matters of honours policy, has recommended that an exception to two of the long-established rules governing the accepting and wearing of foreign (including Commonwealth) awards be made, to enable the Malaysian Government to present the PJM. Her Majesty the Queen has been graciously pleased to approve this recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3">This exception to the rules means that all of the many thousands of eligible former members of the Armed Forces/veterans, and others, may receive the PJM. This will be in addition to the British General Service Medal, with appropriate Malaya/Borneo clasp, that many veterans will have been eligible to receive for their service in Malaya/Borneo.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">Permission to wear the PJM will not, however, formally be given. It is longstanding government policy that non-British medals will not be approved for events or service: that took place more than five years before initial consideration, or in connection with events that took place in the distant past (e.g. commemorative medals); and if the recipient has received a British award for the same service.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">However, Her Majesty's Government welcome, and believe it is important to recognise, the generous gesture by the King and Government of Malaysia, and their wish to acknowledge the service given by veterans and others in the years immediately after Malaysian independence. The exception recommended reflects this and our strong and important relationship with Malaysia.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/6">The Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals reviewed the five-year and double medalling rules, and considered that, while there were sound reasons why they should be retained, there will be occasions when specific circumstances require exceptions to the rules to be recommended. When such exceptions are contemplated, the committee will consider each request on a case-by-case basis, taking into account any special circumstances at the time. The fact that a similar request has been approved in the past will not mean that permission will be granted in future cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/7">Applications for the PJM, and its subsequent distribution will essentially be a matter for the Malaysian authorities, in collaboration with the relevant British government departments. Large numbers may be involved. It will take some time for the applications to be processed and for the medal to be distributed. The Malaysian High Commission and the relevant British government agencies will work together to determine eligible applicants. Veterans' organisations and service and regimental associations will also be involved.</p>
