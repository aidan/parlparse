	<p pid="a.79.3/2">The level of support for loans, grants and fees that will be available to eligible higher education students in the 2008-09 academic year will be 2.5 per cent higher than for 2007-08, in line with forecast price increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/3">For students who have entered higher education in or after <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-01">1 September 2006</phrase> and are being charged variable fees, the maximum fee payable will increase from &pound;3,070 to &pound;3,145 in 2008-09. The increase to the fee will be matched by a corresponding increase to the loan for fees that students can take out.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.3/4">For students who are not being charged variable fees (primarily students who entered higher education before <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-01">1 September 2006</phrase>), the maximum fee payable will increase from &pound;1,225 to &pound;1,255.</p>

The maximum amount of the disabled students allowance (DSA) for non-medical helpers will increase in 2008-09 to &pound;20,000 for full-time undergraduate students and to &pound;15,000 for part-time undergraduate students; the maximum amount of the DSA for postgraduate students will increase to &pound;10,000. All these rates are being incorporated into the Education (Student Support) (No. 2) Regulations 2007, which will be laid before Parliament in due course.</p>
