</major-heading>

	<p pid="a.29.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">Subject to parliamentary approval the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) will be taking a 2004&ndash;05 winter supplementary estimate. The effect this will have is to increase the NIO's DEL by &pound;29,789,000 from &pound;1,206,401,000 to &pound;1,236,190,000. Within the DEL change, the impact on resources and capital are as set out in the following table:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.29.1/5"> <td>Resources</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>Capital</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.29.1/6"> <td>Change</td> <td>New DEL</td> <td>Of which: voted</td> <td>Non-voted</td> <td>Change</td> <td>New DEL</td> <td>Of which: voted</td> <td>Non-voted</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.29.1/10">The change in the resource element of the DEL by &pound;3,981,000 arises from the draw down of &pound;3,996,000 end year flexibility and the surrender of a PES transfer of &pound;15,000 administration to security and intelligence agencies, to contribute towards administrative funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/11">The extra resource costs cover a range of areas within the department such as prisons, the Bloody Sunday inquiry, forensic science, central administration and the police service.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/12">The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from the draw down of &pound;25,808,000 end year flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/13">The extra capital costs cover a range of areas within the department such as central administration, criminal justice and prisons.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.1/2">The Government's consultation paper on broadcasting courts is published today, and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3">In the paper, the Government consider the question of broadcasting courts with an open mind. We are making no proposals to change the existing law&mdash;our purpose is to open the debate on this subject and to gauge stakeholder and public opinion prior to developing policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/4">Although no proposals are being made, throughout the paper the Government maintain the position that nothing must be done that would harm the process of justice in any way. In particular, no changes will be made that might place added pressure on vulnerable participants in court proceedings, such as victims and witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/5">In addition to the usual consultation with stakeholders, the Government wish to encourage responses to the paper from the general public. To this end, an electronic copy of the consultation paper will be available on the DCA website, alongside an interactive copy of the questionnaire which can be completed online. There will also be a discussion forum, accessible via a link from the DCA website, on which interested parties will be able to share their views.</p>

The impact on resource and capital is set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.3/24" class="indent">*Depreciation, which forms part of resource DEL, is excluded from the total DEL since the capital DEL includes capital spending and to include depreciation of those assets would lead to double counting.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/25">The change in the DEL arises from the take-up of end-year flexibility &pound;826,367,000 (&pound;7,014,000 administration costs) for capital, revenue and administration budgets as set out in table 6 of the Public Expenditure 2003-04 Provisional Outturn White Paper Cm 6293 published in July 2004. A transfer to the Department for Education and Skills of &pound;29,945,000 (&pound;15,000 administration costs) mainly for pay and pension indexation, contributions to the healthy schools programme and a project to widen access to healthcare professions. A net transfer to the Home Office of &pound;25,537,000 mainly for the substance misuse planning grant, offset by funding for prison healthcare and a contribution to the work of the national oversight group and drug action teams. A net transfer to the Scottish Executive of &pound;2,777,000 for out-of-area treatments and health publicity material, offset by a contribution for the high security infectious disease unit. A transfer to the National Assembly for Wales of &pound;11,160,000 for out-of-area treatments and health publicity material. A transfer from the Office for National Statistics of &pound;200,000 (&pound;195,000 administration costs) for a contribution to the data development work of the neighbourhood statistics programme. A transfer to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister of &pound;10,000 for older people's services.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/26">The administration cost limit has increased by &pound;7,194,000 from &pound;250,776,000 to &pound;257,970,000 as detailed above.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/27">The changes to the Food Standards Agency resource element of the departmental expenditure limit arise from a claim for end-year flexibility of &pound;12,803,000 (&pound;9,444,000 programme and &pound;3,359,000 administration costs) to fund ongoing FSA activity including a publicity campaign to raise salt awareness with consumers and the transfer of &pound;2,700,000 from the FSA to the Meat Hygiene Service, an executive agency of the FSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.3/28">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) administration cost limit has increased by &pound;3,359,000 from &pound;50,335,000 to &pound;53,694,000 as a result of incorporating administration cost EYF.</p>
