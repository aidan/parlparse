<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27b.139.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="139"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0001.htm#07112756000015">
	<p pid="b.139.1/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister (Mr Gordon Brown) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/2">The biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM) took place in Kampala, from 23 to <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-25">25 November</phrase>. Her Majesty the Queen attended the meeting in her role as head of the Commonwealth. This was Her Majesty the Queen's 18th CHOGM, and I&mdash;like my fellow Commonwealth leaders&mdash;pay tribute to her dedication and commitment to the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/3">The meeting came at a critical moment: in the midst of the democratic crisis in Pakistan; one week before the Bali climate change conference with only 10 to 15 years to turn the tide on global warming; half way to the millennium development goals which the world is in danger of not meeting; with months left to agree a global trade deal; and with no room for complacency in the fight against extremism.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/4">And as a unique partnership of rich and poor countries, the Commonwealth has a critical role to play in meeting these challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/5">Commonwealth leaders met in the aftermath of President Musharrafs decision on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-03">3 November</phrase> to declare a state of emergency. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">12 November</phrase> the Commonwealth Ministers' Action Group (CMAG) set out five conditions for Pakistan to fulfil in order to avoid suspension from the Commonwealth: lifting the state of emergency; the president giving up his job as chief of staff of the army; holding free and fair elections; releasing political detainees incarcerated during the emergency; and removing restrictions on the freedom of the press. Meeting in Kampala on the eve of CHOGM, CMAG concluded that whilst progress had been made&mdash;not least the commitment to an election that has been announced for <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-08">8 January</phrase>&mdash;the five conditions had not been met and, crucially, the state of emergency was still in place. Therefore Pakistan was suspended from the Councils of the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/6">The CHOGM and the UK made it clear that we hope to see Pakistan restored to the Commonwealth as soon as possible and will revisit the suspension in January once the election has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/7">The Commonwealth has sent the strongest signal that, above all, it stands for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/8">The meeting also agreed with the need to act collectively to:</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/9">redouble its efforts to deliver education for all, with a particular focus on enrolling the 30 million primary-school-aged children out of school across the Commonwealth; eliminating gender disparity in education; and strengthening education systems in countries affected by conflict. At Britain's initiative, heads also undertook to put in place, by the end of 2008, at least 20 long-term education plans of the type endorsed by the education for all fast-track initiative, and to focus on measuring and improving the quality of education;achieve a successful conclusion to the WTO's negotiations, in light of the fundamental contribution of international trade to global prosperity, sustainable development and to the elimination of poverty;establish a small group of Commonwealth heads to campaign for reform of international institutions, in order to achieve an architecture which reflects today's global challenges and is more effective and more representative;meet the millennium development goals&mdash;the responsibility of all countries rich and poor&mdash;and called for a UN meeting next year to re-energise global efforts; and,achieve a declaration on climate change, as we move towards the Bali summit, by calling for a long-term global goal for emissions reduction to which all countries must contribute&mdash;a comprehensive post-2012 global agreement that strengthens, broadens and deepens current arrangements and leads to reduced emissions of global greenhouse gases. We agreed on the need for all Commonwealth members to assess the implications of climate change for their societies, and offered new technical assistance through the Commonwealth to help achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/10">CHOGM also endorsed the analysis by the Commission on Respect and Understanding led by Nobel prize-winner Amartya Sen on how to promote respect and understanding among different ethnic and faith groups. The meeting recognised that all countries must work together to tackle the causes of radicalisation and noted that the diversity of its members gives the Commonwealth a unique perspective on these issues. Heads of Government committed to developing concrete activities to give practical effect to the Commission's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/11">We also applauded the work of Don McKinnon, outgoing Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, who has led the organisation with energy and creativity and welcomed his successor, Mr Sharma.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/12">I am confident that, following the Kampala CHOGM, the Commonwealth can continue to play a vital role in international affairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/13">Copies of the concluding communiqu&eacute; have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27b.140.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="140"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0001.htm#07112756000027">
	<p pid="b.140.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families (Kevin Brennan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/2">I am announcing today levels of funding to local authorities to support the implementation of ContactPoint and providing an update on the implementation timetable.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/3">Some &pound;40 million will be made available to support local implementation until March 2009, made up of the following elements:</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/4">&pound;27 million to local authorities in England, from April 2008 to March 2009, to support implementation;&pound;1 million from April 2008 to March 2009 to support national partners' ContactPoint implementation projects; anda further &pound;12 million from January 2008, made available to lead organisations to support modifications to case management systems. This will enable the main existing systems to provide data to ContactPoint and/or for authorised users to be able to have one-way access to ContactPoint via those systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/5">We have also provided indicative funding allocations to local authorities for future years: &pound;27 million in 2009-10 and &pound;15 million in 2010-11. My officials will write to local authorities and national partners today to inform local authorities and other partners about this funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/6">ContactPoint is a key element of the <I>Every Child Matters</I> programme to transform children's services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. ContactPoint will provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/7">ContactPoint will be a simple basic online tool containing:</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/8">minimal identifying information for each child; name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details for parents or carers. Each child will also have a unique identifying number;contact details for the child's educational setting and GP practice and for other practitioners or services working with them; andan indication as to whether a service or practitioner holds an assessment under the common assessment framework or whether they are a lead professional for that child.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/9">No case information will be held on ContactPoint.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/10">ContactPoint is being developed with extensive input from a wide range of stakeholders. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/11">delivery partners&mdash;local authorities and national partners (for example, voluntary and community sector organisations);practitioners and managers from across children's services, and bodies that represent them; andchildren, young people and parents and carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/12">Over the past few months we have been considering the substantial stakeholder feedback we have received and looked at the implications that the resulting proposed changes could have on the system. It is clear from the considerable work we have done so far that we will need more time than we originally planned to address the changes to ContactPoint which potential system users suggested.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/13">The change to the timetable will mean that deployment of ContactPoint to the &quot;Early Adopters&quot; local authorities and national partners will be in September or October 2008. It will be deployed to all other local authorities and national partners in 2009, between January and May, depending on final deployment slots. The additional time available presents a number of opportunities to do more work in the period prior to ContactPoint deployment, which will help to realise some benefits earlier. The fundamental design of ContactPoint will not change; the alterations will make sure the system works even more effectively for users and improves the ability of local authority ContactPoint teams to manage user access.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/14">The news on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase> of the loss of large volumes of child benefit data from HMRC has raised questions about the safety of large scale personal data in other Government systems, including ContactPoint. ContactPoint will not contain any financial information (such as bank details) or case information (such as case notes, assessments, medical records, exam results or subjective observations).</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/15">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>, the department conducted an assessment of how personal data are stored and protected in the department. As a result of that assessment, I am confident that we have very robust procedures in place. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">Wednesday 21 November</phrase>, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. To this end, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided to commission an independent assessment of its security procedures. This will be undertaken by Deloitte. Delaying the implementation of ContactPoint will enable the independent assessment of security procedures to take place as well as address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users have told us they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/16">Delivery partners will receive further information early in the new year. In the mean time, progress will be reported to local project managers regularly through their ContactPoint implementation co-ordinators. They will work with individual authorities and national partners to agree new deployment slots as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.143.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (David Hanson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/2">I am today announcing the publication of a consultation document to inform the strategic plan for reducing reoffending from 2008-11. The consultation period runs from today to <phrase class="date" code="">18 February 2008</phrase>, and the strategic plan will be published next spring. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office and on the internet at <a href="http://www.noms.justice.gov.uk/news-publications-events/publications/consultations/RRSP_2008-2011">www.noms.justice.gov.uk/news-publications- events/publications/consultations/RRSP_2008-2011</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/3">Reoffending causes real harm to individuals, to communities and to the economy. The costs of reoffending by ex-prisoners alone are significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/4">The Government have undertaken a successful programme of work to tackle reoffending since 1997. The latest results show that we have reduced proven adult reoffending by 5.8 per cent since 2000 against the predicted rate. Tackling reoffending is ongoing work and there is still more work to do to examine what other measures need to be in place to support offender management. The consultation paper seeks views from professionals working in the field on how the Government can capitalise on the successes to date, and continue to reduce reoffending rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/5"><I>Public Service Agreements (PSAs)</I></p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/6">From April 2008, a number of new public service agreement (PSA) targets will be introduced. The<I> Make Communities Safer PSA</I> includes a specific measure for reducing reoffending which focuses on the volume and seriousness of reoffending, thereby allowing us to monitor the success of our interventions with priority offender groups more closely, and reflect the impact that reducing reoffending has on overall crime rates. Other PSAs are also critical&mdash;specifically<I> Drugs and Alcohol</I>,<I> Socially Excluded Adults</I>, and<I> Young People: A Path to Success</I>. Each of these national agreements will act as levers to further embed the reducing reoffending agenda across government and at regional levels to support effective local delivery by partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/7"><I>Supporting Events</I></p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/8">The National Offender Management Service is today holding a national launch to promote the consultation. In recognition of that fact that co-operation between agencies is essential in successfully tackling reoffending alone, this event will also be used to launch the Department of Health's consultation<I>,</I><I></I><I>Improving Health; Supporting Justice</I> and a NOMS third sector action plan to build the contribution of the sector to work to reduce reoffending. Consultation events for partners in regions and Wales will follow in December and January.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27b.146.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100957" speakername="Lord Jones of Birmingham" colon=":" colnum="146"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0002.htm#07112756000068">
	<p pid="b.146.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Competitiveness, Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/2">In the fourth cohesion report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-30">30 May 2007</phrase>, the European Commission assesses the impact of cohesion policy at Community, national and regional levels in the European Union. The report also identifies a range of challenges that cohesion policy may be confronted with in the coming years and puts forward a set of questions for consultation. The consultation was formally launched at the Fourth Cohesion Forum in Brussels, held on the 27 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-28">28 September 2007</phrase>, which I attended and will close on <phrase class="date" code="">31 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/3">Cohesion policy is supported by actions at EU, national, regional and local levels. The consultation is not therefore solely about the structural and cohesion funds (SCFs) which have new objectives for the 2007-13 period.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/4">The SCFs are, however, a significant part of the EC budget, on which the Commission has recently published a communication &quot;Reforming the Budget, Changing Europe&quot;, also for public consultation, to prepare for the budget review in 2008-09. According to the communication, the Commission's approach is one of openness and with nothing ruled in and nothing ruled out: it will prepare this review with no preconceptions and encourages all interested parties to contribute to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/5">The Government are considering their approach both to the Commission's consultation on the future of cohesion policy and to the budget review process.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/6">In considering the cohesion report the Government will be looking at:</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/7">the aims of cohesion policy; and the most efficient mechanisms for achieving these aims.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/8">The Government's view on the EC budget is that it should be reformed so that the EU is better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Its approach is set out in the recent publication, <I>Global Europe: Meeting the Economic and Security Challenges, October 2007</I>. This identifies budgetary reform as one of the priority areas for EU action and sets out the three principles that will guide the Government's approach when considering how to achieve budgetary reform. Based on these principles, a priority for reform in the future will be &quot;a significant increase in the percentage of structural and cohesion funds (SCFs) spent on poorer member states&quot;. This is consistent with the policy direction set out in the Government's March 2003 publication, <I>A modern regional policy for the United Kingdom</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/9">The Government encourage interested parties in the UK to respond directly to the Commission on the cohesion report. We would also be interested in their views.</p>

	<p pid="b.147.1/1">I attended the EU Education Council to represent the UK on behalf of DCSF and DIUS.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/2">Ministers discussed the following issues:</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/3"><I>European Qualifications Framework</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Political Agreement</I></p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/4">The council agreed the European Parliament amendments to the EQF. These amendments were in line with the general approach that had been agreed previously at the Education Council, and there were no additional comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/5"><I>Improving the quality of teacher education</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Adoption of Conclusions</I></p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/6">The conclusions are intended to help countries to improve teaching standards and attract high-quality teachers into the profession. The UK was happy to support these conclusions, which were adopted without discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/7"><I>Education and Training as a Key Driver of the Lisbon Strategy</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Adoption of Resolution</I></p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/8">This resolution focuses on the role that education and training have to play within the Lisbon strategy, notably the role of education in the knowledge triangle, the links between education and training and other Lisbon policies, and the effective use of peer learning and the open method of co-ordination. The resolution was formally adopted with no discussion, and the Commission gave information on the joint report of the 2010 work programme, a draft of which it had accepted earlier in the week.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/9"><I>New Skills for New Jobs&mdash;Adoption of Resolution</I></p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/10">This resolution emphasises the importance of anticipating skills needs and providing opportunities for citizens to improve their skill levels to match these needs. I intervened to congratulate the presidency on this initiative, to reinforce the fact that skills have an enabling role and help Europe to compete in an increasingly globalised world, and to emphasise the importance of training those with low skills and those most at risk of social exclusion. The resolution was then adopted with no further comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/11"><I>Towards a More Multilingual Europe</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Exchange of Views</I></p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/12">Most Ministers welcomed this focus on multilingualism, stressing the important social and economic role it has to play within the EU. The main points raised during the discussion included the issues surrounding language training for migrants and the importance of looking beyond the EU to other important global languages. I intervened to acknowledge that the UK has not historically performed well in the teaching and learning of foreign languages, but that significant initiatives have been introduced in recent years. I stressed the importance of all languages, rather than just European languages, in fostering strong and cohesive multicultural communities. It would be a mistake to regard the languages used by long-settled communities as simply an &quot;immigration&quot; issue without regard to pride in historic cultural roots.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/13"><I>Erasmus Mundus Action Programme (2009-2013</I><I>)&mdash;</I><I> General Approach</I></p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/14">Ministers agreed a general approach on the new phase of the Erasmus Mundus programme, which will see an expansion of the programme to all levels of higher education, but particularly to doctoral studies, and provide additional financial support for EU students.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/15"><I>Resolution on Modernising Universities</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Exchange of views</I></p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/16">Ministers discussed this resolution, which addresses issues around autonomy, governance, curricula and mobility and will go to the Competitiveness Council (<phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November</phrase>) for formal adoption. I supported the joint approach linking mutually reinforcing areas of university and research policy, and stressed the importance of member states committing to university reforms, which are important for both economic reasons and for the life of universities. Other Ministers reported some progress in reform but were frank about how much more was needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/17"><I>Student mobility: broadening the social dimension of Erasmus</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Exchange of views</I></p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/18">This discussion saw a call from many Ministers for &quot;positive discrimination&quot; in the awarding of grants, to encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate. France stated that it would work on this during its presidency.

	<p pid="b.149.1/2">I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels. My right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Defence (Des Browne) and for International Development (Douglas Alexander) attended discussions of Defence and Development Ministers on 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>.</p>
