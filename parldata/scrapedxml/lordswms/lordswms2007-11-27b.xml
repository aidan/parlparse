<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-27b.143.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="143"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-wms0001.htm#07112756000044">
	<p pid="b.143.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (David Hanson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/2">I am today announcing the publication of a consultation document to inform the strategic plan for reducing reoffending from 2008-11. The consultation period runs from today to <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February 2008</phrase>, and the strategic plan will be published next spring. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office and on the internet at <a href="http://www.noms.justice.gov.uk/news-publications-events/publications/consultations/RRSP_2008-2011">www.noms.justice.gov.uk/news-publications- events/publications/consultations/RRSP_2008-2011</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/3">Reoffending causes real harm to individuals, to communities and to the economy. The costs of reoffending by ex-prisoners alone are significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/4">The Government have undertaken a successful programme of work to tackle reoffending since 1997. The latest results show that we have reduced proven adult reoffending by 5.8 per cent since 2000 against the predicted rate. Tackling reoffending is ongoing work and there is still more work to do to examine what other measures need to be in place to support offender management. The consultation paper seeks views from professionals working in the field on how the Government can capitalise on the successes to date, and continue to reduce reoffending rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/5"><I>Public Service Agreements (PSAs)</I></p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/6">From April 2008, a number of new public service agreement (PSA) targets will be introduced. The<I> Make Communities Safer PSA</I> includes a specific measure for reducing reoffending which focuses on the volume and seriousness of reoffending, thereby allowing us to monitor the success of our interventions with priority offender groups more closely, and reflect the impact that reducing reoffending has on overall crime rates. Other PSAs are also critical&mdash;specifically<I> Drugs and Alcohol</I>,<I> Socially Excluded Adults</I>, and<I> Young People: A Path to Success</I>. Each of these national agreements will act as levers to further embed the reducing reoffending agenda across government and at regional levels to support effective local delivery by partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/7"><I>Supporting Events</I></p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/8">The National Offender Management Service is today holding a national launch to promote the consultation. In recognition of that fact that co-operation between agencies is essential in successfully tackling reoffending alone, this event will also be used to launch the Department of Health's consultation<I>,</I><I></I><I>Improving Health; Supporting Justice</I> and a NOMS third sector action plan to build the contribution of the sector to work to reduce reoffending. Consultation events for partners in regions and Wales will follow in December and January.</p>
