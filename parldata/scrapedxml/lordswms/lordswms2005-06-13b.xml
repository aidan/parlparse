	Northern Ireland: Public Prosecution Service
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-06-13b.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050613/text/50613-14.htm#50613-15_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.47.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I are pleased to announce today the launch of the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/2">This new service was one of the main recommendations of the Criminal Justice Review, which was published in March 2000. The review itself stemmed from the Belfast agreement. The recommendations of the review were implemented by the Justice (Northern Ireland) Acts 2002 and 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/3">The public prosecution service will take responsibility for all prosecutions arising from a police investigation. It will provide an enhanced service for victims and witnesses, and encourage greater provision of prosecutorial and pre-charge advice to police. It will encourage the provision of prosecutorial and pre-charge advice to police to a greater degree. All charges will be reviewed by a public prosecutor before first appearance at court to ensure the case is properly brought. Prosecutions in the magistrates, youth and county courts will be carried out by public prosecutors. The new service will make use of the range of diversionary opportunities including informed warning, caution and youth conferencing as well as a range of restorative justice measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/4">The number of cases dealt with by the service will increase from approximately 10,000 cases per year to more than 70,000 cases because it will take over all prosecutions originally conducted by the police. This increased demand will be met by a considerable increase in the number of lawyers, support and administrative staff. The current workforce of 150 staff and 40 lawyers will increase to 550 staff with 165 lawyers. The new service will grow to become one of the larger employers in Northern Ireland and the largest employer of lawyers and legal staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/5">New staff will be subject to an intensive six-month training programme. It is a programme that ensures prosecution staff are not only knowledgeable in the law, but in the standards of fairness and of human rights that form the basis of any fair prosecuting authority. The training programme has already won a regional award in a national training awards UK competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/6">The new public prosecution service will operate an enhanced case management system. When the Causeway project goes online on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-21">21 June 2005</phrase>, it will enable the service to receive files electronically. These, and other changes, will promote efficiency and help reduce the causes of delay.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/7">The new prosecution service will also follow the recommendation of the Criminal Justice Review and be a regional service. It will have a devolved structure with regional prosecutors and five regional offices based in Ballymena, Lisburn, Londonderry, Newry and Omagh. This will not only allow for greater involvement with the community at a local level but will also create jobs in the regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/8">The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland is publishing a code of practice, which includes a code of ethics. These detailed documents will provide, for the first time in Northern Ireland, a detailed explanation of the factors and considerations taken into account in deciding on a prosecution and will set out the standards by which the prosecution will carry out its task. The code is the result of two periods of public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/9">A copy of the code will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
