	<p pid="c.45.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Don Touhig) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.1/2">In his Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-07">7 December 2004</phrase>, my predecessor announced our intention to appoint the first chaplains to the Armed Forces from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faith communities. These are the faiths, other than Christian, that are most represented in the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.1/3">Following a national recruitment campaign earlier this year, I am delighted to announce that chaplains from the Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faith communities have now been appointed. These chaplains will be employed as Ministry of Defence civil servants, but will be fully integrated members of the existing Service Chaplaincy organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.1/4">I am confident that their presence will contribute enormously to encouraging and promoting religious understanding and acceptance within the Armed Forces, and that they will provide comfort, support and valuable advice to individual service personnel who share their faith.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.1/5">Details of the new chaplains will be released both internally and externally once they take up their full formal duties following completion of a short period of induction and familiarisation training, during which they will learn about the Armed Forces and the work of the Service Chaplaincy organisation.</p>

	<p pid="c.45.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Culture (David Lammy) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.3/2">The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects, or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.3/3">In the six month period ended <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under Section 16 by the relevant departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued 970 undertakings, the Scottish Executive Education Department issued 186 undertakings and the National Assembly for Wales issued 159. This made a total of 1,315 undertakings given under Section 16. The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) issued a total number of 64 undertakings to non-nationals.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.3/4">The value of contingent liabilities in respect of undertakings given at any time under Section 16 and which remained outstanding as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are &pound;1,773,389,217.55.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.3/5">The value of Section 16 contingent liabilities as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> for the Scottish Executive Education Department are &pound;656,814,466.00 and &pound;80,350,537.00 for the National Assembly for Wales. The total value of contingent liabilities issued by MLA to non-nationals is &pound;978,419,161.00.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.3/6">The value of non-statutory undertakings given to Her Majesty in respect of loans from the Royal Collection and which remained outstanding as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> are &pound;133,424,160.00, &pound;32,494,000.00 for the Scottish Executive Education Department and &pound;4,720,000.00 for non-national museums issued by the MLA.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.3/7">The grand total value of loans out by national institutions and to non-national institutions as remained outstanding at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> is &pound;1,052,080,325.76.</p>

	<p pid="c.46.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.3/2">The Government have today given consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Npower Renewables Ltd's application to build 26 turbines with a capacity of up to 78MW, at Little Cheyne Court, near Dungeness.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.3/3">Following objections by the relevant local planning authorities, the Government held a public inquiry into the application and appointed Clive Richardson, an inspector from the Planning Inspectorate to preside over it. Mr Richardson recommended the application be granted.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.3/4">The decision to grant consent was taken after extensive and thorough consideration of the representations received, both for and against consent being granted. The extensive, independent public inquiry ensured that community and environmental concerns were heard.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.3/5">We are aware that this decision will come as a disappointment to those local people who opposed the application. Conversely, the decision will be welcomed by those local people who supported the application. Today's approval takes into account the concerns raised, and includes a number of conditions recommended by the inquiry inspector to mitigate any impacts.</p>
	<p pid="c.46.3/6">This wind farm will generate clean, renewable electricity and make a vital contribution towards reducing carbon emissions and meeting the UK's international obligations on tackling climate change.</p>

	Northern Ireland: Smoking Controls

	<p pid="c.48.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Shaun Woodward) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/2">This Statement sets out my intention to introduce comprehensive measures to protect all workers and the public from the dangers of passive smoking and second-hand smoke in workplaces and in all enclosed public places in Northern Ireland including all pubs and all bars.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June</phrase> I announced my intention to introduce partial controls throughout Northern Ireland on where people smoke. I also indicated that, over the coming months, I would decide whether to go further and extend controls on where people smoke in all workplaces.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/4">To help inform my decision I made fact-finding visits to Dublin and New York where controls had already been introduced to assess the benefits to public health and the impact of controls on businesses, especially the hospitality industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/5">The messages from both visits were similar. Both impressed upon me the improvements that have been made to the protection of public health for the general public and employees by controlling where people smoke.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/6">The department had already carried out a major consultation exercise between December 2004 and March 2005. This elicited 70,823 responses to questions about strengthening existing controls on tobacco use: 91.18 per cent of respondents expressed support for comprehensive controls similar to those already in place in the Republic of Ireland. These controls will also be introduced in Scotland next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/7">Trade Unions (with one exception) in Northern Ireland all supported the move to prohibit people from smoking in all workplaces and all enclosed public spaces. In addition organisations such as the Health and Social Services Boards, the BMA, local councils and the voluntary sector have made strong representations to the department for a complete ban on smoking in all public places and workplaces to protect public health.</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/8">There is strong cross-party support for a complete ban from the majority of MLAs (Alliance, DUP, the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists all registering their support).</p>
	<p pid="c.48.1/9">The proposals will be issued for consultation in the New Year.</p>

	<p pid="c.49.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions Reform (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/2">I am pleased to announce that on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-09">9 September 2005</phrase>, the Department for Work and Pensions published a consultation document containing draft Occupational Pensions Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/3">The draft regulations introduce a requirement that annual benefit information for non money-purchase benefits is provided automatically. This proposal was originally included in the June 2003 Command Paper <i>Simplicity, security and choice: Working and Saving for Retirement</i> (Cm 5835).</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/4">The draft regulations also establish a new approach to disclosure, replacing the rigid timescales of the current disclosure regime with a simple requirement that information be furnished within a reasonable period. These changes reflect recommendations made by Alan Pickering in his report, <i>A simpler way to better pensions</i> published in July 2002. The Pensions Regulator is also simultaneously consulting on a corresponding code of practice regarding views on what constitutes a reasonable period.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/5">These regulations will ensure that scheme members get important automatic information about their non-money purchase pensions, assisting them to make informed choices about the adequacy of their overall retirement provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.1/6">The consultation period is <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-09">9 September 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-02">2 December 2005</phrase>. A summary of responses, including the next steps, will be published by <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-17">17 February 2006</phrase>.</p>

	Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities

	<p pid="c.49.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/2">National Health Service spending is rising from &pound;33 billion in 1997-98 to over &pound;90 billion in 2007-08. This increased investment, together with reform and dedicated work by NHS staff, is transforming our hospitals, with reduced waiting times and lists, improved accident and emergency services and more up-to-date buildings and equipment.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/3">Ninety per cent of people's contact with the NHS is in primary care and the challenge now is to improve primary and community services. It is better for patients and taxpayers if long-term conditions like diabetes and heart disease and care for our ageing population&mdash;the big challenges facing the NHS in the 21st century&mdash;are dealt with in the local community, rather than in hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/4">The focus of services needs to shift more towards prevention, moving more services&mdash;like diagnostics, minor operations and other treatments&mdash;out of hospital wherever it is safe and effective to do so, and ensuring all communities get the services they need. We need to continue to reduce administrative costs, releasing further resources for frontline care.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/5">This needs stronger primary care trusts to design, plan and develop better services for patients, to work more closely with local government, and more effectively to hold hospitals and general practitioners (GPs) to account. GPs should also play a more effective role in developing better services for patients and be more accountable to their local communities for spending taxpayers' money. That is why the Government are rolling out &quot;practice-based commissioning&quot;, which will ensure that GPs help deliver better local services for patients. It will also deliver better value for money as GPs help patients avoid going into hospital unnecessarily, and spend the money they save on improving community services, including preventative measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/6">To take this agenda forward in a planned way, with manageable timescales, <i>Commissioning a Patient-led NHS</i> was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>. Its purpose was to streamline strategic health authorities, strengthen primary care trusts and engage GPs with practice-based commissioning&mdash;all in the cause of improving services to patients. Rather than impose change from the centre, we asked SHAs to submit local proposals for consultation to the department by <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-15">15 October</phrase>. We asked them to work with local people and stakeholders, including honourable and right honourable Members. The proposals have now been received, and are being analysed against the criteria set out by the NHS Chief Executive (Sir Nigel Crisp) on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/7" class="indent">securing high-quality, safe services for patients;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/8" class="indent">improving health and reducing inequalities;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/9" class="indent">improving the engagement of GPs;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/10" class="indent">improving public involvement;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/11" class="indent">improving co-ordination with social services through greater &quot;co-terminosity&quot; of PCT and local government boundaries; and</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/12" class="indent">effective use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August</phrase>, the department sent a letter to all SHA chief executives stressing that proposals should consider the context of local health needs, and that different solutions from different SHAs would be encouraged, as long as they were justifiable against the above criteria. He also stressed the need to engage local stakeholders and partner organisations from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/14">An external panel representing key interests has been established to advise Ministers on whether the proposals meet the criteria. The panel is chaired by Michael O'Higgins, managing partner and member of the international board of PA Consulting Group. Members include:</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/15" class="indent">Jane Barrie, Chair of the SHA Chairs;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/16" class="indent">Peter Mount, Chair, NHS Confederation;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/17" class="indent">Joan Saddler, Chair, Waltham Forest PCT;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/18" class="indent">Harry Cayton, national director for patients and the public, Department of Health;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/19" class="indent">David Colin-Thome, national director for primary care, Department of Health;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/20" class="indent">Jennifer Dixon, Director of Policy, King's Fund;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/21" class="indent">Liz Fradd, Chief Executive, Nurse Directors' Association;</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/22" class="indent">Ara Darzi, Imperial College; and</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/23" class="indent">David Henshaw, Chief Executive, Liverpool City Council.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/24">After this consideration, any proposals for changes to PCT boundaries will then go out for a three month statutory consultation to all local stakeholders and staff interests. This consultation will begin in early December 2005. No decisions on future local configurations will be taken until after this full statutory local consultation has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="c.49.3/25">Changes to SHAs will precede changes to PCTs and any changes to the latter will not commence before April 2006. Any changes to PCTs' role in providing services will take place over a longer timescale and will be subject to consultation in the usual way. Any such changes will build on the results of the forthcoming White Paper on community health and social care services, based on the current listening exercise, <i>Your Health,</i> <i>Your Care, Your Say. </i>Staff will be fully involved in deciding new arrangements and identifying which services will be best for patients. Any staff transferring to a new employer will, of course, be entitled to appropriate legal protection of their terms and conditions of employment. The social partnership forum has decided to set up a working group led by NHS employers to fully engage all trade unions in all workforce issues arising from the commissioning of a patient-led NHS change programme.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-10-18c.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="51"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo051018/text/51018-39.htm#51018-39_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.51.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Alistair Darling) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/2"><i>The Future of Rail</i> White Paper (Command Paper 6233), published in July 2004, announced our intention to consider how rail passenger franchises could be best aligned with Network Rail's regional and route structure.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-19">19 October 2004</phrase> I announced that, following expiry of the current Central Trains franchise, the existing services would be distributed among other train operators in the region. This change is designed to improve the efficiency and performance of the railways, achieving savings through economies of scale and improving service to customers. Since then, much work has been done, in consultation with the rail industry, to determine the most appropriate way of achieving these objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/4">I am today announcing the new structure of rail franchises which will be implemented. The structure incorporates market-based groups of services with an operational focus, which are better aligned to Network Rail's routes in order to encourage joint working between track and train. Three new franchises will replace four existing franchises.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/5">East Midlands will operate services to and from London St Pancras together with regional and local services in the East Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/6">West Midlands will operate the West Coast Main Line outer suburban services to and from London Euston (currently operated by Silverlink County) together with regional and local services in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/7">A new cross-country franchise will be created. The existing franchise, operated by Virgin Rail Group under temporary arrangements with DfT Rail, will now be re-let in autumn 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/8">The expiry dates of the current Central Trains and Silverlink franchises will be extended to autumn 2007. This allows time for the development of detailed specifications for the new franchises and for full competitive procurement to take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/9">There will be an option to transfer the Liverpool to Nottingham service to the TransPennine Express franchise if this demonstrates better value for money. There will also be an option to transfer the services to and from Birmingham Snow Hill to Chiltern Railways, if this, too, can demonstrate better value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/10">Detailed discussions are taking place regarding the possible transfer to Transport for London of the London inner-suburban services operated by Silverlink Metro.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/11">I shall keep the House informed of further developments as we continue to implement the proposals set out in the White Paper.</p>
