	Afghanistan: London Conference
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-02-13a.49.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="49"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60213-19.htm#60213-19_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.49.1/1">I wish to inform the House that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, his Excellency Hamid Karzai, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan opened the London Conference on Afghanistan on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>. My right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Jack Straw), the Secretary of State for Defence (Dr John Reid), the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Hilary Benn) and my honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr Kim Howells) represented the UK at different sessions. The conference was attended by over 60 delegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">The London conference successfully created the framework for the next phase of development in Afghanistan. It demonstrated the commitment of the Afghan Government and the international community to deepen their partnership, as we work together to build a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Afghanistan. The launch of the Afghanistan compact (a copy of which I have placed in the Library), and discussion of the interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy and of the revised National Drug Control Strategy, all contributed to a renewed sense of purpose and direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/3">Many delegations made new financial pledges at the conference, making available over $10.5 billion for the implementation of Afghan Government priorities over the next five years. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister told the conference that for its part the UK would spend &pound;500 million in assistance for Afghanistan over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/4">The conference recognised the interconnected nature of the challenges ahead, with progress on security, governance and development being mutually reinforcing. It recognised the cross-cutting nature and scale of the narcotics problem and the threat that this posed to Afghanistan's reconstruction. Delegates welcomed the newly updated National Drugs Control Strategy. On security issues, it was noted that Afghanistan continues to welcome assistance from international forces and supports the expansion of the NATO-led ISAF. On governance, there was broad support for sensitive handling of transitional justice issues and acknowledgement of the valuable role played by NGOs in Afghanistan's reconstruction. The conference welcomed the Afghan Government's plans for economic and social development by focusing on private sector development, investment in key infrastructural sectors such as power, water and roads, and by building human capacity. There was also useful discussion about improving aid effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/5">I am pleased that representatives of the Afghan National Assembly and of Afghanistan's civil society were able to attend the conference. Our partnership is both with the Government and the people of Afghanistan and their elected representatives. The challenge now is to build on the momentum created by the conference&mdash;to implement the compact so as to bring real improvements to the lives of people in Afghanistan. Early follow-up action will include establishing the new joint co-ordination and monitoring mechanism envisaged in the compact, to achieve greater coherence of effort between the Afghan Government and the international community, led for the latter by the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/6">I will set out the detail of UK support for the newly updated National Drug Control Strategy in a separate Written Ministerial Statement tomorrow.</p>

	Elections: Pilot Schemes
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-02-13a.50.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="50"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60213-19.htm#60213-20_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.50.1/1">The Government are continuing to look at ways to modernise our electoral system and to increase the opportunities that people have to vote. To test the effectiveness and robustness of these innovations and to build public confidence in them, we are continuing to conduct a programme of pilots in 2006 which maintains the momentum that was started in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/2">With this aim in mind, at the end of October 2005, in conjunction with the Electoral Commission, we issued a prospectus inviting expressions of interest from local authorities seeking to run electoral pilots at the May 2006 local elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/3">Today I am pleased to announce that I have accepted 16 applications from local authorities to hold pilots at the May 2006 local elections. The names of the successful local authorities are attached at the end of this Statement. A background paper providing further details on the pilots has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">The local authorities will pilot innovations including:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/5" class="indent">trials of changes to the administration of elections proposed in the Electoral Administration Bill, such as changes to the ballot paper to support more secure efficient production of postal votes and the checking of signatures on postal ballots;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/6" class="indent">voting in alternative locations such as shopping centres and rural locations to allow us to further test how voting in different locations and at different times can enhance access; and</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/7" class="indent">electronic counting of ballots which will build on past work and test how this can be refined to ensure confidence and support future use of technology to gain efficiencies in the administration of elections. This will also enable us to identify how technology can support counting in the different voting systems used in local authority and regional elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/8">Some of these pilots will assist us in planning the implementation of the proposals in the Electoral Administration Bill, in ensuring the ongoing integrity of electoral mechanisms and in refining and developing the programme of work for ensuring electoral processes fit with the needs of modern lifestyles.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/9">The next step will be for us, working in consultation with the Electoral Commission and the local authorities, to draw up the statutory orders authorising the pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/10">We are grateful to all local authorities that applied to pilot in May 2006 and are keen to continue to engage local authorities in looking at innovative ways to improve the elections process and take advantage of new technologies.</p>

	House of Lords: Broadcasting
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-02-13a.53.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100067" speakername="Lord Brabazon of Tara" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60213-19.htm#60213-20_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.53.1/1">The Information Committee has recently made two changes to the arrangements for broadcasting in the House. These changes originate from the report <i>Members Only? Parliament in the Public Eye</i> by the Hansard Society Commission chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2" class="italic">Filming in the Chamber</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">Monday 13 February</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">Thursday 16 March</phrase> a trial will be held of a new protocol governing filming in the Chamber. The new protocol relaxes the rules and conventions that govern what the broadcasters can film when the House is sitting. The purpose of the new protocol is to enable broadcasters to provide more engaging footage of the business in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/4">The new protocol is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/5" class="indent">The director filming the proceedings in the House of Lords Chamber should be free to select such shots as he believes appropriate in providing coverage of the business of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/6" class="indent">These should include a greater variety of shots than used at present (including close ups, panning shots etc); and the freedom to select reaction shots beyond simply named or identified Peers in order to provide &quot;tone&quot; of coverage which reflects the mood of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/7" class="indent">During Divisions the broadcasters should continue to receive a locked-off wide shot of the Chamber. Viewers will be able to hear some sound but this will just be a general &quot;hubbub&quot; and microphones will not be able to pick up specific conversations.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/8" class="indent">Shots unrelated to the business of the House will not be allowed (incidents of disorder; the public gallery; Peers &quot;in the news&quot; etc) and the camera team will be expected to maintain complete neutrality with regard to the competing demands of different broadcasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/9" class="indent">In order to discourage disorder, such incidents as may occur would be covered within the current disruption procedures for the Commons and Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/10" class="italic">Television interviews</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/11">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">Monday 13 February</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 25 July</phrase> a trial will be held of a television interview point for broadcasters in the House of Lords. The point will be in the north-east corner of Peers Lobby, and the backdrop will be looking across the Lobby towards Brass Gates.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/12">Initially, broadcasters will only be able to record interviews from this point and not broadcast live. The BBC funded the provision of the facility in Central Lobby and, like the independent broadcasters, has expressed a clear interest in establishing a Lords interview point. However, no broadcaster has, at this stage, indicated any desire to fund a &quot;live&quot; technical link to their studios.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/13">The trial will enable an assessment of the level of genuine interest among broadcast companies for such a facility. It will also allow the Information Committee to make an informed decision about whether a live interview point should be installed.</p>
