	China: GB-China Centre
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-05-24b.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="51"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060524/text/60524-44.htm#60524-44_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.51.1/1">I am pleased to announce the Government's continued support for the Great Britain-China Centre (GBCC) through a grant-in-aid by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office after a recent review.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/2">The GBCC has been a centre of expertise on China, with a particular focus on human rights, labour reform and improving the rule of law in China, since 1974. It can contribute unique skills and access to fulfilling these important functions. The centre also provides support for parliamentary and other exchanges with China. The GBCC is a non-departmental public body (NDPB) sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office through an annual grant-in-aid of &pound;300,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/3">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office commissioned a review of the GBCC in mid-2005. The aim of the review was to examine whether the function provided by the GBCC was required, and whether the centre's existing form as a NDPB was the best option for delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/4">During the consultation period following the review, many honourable Members expressed their views to the Government on the valuable role of the GBCC in promoting sensitive issues such as labour reform and the rule of law in China. It was judged that the arm's-length approach of the GBCC brings value-added benefit that cannot be achieved by Government. In light of these responses and subsequent work by the GBCC and officials of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to correct the management and control weaknesses identified in the review, the Government have decided to maintain the GBCC's NDPB status.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/5">The follow-up work to the review has ensured that the GBCC now has stronger financial controls, a better alignment of the centre's work with government policy on China and improved management oversight. Ministerial agreement to these new measures brings to an end the process initiated by the review. The GBCC now looks forward to further consolidating and expanding its position as a centre of expertise on China, widening its project base and diversifying its funding sources, including from the EU, UN and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/6">Throughout this period, we have appreciated the constructive and co-operative approach of all members of the executive committee and staff of the GBCC. The Government welcome the conclusion of the review and look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the GBCC on China.</p>

	Legal Services Bill
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="b.52.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-17">17 October 2005</phrase>, I informed this House of the publication of <i>The Future of Legal Services: Putting Consumers First</i> White Paper setting out the Government's proposals for the regulatory reform of legal services in England and Wales. I am pleased today, just seven months later, to be publishing the draft Legal Services Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny, as the first step in delivering on those proposals. Copies of the draft Bill and accompanying regulatory impact assessment will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/3">The draft Bill sets out our detailed plans for the creation of a strong independent oversight regulator, the Legal Services Board, which will ensure that front-line regulators discharge their duties effectively. In addition, legislation will provide the LSB with a wide range of powers including those to authorise and de-authorise front line regulators and quickly to bring unregulated legal services under its remit through secondary legislation to best protect consumers' interests. Our proposals also provide for the creation of an independent Office for Legal Complaints, which for the first time will remove the handling of legal complaints from the legal professions. The OLC will help to foster greater consumer confidence and result in quick and fair redress.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/4">The draft Legal Services Bill also sets out arrangements to facilitate alternative business structures, which would enable different kinds of lawyers, and lawyers and non-lawyers, to work together on an equal footing. These structures will allow legal services to be delivered in new ways, promoting greater competition and innovation and enabling providers better to respond to the demands of consumers. A range of safeguards will be put in place to protect consumers and demand high standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/5">In taking forward these proposals the Government have continued to engage with key stakeholders. The Consumer Advisory Panel, comprising representatives of main consumer bodies, has contributed significantly to informing and shaping the proposed reforms. In addition to the consumer panel we have, throughout the process, maintained effective engagement with all stakeholder groups including the legal professions, consumer organisations and the general public.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/6">The draft Legal Services Bill will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee that has been constituted for that purpose, which will report by July 2006. This timeframe provides an opportunity for Parliament to take evidence and consider the detail of the proposals and make recommendations through the Joint Committee's final report.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/7">These proposals are complex and important and I believe that it is right that Parliament should have the opportunity to scrutinise them in draft form. I look forward to receiving the Joint Committee's report.</p>

	Roads: M6 Toll
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-05-24b.53.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060524/text/60524-45.htm#60524-45_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.53.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/2">The M6 toll road was privately financed, built, and is now operated by Midland Expressway Ltd (MEL) under a concession agreement signed by the then Secretary of State for Transport in 1992.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/3">Having borne all the financial and development risk associated with the construction of the &pound;900 million M6 toll, Macquarie Infrastructure Group (MIG)&mdash;the owners of MEL&mdash;is proposing to refinance MEL's debt, recognising the revised risk MEL now bears as operator of the road, which has been open to traffic since December 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/4">I am pleased to record that MIG has agreed to fund &pound;112 million of road improvements in the West Midlands from its total refinancing resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/5">This reinvestment will fund improvements to the slip road access from the M42 to the southern end of the M6 toll, and will cover the costs of construction, operation and maintenance of a new road from the M54 and Telford to the M6 and the M6 toll.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/6">The need for this link was identified in the West Midlands Area Multi-Modal Study (WMAMMS), to improve access to and from the M54 corridor and Telford, and the Highways Agency has been undertaking detailed work with a view to developing a scheme for entry to the targeted programme of improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/7">The new road should open to traffic around 2012 (subject to the usual statutory processes), helping to free up current bottlenecks and to improve road travel through the region.</p>
