	G8 Global Partnership

	<p pid="a.95.1/1">Members will wish to be aware of the publication on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase> of the second annual report by the Government of the United Kingdom's contribution to the global partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction. The second report details the progress made in the past 12 months in destroying and securing the former Soviet Union's legacies of WMD and associated materials and infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/2">The UK pledged 750 million dollars to the Global Partnership at the Kananaskis G8 Summit in 2002. Since then the FCO, DTI, and MoD in close co-operation with the Russian Federation, other countries of the former Soviet Union, central and eastern Europe and other funding partners, have developed a wide portfolio of programmes and made considerable progress on implementing projects on the ground which help to tackle these issues. In 2005, the UK in its capacity as G8 president intends to take forward the work of the global partnership under the theme of &quot;Pledges to Progress&quot;, focusing on effective project implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/3">The international community faces immense challenges in tackling the legacy of cold war weapons of mass destruction left in the former Soviet Union. The cold war WMD programmes in the FSU have created a significant non-proliferation and environmental threat to us all. This work represents the UK's largest non-proliferation programme and, as the report indicates, we have made significant progress over the last 12 months in collaboration both with other donor nations and our partners in the FSU.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/4">Copies of the report are available in the Library of the House. Further reports will be published annually setting out the progress achieved in the work being undertaken by the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.5/1">I have today published <i>Delivering Diversity in Public Appointments 2004, </i>which explains what each central government department is doing to increase diversity on the boards of their public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/2">The report contains action plans for each department as well as details of progress to date. It also includes targets to increase the proportion of appointments held by women, people from minority ethnic backgrounds and disabled people to be achieved by 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/3">The Government are keen to ensure that their commitments to public appointments are met. The first is that selection should be made on merit, using fair and open procedures that ensure the best available candidate is appointed to each post.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/4">The second is a commitment to improving diversity in public appointments. There is real value in boards broadly reflecting the community they serve and I firmly believe that more diverse boards lead to more effective decision-making.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/5">Overall progress has been made in the representation of people from minority ethnic backgrounds and disabled people. However, the overall figures for women have dropped slightly, thus emphasising the need to continue to promote our diversity objectives and continue our outreach work.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/6">The report can be found on the Internet at <a href="http://www.publicappointments.gov.uk">www.publicappointments.gov.uk</a>. Copies of the report have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
