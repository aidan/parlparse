	<p pid="a.10.1/1">My right honourable friend, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/2">The House will recall that on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-29">29 April 2008</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) announced the deployment of the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles (2 Rifles) to Kosovo during June as part of our existing commitment to the NATO/EU shared pan-Balkans Operational Reserve Force (ORF).</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/3">During this period, the security situation in Kosovo has remained calm. There were no significant incidents of interethnic unrest, and a number of key political dates passed peacefully. In particular, the implementation of a new constitution represented an historic moment in Kosovo's progress towards establishing itself as a stable, democratic and multiethnic state.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/4">Against this background, NATO has now assessed that its Kosovo force has the capability to maintain a safe and secure environment without further recourse to the ORF. As a result, I am pleased to announce that 2 Rifles completed its mission on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase> and is in the process of returning to UK. The UK will, however, remain committed to the NATO/EU pan-Balkans ORF until the end of this year, at a lower readiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/5">The deployment of the UK ORF battalion confirmed yet again the professionalism of our Armed Forces and demonstrated our commitment to the security of Kosovo during a politically sensitive period.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.1/1">My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Derek Twigg) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/2">I am pleased to inform the House that the department is releasing the final report of the mild traumatic brain injury project team established by the Surgeon General in June 2007. A copy will also be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/3">I previously informed the House of the conclusions of the project team in my Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-15">15 January 2008</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-01-15.23"><I>Official Report</I>, cols. 23-24WS</phrase>). Release of the final report provides further rationale and explanation of the key conclusions that:</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/4">there is no evidence that mTBI is having an adverse effect on operational capability within the UK Armed Forces;the majority of cases of mTBI become symptom-free within two to three weeks and 80 per cent are symptom-free within three months; and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) has identified 585 cases of casualties between February 2003 and November 2007 with traumatic brain injury (whether mild, moderate or severe) out of some 36,000 referrals to deployed UK operational emergency departments. This represents 1.6 per cent of all medical presentations during the period, and 0.5 per cent of the deployed UK military population.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/5">The report also provides further detail of the actions we have already taken to address mBTI, including the rollout of a diagnostic and surveillance tool to deployed theatres, and the establishment of a treatment protocol covering information for deployed service personnel, telephone-based support for patients, and outpatient and inpatient treatment at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Headley Court which becomes the DMS lead centre for mTBI, re-enforced by ongoing epidemiological and research findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/6">The report also describes current research in mTBI relevant to the military environment under way at DSTL, South Tees NHS Trust emergency department, and King's College London.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/7">Finally, the report and associated historical review and literature review documents&mdash;will be placed in the Library of the House. They provide a sense of perspective, explaining that mTBI is almost certainly not a new phenomenon, and that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions between organic and psychological effects in the case of brain injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/8">As I explained in my previous Statement, research continues both here and in the US. Throughout our research, we are in touch with United States developments, and collaborate with its researchers as appropriate. I shall keep the House informed of any further significant developments.</p>
