	European Court of Human Rights: B and L v United Kingdom
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-21a.107.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="107"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51121-47.htm#51121-48_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.107.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-13">13 September 2005</phrase> judgment was given in the case of <i>B and L</i> v <i>United Kingdom</i>. This case concerned an application before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg challenging the Marriage Act 1949 prohibition on the marriage of parents-in-law to children-in-law. It was held that the prohibition was in violation of Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/2">The Government have accepted this judgment and intend to implement it by amending the Marriage Act 1949 by way of a remedial order. Subject to parliamentary approval, this amendment, when in force, will allow marriages between parents and children-in-law. The Government will lay a document containing a draft remedial order and the other information required by the Human Rights Act 1998 before Parliament shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/3">The parallel provisions in the Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Schedule 1, Paragraphs 3 and 9; Schedule 27, Paragraph 13 and 17 (in part)) will not be commenced so that same-sex couples that wish to form a civil partnership will have parity of treatment in this regard.</p>

	Inspectorate for Justice, Community Safety and Custody
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-21a.111.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="111"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51121-47.htm#51121-48_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.111.1/1">Today the Government will publish a policy statement announcing their intention to create a single inspectorate for justice, community safety and custody. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/2">The Government are committed to creating an independent and robust inspection regime for the justice system. In March a consultation exercise was launched that sought views on the purpose, function and future structure of inspection in this sector. The consultation period ended in June and after careful consideration of views the Government believe the best way to realise that ambition is to create a single inspectorate for justice, community safety and custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/3">The policy statement outlines proposals for the design of the new inspectorate. Building on the excellent work done by the five existing inspectorates for the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, court administration, prisons and probation, the new inspectorate will be a modern organisation that provides a strong, expert and independent public voice and gives authoritative assurance and constructive criticism on how the system is working for the people who rely on it: victims, witnesses, defendants, jurors, convicted offenders, professionals and the wider public as its ultimate funder and beneficiary.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/4">The new inspectorate will have a general duty to inspect and report on the functioning of the justice system and the delivery by the bodies within it of their duties relating to wider community safety. Inspection of and reporting on the treatment and conditions of those in prison and other specified forms of custody will be a special duty of the inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/5">The Government look forward to working with those concerned with the future of the justice system to implement a unified and strongly led inspectorate that is forward-looking and focused on improving services so as to reduce crime and re-offending and promote confidence in the system as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.1/1">In a Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">Thursday 10 February 2005</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>WS 46</i>) it was announced that the previous annual Cabinet Office publication <i>Public Bodies </i>had been replaced by an online searchable database. I am pleased to announce that the 2005 update of the database has now been completed. Data on individual public bodies as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> were made available online during the summer, and the package has now been completed with the provision of summary reports and a printable (pdf) file of all the 2005 data. The database is accessible at <a href="http://www.knowledgenetwork.gov.uk/ndpb/ndpb.nsf">www.knowledgenetwork.gov.uk/ndpb/ndpb.nsf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2">The database lists the public bodies sponsored by central government, with contact details, information about their remit and about the membership of their boards. The figures are broken down between male and female members for individual bodies, and summaries are provided at departmental level for the proportions of board members who are women, have declared they have a disability or come from a minority ethnic background.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">Comparisons with 2004 database returns show that diversity levels have remained broadly similar. There has been a small increase in the proportion of appointees who have declared they have a disability, but a slight decrease in the percentage of appointments held by women and by people from minority ethnic backgrounds. This reinforces the Government's commitment to continue to pursue their diversity objectives and to promote outreach activity and plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/4">The database also includes information about the Government's task forces, ad-hoc advisory groups and reviews, giving a more complete picture of the bodies and groups working to deliver the Government's objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/5">Copies of a printed version of the pdf file are available in the Library.</p>
