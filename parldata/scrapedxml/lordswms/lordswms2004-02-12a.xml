	Rent Service
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-02-12a.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="51"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040212/text/40212-29.htm#40212-29_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.51.1/1">Responsibility for the Rent Service, an executive agency, is to transfer from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The transfer will take place with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/2">The reasons for transferring the Rent Service (TRS) to the Department for Work and Pensions are that the vast majority of TRS's work (around 90 per cent) is on rental valuations to determine how much housing benefit (HB) claimants should receive. Although this is carried out primarily for local authorities, the policy and legislative lead rests with DWP. TRS, which will retain its executive agency status on transfer, will be better placed to assist with taking forward the ongoing work on housing benefit reform&mdash;announced by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in October 2002&mdash;if it is operating within DWP.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/3">Only a small percentage of TRS's current workload relates to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's responsibilities on fair rents. The transfer will not prevent the agency contributing to the ODPM's policy objectives, as the role and functions of TRS remain the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is consulting with the trade unions involved in this change of departmental responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.1/1">Following consultation with the Electoral Commission and other key stakeholders the following instruments have now been made and laid before Parliament: The Local Elections (Principal Areas) (Amendment) (England and Wales) Rules 2004, SI No. 223 The Local Election (Parishes and Communities) (Amendment) (England and Wales) Rules 2004, SI No. 224 The Greater London Authority Elections (Amendment) Rules 2004, SI No. 227</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also laid before Parliament, following consultation, the following draft instruments on which we are seeking the approval of the House: The Local Elections (Ordinary Day of Election 2004) Order 2004 The European Parliamentary Elections Regulations 2004 The Representation of the People (Combination of Polls) (England and Wales) Regulations 2004 The Local Authorities (Conduct of Referendums) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 The Local Authorities (Mayoral Elections) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2004</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">As a package of measures these instruments would: give effect to the Government's announced intention to move the date of the English local authority and Greater London Authority elections in 2004, so that they take place at the same time as the European Parliamentary elections, and make consequential amendments relating to: the term of office of councillors affected by the postponement; the six-month period during which by-elections need not be held; the date of annual meetings for authorities affected by the postponement. make provision for the conduct of European Parliamentary elections in Great Britain and Gibraltar; provide revised rules for the combination of polls at all elections and also referendums pursuant to the Local Government Act 2000; and provide for other amendments to the Greater London Authority election rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/4">A summary of the responses we received during consultation on the draft instruments has been made available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	Elected Regional Assemblies: Planning Applications

	<p pid="a.54.1/1">The regional governance White Paper, <i>Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions</i> published in May 2002 announced that elected regional assemblies would, &quot;have the power to request the Secretary of State to call in for his or her determination strategic planning applications which were not consistent with the regional spatial strategy&quot; (paragraph 4.34).</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister proposes to strengthen these arrangements so that they have the same effect as those in London. We propose to give elected assemblies a power to direct local planning authorities to refuse strategic planning applications on similar grounds to those in London. The Mayor of London can exercise this power where he or she considers it would be, &quot;contrary to the SDS [sustainable development scheme] or prejudice its implementation, or otherwise be contrary to good strategic planning in London&quot;. (paragraph 6.12 of Government Office for London Circular 1/2000).</p>
