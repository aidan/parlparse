	Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000: Renewal of Temporary Provisions
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-02-12a.51.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="51"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040212/text/40212-29.htm#40212-29_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.51.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-21">21 September 2003</phrase>, I announced a review of the effectiveness of the temporary provisions of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. Principally these relate to 50:50 recruitment. That review was initiated as part of the Secretary of State's statutory duty, under Section 47 of that Act, both to have regard to progress made towards securing that membership of the police and police support staff is representative of the community in Northern Ireland, and to consult the Policing Board, when making a decision as to whether those temporary provisions should be renewed. The review ended on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase>, but I have continued to meet with political parties on this issue until recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/3">As a direct result of these temporary provisions, steady progress towards a more representative police service has been achieved. The number of Catholic applications to the PSNI has been unprecedented, averaging 35 per cent over six competitions. As a direct result, the proportion of Catholic officers in the regulars has increased from around 8 per cent to almost 14 per cent. Increase in Catholic representation among civilian staff has been slower, in part because 50:50 does not apply to all civilian recruitment competitions, only to those where six or more are sought in the same field at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/4">A number of issues were raised during the review about the efficiency of the 50:50 recruitment process and its fairness to candidates. I am looking seriously at those issues and my officials are liaising with the police to assess the scope for potential improvements. The Government are keen to move forward with increasing the representativeness of the police service. The more progress we can make now, the sooner it may be possible to put an end to a procedure that is difficult for many people to accept, but justified in our view for the greater good.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/5">For these reasons, and after considering carefully all the views expressed during the consultation period, the Secretary of State has now decided that those temporary provisions should be renewed for a further three years. That is why I am today laying before Parliament the draft Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (Renewal of Temporary Provisions) Order 2004. There will be an opportunity to debate the order in both Houses of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.1/1">Responsibility for the Rent Service, an executive agency, is to transfer from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The transfer will take place with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/2">The reasons for transferring the Rent Service (TRS) to the Department for Work and Pensions are that the vast majority of TRS's work (around 90 per cent) is on rental valuations to determine how much housing benefit (HB) claimants should receive. Although this is carried out primarily for local authorities, the policy and legislative lead rests with DWP. TRS, which will retain its executive agency status on transfer, will be better placed to assist with taking forward the ongoing work on housing benefit reform&mdash;announced by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in October 2002&mdash;if it is operating within DWP.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/3">Only a small percentage of TRS's current workload relates to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's responsibilities on fair rents. The transfer will not prevent the agency contributing to the ODPM's policy objectives, as the role and functions of TRS remain the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is consulting with the trade unions involved in this change of departmental responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.1/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister proposes to strengthen these arrangements so that they have the same effect as those in London. We propose to give elected assemblies a power to direct local planning authorities to refuse strategic planning applications on similar grounds to those in London. The Mayor of London can exercise this power where he or she considers it would be, &quot;contrary to the SDS [sustainable development scheme] or prejudice its implementation, or otherwise be contrary to good strategic planning in London&quot;.

	<p pid="a.54.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State (Ms Rosie Winterton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/2">We shall lay before the House regulations to increase National Health Service charges in England from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. There will be a cash increase in the prescription charge of 10 pence from &pound;6.30 to &pound;6.40 for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/3">The cost of prescription prepayment certificates will rise to &pound;33.40 for a four-month certificate and &pound;91.80 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for those needing more than five items in four months or 14 in one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/4">Prescription charges are expected to raise some &pound;462 million for the NHS in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/5">Charges for elastic stockings and tights, wigs and fabric supports supplied through the hospital service will be increased similarly.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/6">The maximum patient charge for a single course of dental treatment begun on or after <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> will increase from &pound;372 to &pound;378.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/7">The prescription charge increase is the same as in the previous five years and is well below the current level of inflation. The other increases are in line with this percentage increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/8">The majority of optical voucher values will increase by 2.5 per cent to help children and people on low income with the cost of spectacles or contact lenses. In recognition of the greater costs which people with high prescription lenses may face, vouchers for these individuals will increase by 10 per cent. We will continue to monitor the costs of high prescription lenses over the coming year to see if further changes are necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/9">NHS charges and optical voucher values in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are a matter for the devolved administrations.</p>

	David Bennett Inquiry
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-02-12a.55.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="55"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040212/text/40212-30.htm#40212-30_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.55.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State (Ms Rosie Winterton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/2">The report of the independent inquiry into the death of David &quot;Rocky&quot; Bennett is published today. David Bennett's death is a tragedy and my sincere sympathies go out to his family for their loss. He died five years ago in a medium secure unit after being restrained by staff. The report raises a number of very important issues. We have a duty to understand these and act upon their findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/3">It is essential that the health service is safe for service users and staff. Following a meeting with David Bennett's family, we established the cross-government group on the management of aggression and violence. We have just published positive practice standards for local services, and have established a programme of work with the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) to help to improve the organisation and quality of training for staff. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence will shortly publish guidance in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/4">I accept that there is discrimination in the NHS, both direct and indirect. There is no place for racism or discrimination. It is unacceptable; it contradicts the basic value of equity that is the cornerstone of the health service. In mental health we have already made a start by publishing <i>Delivering race equality</i>, which outlines a national framework for local action.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/5">Behaviours and processes that have grown up in mental health services mean that there is particular inequity in the provision of care and outcomes for people from black and minority ethnic groups. We are committed to rooting out racism, tackling these inequalities and ensuring that the experience of people from black and ethnic minority groups is improved. The consultation feedback on <i>Delivering race equality </i>and the recommendations of the David Bennett inquiry report will help to inform future action.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/6">We also need senior, committed, leadership to ensure that change happens. This is why Professor Kamlesh Patel, chair of the Mental Health Act Commission, has been asked to direct the national programme of work, including the work of the National Institute for Mental Health. A national steering group, co-chaired by Lord Victor Adebowale, from Turning Point will also inform us. I will expect quarterly reports on progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/7">The National Institute for Mental Health has been set up to help to improve local mental health services. Its largest programme is focused on black and minority ethnic mental health. It covers: better quality and more intelligently used information; more appropriate and responsive services; and, increased community engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/8">In order to ensure that change is sustainable we need to work with local communities to help us to understand their needs and to build their confidence. To help to achieve this we will fund 80 community engagement projects and appoint 500 community development workers to make a direct connection between local people, staff and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/9">In <i>Delivering race equality </i>we are absolutely committed to ensuring that staff have the knowledge and skills to enable them to deliver services to, and in partnership with, all groups in their community. This includes race equality training.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/10">Last but not least, when serious incidents occur, we know that good communication is essential. Families and carers need to be involved, and different agencies must communicate more effectively with each other. We are therefore working with the Home Office and police to improve local liaison; and with the NPSA to reform the process of independent inquiries. This will help to ensure that families and carers can be more closely engaged, and that staff and services learn the lessons they need to. We deeply regret the death of David Bennett. We are committed to making change happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.1/2">I stated in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January</phrase> that I was commissioning a report to examine the gateways into the professions. I am pleased to announce the appointment of Sir Alan Langlands, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dundee, to lead this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/3">Sir Alan will act as an independent person to oversee the report, which will examine how the public sector and the professions can sustain and improve recruitment opportunities for graduates, especially those who do not qualify for the full &pound;3,000 support, and to make recommendations to Ministers on action that can be taken by the employing organisations to provide clear accessible gateways for all graduates who want to pursue such careers and which will benefit the recruitment needs of these sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/4">The report will cover mainly the public sector but will also look at good practice in the private sector and will include those who work in a professional capacity in the voluntary sector. Additionally there will be reference groups established, one for each sector and with voluntary sector representation on each group.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/5">On the public sector, the report will analyse support that is currently available, (through bursaries, golden hellos, fee payment and loan write-offs), its effectiveness and future plans for post-autumn 2006. Furthermore it will assess whether these (plus any changes) are likely to continue to work after autumn 2006; and whether there are any gaps in what is available which are likely to create recruitment and retention problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/6">On the private sector, it will research current and possibly international practice on incentives for graduates, and assess how employers might respond in a variable fees environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/7">I am asking Sir Alan to start this work after Royal Assent this year with the aim of reporting to me by mid-2005.</p>

The projects in wave 1 are: the four BSF pathfinder projects, which were announced last March: Bradford, Bristol, Greenwich-Lewisham-Southwark (joint project), and Sheffield; plus 10 further projects. These are: Knowsley, Leeds, Manchester (phase 1 of their proposal only), Newcastle, Newham, Solihull, Gateshead/South Tyneside (joint project), Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, and Waltham Forest; and two reserve projects: Lancashire (Burnley) and Leicester City.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.3/5">That is a total of 16 projects involving 19 local education authorities (LEAs) and substantial investment in some 180 schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.3/6">BSF must get off to a flying start, to ensure that the considerable benefits that this programme promises are delivered: greater impact on educational standards and local deprivation, improved procurement, and better value for money. Our focus on delivery will be enhanced through the creation of a new agent to support delivery&mdash;Partnerships for Schools. The department will manage Partnerships for Schools jointly with Partnerships UK, and with the participation of 4ps (Public Private Partnerships Programme), to co-ordinate the national delivery of the programme and provide support for LEAs. This body aims to build on the many strengths of the LEAs, and will respond to their needs, with a view to complementing rather than duplicating their role.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.3/7">At the national level, Partnerships for Schools will: support the Government in selecting areas to receive investment; establish best practice in delivery, both nationally and locally; and develop innovative and effective models of procurement, which help to create long-term public/private partnerships (PPPs), reduce the burden of bid costs, and streamline procurement through standard documentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.3/8">We are also publishing today a compendium of exemplar designs of the schools of the future. The designs are examples of high-quality school design by 11 leading architectural firms who have created some of the country's best modern buildings. The designs will help LEAs and schools to develop their educational vision and requirements, and will drive consistently high standards across all LEAs. They are not a straightjacket, but an inspiring basis for thinking about future provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.3/9">The resulting designs are innovative and inspirational. The compendium contains the aims of the programme, detail of the designs themselves, as well as some of the common emerging themes across the designs. The designs balance the need to design schools for today&mdash;for example, incorporating concepts from extended schools and special needs&mdash;with innovative ideas for tomorrow, such as the potential teaching models of ICT-rich open learning spaces in all-through schools or schools-within-schools.</p>
