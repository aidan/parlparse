	<p pid="b.120.3/2">Following news reports in recent weeks, I made a Statement about the coal health compensation schemes to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase> outlining a number of immediate steps I was taking to respond to these issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.120.3/4">The draft terms of reference are:</p>
	<p pid="b.120.3/5" class="indent">&quot;To review the integrity of the administration of the scheme for dealing with coal health claims; and to identify any specific measures needed to improve the administration of the scheme; to consider whether there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent, detect and pursue fraud while ensuring the fair and timely settlement of claims; and to make recommendations accordingly to Ministers and/or the accounting officer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.3/6" class="indent">Candidates to lead the review are currently being approached and we hope that the lead of the review will be announced shortly. The precise timing and conduct of the review would be a matter for further discussion with the head of the review, but we would expect that conclusions should be available by the end of September.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.3/7" class="indent">The review will not encroach on the ongoing investigations being carried out by the South Yorkshire Police into potential fraud under the compensation schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/2">The Ministry of Defence has been reviewing how best to organise elements of our supply chain in order to provide the Armed Forces with the necessary logistic support in a modern environment. I am today able to announce the outcome of a number of studies into logistic support arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/3">The future defence supply chain initiative aims to deliver a modern and effective defence supply chain focused on meeting the demands of today's Armed Forces both in peacetime and in support of operations. MoD has been evaluating four alternatives and has selected an in-house option worked up in close consultation with the trades unions to provide the best possible combination of effectiveness and cost. By updating processes, improving training for staff, rationalising the distribution network and the closure of the storage depots at Stafford by the end of 2007, Llangennech by mid-2008, and Longtown by mid-2009 we expect to make savings of over &pound;50 million per year by 2010 and over &pound;400 million over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/4">The new organisation will require around 2,000 fewer civilian posts and around 50 fewer Armed Forces personnel. These reductions will contribute to the wider MoD manpower reductions announced in the 2004 White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/5">A study into the future role of the defence munitions centre at Crombie in Dunfermline West is now complete and I have decided, subject to consultation with the national trades unions, to implement the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/6">The study determined that the explosives storage capacity available at DMC Crombie is not required to meet the known and projected storage liability of its customers. Crombie will, in future, concentrate on providing a loading/off-loading function to HM ships and royal fleet auxiliaries, together with berthing and other jetty operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/7">DMC Crombie currently employs 168 staff. If the recommendations of the study are implemented, there would be a reduction of 142 posts at the site. It is anticipated that 67 posts would go in the first year, with the balance of 75 posts being phased over years 2006&ndash;07 to 2009&ndash;10. Implementation of the study recommendations has the potential to deliver savings in the order of &pound;18.1 million over a 10-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/8">I have also today approved, subject to conclusion of trade union consultation, ABRO's proposal, to begin phase one of a two-part rationalisation programme. Phase one addresses the immediate impact of the downturn in ABRO's defence revenue projections, but will not diminish the range of capabilities ABRO is currently able to deliver to the front line.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/9">As a result, ABRO will reduce its headcount to approximately 2,150 posts by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, which includes the potential for up to 246 redundancies. The changes will realise annual manpower cost savings in the region of &pound;2.1 million in 2005&ndash;06, and &pound;8.3 million per year thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/10">ABRO is still developing phase two of the programme but the aim is to address the process efficiencies, site restructuring and other change initiatives required to ensure ABRO has a sustainable competitive position from which it can grow in the medium term.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/11">Finally, as a direct consequence of an announcement made today by Rolls-Royce Defence Aerospace on the outcome of an open competition for future overhaul and component repair on RB 199 engine modules, up to 50 jobs will be lost at the Defence Aviation Repair Agency's (DARA) engines business unit at Fleetlands in Gosport, Hampshire. I have agreed that DARA can now begin the formal 30-day consultation process with the trades unions.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/12">We are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact on the people affected by these announcements. Our current plans envisage that the majority of civilian reductions will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early release but some compulsory redundancies may prove necessary. There will be no redundancies from the Armed Forces. Staff and the trade unions are being kept fully informed of developments through meetings, briefings and formal consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/2">In the Statement I made to this House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-22">22 July 2004</phrase>, I said that I would report further material developments in the move towards digital switchover. I am pleased to say that good progress continues to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/3">By the end of March 2005, digital television was being enjoyed by over 62 per cent of the UK households.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/4">A growing number of retailers and manufacturers, as well as other parts of the industry, are using the digital switchover logo and committing to give reliable information to consumers. Over 250 retail organisations (representing over 2,300 retail outlets, covering both nationwide chains and small independent stores), 20 manufacturers (covering most major brands) and seven manufacturers of aerials and/or coaxial cables had registered to use the logo by June 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/5">A not-for-profit company, Switchco, has been set up by the public service broadcasters and the digital terrestrial television multiplex operators, with the support of manufacturers, and retailers, to co-ordinate the technical roll out of digital terrestrial television across the UK, region by region, to a timetable agreed by Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/6">While the Government will continue to inform the public of the benefits of digital switchover, Switchco will lead a major communication campaign to educate the public and ensure everyone knows what is happening, what they need to do, and when. They will also liaise with TV manufacturers, retailers, aerial installers, digital platform operators and consumer groups to ensure the switchover programme is properly implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/7">The new digital replacement licences for the commercial public service broadcasters (ITV, Channel 4, Five and Teletext) require the extension of the digital terrestrial network so that digital coverage can reach the same level as analogue. By this means we should be confident that the 98.5 per cent of households who today are able to receive all the nationally available analogue public services will be able to receive the digital equivalents of these services. We are also considering with OFCOM how people who cannot receive analogue television could receive digital television through satellite, cable, ADSL or another emerging technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/8">We are publishing today the report of the digital switchover technical trial in Ferryside and Llansteffan and the associated research on vulnerable households. This trial investigated the technical issues for broadcasters and consumers associated with the switch from analogue to digital terrestrial television transmission. It has received overwhelming support from the community involved which was the first one to undergo the switchover process.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/9">We acknowledge that landlords who own or manage communal TV systems need to start taking steps to prepare for digital switchover. In association with the Chartered Institute of Housing, we are developing comprehensive new guidance for private and social sector landlords who have properties with analogue communal systems which need to be upgraded. The guidance will be published during the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/10">As stated in our manifesto, we are committed to achieving digital switchover between 2008 and 2012 ensuring universal access to high-quality, free-to-view and subscription digital TV.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/11">However, we need to ensure that the interests of elderly people and other vulnerable groups are protected. We know there will be some people who need assistance to understand, install and use digital television equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/12">We will be running a pilot in Bolton this autumn. This will help us to understand how best to provide this assistance whether it is by using leaflets, dedicated phone lines, support from social workers and charities or installation by professional engineers.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/13">We are now close to the point where we will have the information which we require to confirm the region by region timetable for switchover. I expect to make a further announcement this autumn, and will report further progress to the House as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/14">Copies of the report have been placed in the House Libraries and are available at <a href="http://www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk">www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	EU Education Ministers: Informal Meeting
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-21b.124.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="124"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050721/text/50721-17.htm#50721-17_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.124.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education (Bill Rammell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/2">On 12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-07-13">13 July</phrase>, my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Ruth Kelly) chaired an informal meeting in London of education Ministers from the EU, accession, candidate and EEA countries to look at how skills can contribute to raising productivity and therefore to the Lisbon goals for jobs and growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/3">The meeting consisted of four sessions, which considered:</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/4">Sector skills</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/5" class="indent">My right honourable friend (Ms Kelly) outlined our presidency focus on highlighting how education and skills can contribute to the Lisbon agenda and the importance of skills responding to the needs of employers. Ministers discussed national experiences in developing sector-based approaches as a mechanism for employers to express skills requirements and to link education and training with labour market requirements in a knowledge economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/6" class="indent">There was consensus that employers should be involved in both designing and delivering vocational training courses, but only a few Member States involved employers in academic education. Ministers agreed that vocational training should be made more attractive to learners.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/7">European Qualifications Framework</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/8" class="indent">This session was focused on a presentation by Commissioner Figel of the European Commission's consultation on a proposed European Qualifications Framework. This would provide a tool for improved understanding of qualifications from different countries. This should help mobility of learners and workers and thereby alleviate skills gaps. The Commission consultation is planned to last until the end of the year. The idea was welcomed by Ministers, but they underlined that it should be user-friendly and must be implemented on a voluntary basis. Commissioner Figel explained that the Commission would propose a Council and Parliament recommendation next spring.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/9">The Relationship of Skills to Productivity</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/10" class="indent">The presidency tabled a paper, prepared by the four UK government skills alliance departments and agreed jointly with the European Commission. This sets out evidence for the contribution of skills to increasing productivity. It also raises questions for ministerial discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/11" class="indent">Ministers discussed skills in a panel session with representatives from industry. John Monks, General Secretary ETUC, explained that unions could be ambassadors for learning. He pointed out that employees were often nervous about undertaking training, as they were worried about failing. Philippe de Buck, Secretary General of the EU-wide employers' organisation, UNICE, argued that governments needed to provide more support for training in companies particularly for SMEs. Bill Thomas, a member of the UK's ICT sector skills council, underlined the importance of business people understanding how ICT could be used to improve productivity.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/12" class="indent">Ministers agreed that economies would increasingly need highly skilled people, but also underlined the importance of having good basic skills as a foundation for achieving this.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/13">Possible Next Steps</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/14" class="indent">The meeting concluded with ministerial discussion groups. I chaired one group, with other groups chaired by Phil Hope MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Skills, and Allan Wilson MSP, Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.3/15" class="indent">During these groups, Ministers agreed that: skills needs should be addressed at a sectoral and regional level; better recognition of informal and non-formal learning was needed; and that businesses should be encouraged to invest more in training their employees. There was an interest in member states continuing to share experiences and learn from each other on sector-based approaches. There was also recognition that education Ministers should explore ways of working across government, with other Ministers with an interest in skills and productivity, and that education Ministers should be closely involved drawing up Lisbon national action plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.1/7">The Council adopted an opinion on an updated stability programme presented by Portugal for the period 2005&ndash;09.</p>

	EU Presidency: Informal Competitiveness Council
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-21b.127.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="127"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050721/text/50721-18.htm#50721-18_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.127.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/2">The Informal Competitiveness Council hosted by the UK presidency took place in Cardiff on 11&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July 2005</phrase>. Lord Sainsbury of Turville chaired the first day covering research issues and I chaired the second day, which considered EU Better Regulation and the development of the internal market. Over dinner on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July</phrase> both research and economics/industry Ministers discussed innovation policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/3">On the first day, research Ministers heard presentations from a number of speakers, including Research Commissioner Potocnik and representatives from industry and science.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/4">The Commission stressed the need for the EU to help fulfil Lisbon goals for growth and jobs by committing more money for EU research, both nationally and for the EU's next research framework programme (FP7). Speakers from academia and business presented on how the framework programme could be made simpler and more accessible for business and how the Scientific Council for the proposed European Research Council (ERC) had been chosen.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/5">Ministers then broke up into five small groups for detailed discussions on: the structure of the European Research Council (ERC); increasing industry and SME participation in the framework programme; and how to develop the potential of the less-research-intensive regions. In addition, Ministers were asked to consider the cross-cutting issue of simplification as it related to their areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/6">Group rapporteurs reported vigorous and useful discussions. Lord Sainsbury concluded that while there were still difficult issues to tackle, there was consensus on the need for the ERC to be independent; on the need for effective, practical help for SMEs; that collaborative research should be more user-driven; that help for less research intensive regions had to be focused; and on the continued importance and need for simplification.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/7">On the second day, the session on EU better regulation opened with presentations from the vice-president of the European Commission and Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry Gunter Verheugen, Alain Perroy (Director General of CEFIC&mdash;the European Confederation for the Chemicals Industry&mdash;and leading member of the Alliance for a Competitive European Industry) and Jacek Piechota (Polish Economics Minister).</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/8">The Commission's commitment to progressing the better regulation agenda in the EU and the importance of regulatory reform in achieving Lisbon objectives on growth and jobs were stressed. The Commission also outlined recent initiatives that would contribute to the delivery of regulatory reform, including strengthened impact assessment guidelines that would ensure effects of proposed legislation on competitiveness were taken into account, a new push to simplify existing EU regulation and screening of proposals that were already on the table for their effects on competitiveness. Alain Perroy gave a business perspective on the need for regulatory reform and Jacek Piechota outlined steps that Poland had taken at a national level to improve policy-making processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/9">Ministers then split into four groups to discuss using impact assessments in Council deliberations; maximising the involvement of business in policy-making; simplification; and what member states can do to improve the regulatory framework at a national level. Ministers reported productive and positive discussions, with a strong consensus on the need to deliver regulatory reform for growth and jobs. In my summary, I welcomed the Commission's clear commitment to change and recent initiatives, and emphasised the need for the Commission and member states to work together to achieve results.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/10">Debate on the internal market began with presentations from Czech Deputy Prime Minister for economic affairs Martin Jahn, who explained how membership of the internal market has benefited the Czech economy, and Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, who called for greater efforts to ensure effective implementation of the existing <i>acquis</i> and for progress on opening up the market in services.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.1/11">Subsequent breakout group discussions concluded that the internal market was often taken for granted and should be more vigorously promoted. The perception of enlargement (focused on immigration and social dumping) was at odds with the actual impact (a strengthened global position for the EU, a more varied and flexible EU economy). Ministers also emphasised the need for progress on the services directive as key to the future development of the internal market. In addition, implementation, enforcement and the provision of advice and assistance to businesses and citizens were seen as crucial.</p>

	<p pid="b.129.1/5" class="indent">The Foreign Secretary gave a brief presentation on the GAERC work programme for the next six months, highlighting in particular future financing and the future of Europe. On future financing, the Foreign Secretary highlighted the president's commitment to work towards a deal during the presidency. On the future of Europe, the Foreign Secretary welcomed Luxembourg's referendum result, and said that the next step should be on the basis of the declaration agreed at the June 2005 European Council. We are committed to having a broad, inclusive debate during the period of reflection. The informal heads of government meeting this autumn was a key next step.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.1/6">Enlargement</p>
	<p pid="b.129.1/7" class="indent">The Foreign Secretary briefed partners on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July</phrase> meeting of the Croatia Task Force where there was further consideration of Croatian co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). There was no change in its assessment that Croatia was not yet co-operating fully with the tribunal. The Foreign Secretary invited the task force to review the situation in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.1/8" class="indent">Commissioner Rehn presented the Commission's draft negotiating mandate for Turkey. He highlighted that Turkey's progress would be long and difficult. The council's reasons for opening talks and its previous commitments remained unchanged. The opening of negotiations on <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase> was conditional on six pieces of legislation entering into force (they all had on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June</phrase>) and on Turkey signing the Ankara agreement protocol.

	<p pid="b.129.1/9">World Trade Organisation (WTO)</p>
	<p pid="b.129.1/10" class="indent">Commissioner Mandelson updated the Council on the mini-ministerial in Dalian (12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-07-13">13 July</phrase>) and gave an assessment of how preparations are going in the run up to the end of July WTO General Council in Geneva. The Foreign Secretary noted that the main trade discussion would take place during the informal trade ministers' dinner on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-18">18 July</phrase>. The Council agreed conclusions, which recalled that Council conclusions from October 1999 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-28">28 June 2003</phrase> in particular remain valid and set the Community approach to the Doha development agenda (DDA) negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.1/11">Preparation of the EU-China Summit</p>
	<p pid="b.129.1/12" class="indent">The Foreign Secretary updated partners on the progress of preparation for the <phrase class="date" code="">5 September</phrase> summit. A progress report on summit preparations covering the draft agenda, elements for a Joint Statement and Declaration on Climate Change and Energy was agreed. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner highlighted that the Commission would also be signing the financing agreement for two environmental projects totalling &euro;55 million. The Commission also raised China market economy status (MES), noting that they would keep this under active review and wanted to see some progress at the summit. The Foreign Secretary concluded that the Commission and president would take forward summit negotiations with the Chinese and keep partners fully informed.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.1/13">Uzbekistan</p>
	<p pid="b.129.1/14" class="indent">The Foreign Secretary highlighted the importance of the EU's response to the situation in Uzbekistan. The EU would not solve the problem in one stroke, and should bear in mind its long-term policy towards Uzbekistan and the region as a whole. The Council welcomed the appointment of Jan Kubis as EU Special Representative for Central Asia and noted his intention to travel to the region as soon as possible. The Council agreed to review the EU-Uzbekistan partnership and co-operation agreement in the light of his visit.

	Finance Act 2004: Pre-Owned Asset Regulations
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-21b.134.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="134"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050721/text/50721-19.htm#50721-19_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.134.1/1">My right honourable friend the Paymaster-General (Dawn Primarolo) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/2">This is to announce regulations under Section 104 of the Finance Act 1986 to provide relief from double inheritance tax charges in situations caught by the pre-owned assets provisions at Schedule 15 of the Finance Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/3">Double inheritance tax (IHT) charges can arise in certain circumstances when taxpayers who have used IHT avoidance schemes re-arrange their affairs in response to the income tax charge on &quot;pre-owned assets&quot; introduced by Schedule 15 of the Finance Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/4">My Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-08">8 March 2005</phrase> announced regulations to provide relief from double charges where taxpayers have made an election to disapply the pre-owned asset income tax charge under paragraph 21 of Schedule 15.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/5">Comparable double charges can arise where taxpayers do not make this election, but instead dismantle their previous arrangements so that the pre-owned asset income tax charge is no longer due. In particular, many taxpayers have used a &quot;double trust&quot; scheme; this involves selling a valuable asset to one trust in which the vendor retains an interest, in exchange for an IOU, and then giving the IOU to a second trust. The gift is a potentially exempt transfer for IHT purposes, and the value of the IOU will be chargeable if the scheme user dies within seven years of implementing the scheme. If in the mean time the scheme has been reversed, so that the full value of the asset originally sold is back in the scheme user's ownership at the time of their death, that value will also be subject to IHT.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/6">I am satisfied that scheme users can have legitimate non-avoidance reasons for arranging their affairs in this way, and the regulations already made will therefore be extended to provide relief from double charges which arise from their doing so. They will cover cases where:</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/7" class="indent">a deceased person has made a gift of a debt owed to them;</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/8" class="indent">the gift was chargeable to IHT or becomes so chargeable (by virtue of the donor's death);</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/9" class="indent">the donor dies within seven years of the gift and on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/10" class="indent">the debt was entered into as consideration for the purchase of an asset owned by the donor, or to provide funds for such a purchase; and</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/11" class="indent">the full value of that asset, or of property derived from it, is also chargeable to IHT as part of the donor's estate at death.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/12">In those circumstances, relief will be given so that tax will be due only on the more valuable of the two chargeable assets mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/13">The regulations will be made as soon as practicable and made available on H M Revenue and Customs' website (<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a>).</p>

	<p pid="b.135.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/2">I have today laid before Parliament copies of the Forensic Science Service's (FSS) Annual Report and Accounts for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/3">Performance against agency targets 2004&ndash;05:</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/4">The FSS met 18 of its 20 targets and put in a strong financial performance. Of the two targets not achieved, one was related to timeliness, the other to the Investors in People (IiP) Standard. Although the FSS made further improvements in service delivery times against the previous year, performance fell short of target. A better performance is expected this year. The service was very disappointed to lose its IiP status but has been encouraged by the assessor's view that strong foundations are in place to begin the work to regain the standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/5">The Forensic Science Service agency targets for 2005&ndash;06 are as follows. These targets might be subject to review in the light of the proposed change of status for the FSS.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.3/6" class="italic">Finance</p>

	<p pid="b.136.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Don Touhig) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.1/2">A key principle of the Government's approach to addressing the health concerns of veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict is that there should be appropriate research into veterans' illnesses and factors that may have a bearing on these.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.1/3">The Ministry of Defence has funded a study by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control into the particular interaction of anthrax and pertussis vaccines in mice. The study is part of a wider programme of research into vaccines interactions, which has been overseen by an independent panel of experts. A paper reporting the final results of the study was published in the online version of the journal <i>Human Vaccines</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July 2005</phrase> in advance of hard-copy publication in the August/September edition of the journal. In brief, the researchers report that, in mice, pertussis vaccine, vaccine combinations, or aluminium salt caused illness; anthrax vaccine produced little effect; diluted vaccine combinations produced less serious side effects of shorter duration; and pertussis vaccines act as an adjuvant for anthrax vaccine. As the researchers point out, caution should be exercised in applying these results to humans because of the relatively high dosage used in the tests and the very different sensitivity to these vaccines in mice and humans.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.1/4">This work represents a further step towards meeting the department's commitment to investigate these issues. A full summary of the findings is freely available on the journal website and via a link on the MoD website at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/whats-new.htm">www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/whats&ndash;new.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.138.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Tony McNulty)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/2">As part of the five-year asylum and immigration strategy announced in February, the Government announced their intention to apply targeted screening for TB overseas and at the entry clearance stage, rather than the current practice of screening at UK ports of entry.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/3">While some screening is already carried out routinely in certain countries, our approach will be to prioritise screening of entry clearance applicants wishing to come to the UK for more than six months and coming from countries which combine the highest levels of incidence of TB, as measured by the World Health Organisation, with the highest numbers of potentially infectious travellers to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/4">We will begin an initial phase by the end of the summer in posts in four overseas countries, to test the screening system. The initial countries are Bangladesh, Thailand (which also processes entry clearance applications from Cambodia and Laos), Tanzania and Sudan. These all have high rates of TB, represent the various kinds of entry clearance operation the UK runs globally (outsourced, personal applications and postal/remote applications), and includes those where the medical infrastructure allows the testing phase to be set up quickly. A further announcement will be made early next year regarding the countries to be included in the next phase of the rollout.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/5">Screening overseas at the entry clearance stage will bring many benefits. It will identify infectious travellers who will be asked to complete treatment before applying for entry clearance. It will generate data on infection among travellers to the UK which will enable us to understand better the role of migration on TB infections rates in the UK, and respond with effective health policies. Entry clearance applicants themselves will benefit from health screening which will be conducted to high standards that are quality assured. Host countries will benefit from the earlier identification of individuals with infectious TB. We also aim to share data on infection rates with host countries so as to inform their own public health programmes. We are however mindful that pre-entry screening is only part of dealing effectively with TB globally. We will continue to work with the World Health Organisation to help developing countries diagnose and treat patients. We will evaluate the effect of this policy on our wider development objectives and messages.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/6">We believe the impact on migration will be minimal. But we will examine the experience of other countries already implementing such schemes, such as the US, Australia and Canada, and we will carefully monitor any impact on entry clearance application rates.</p>

The purpose of the forum is to examine the seven relevant recommendations contained in the report and identify how they can be taken forward to enhance removal centre regimes. A number of meetings have already taken place and have involved consultation with HM Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/4">The action plan identifies the recommendations that have already been acted on and what considerations and progress have been made on the others. A completion date for implementation has been set for the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.140.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.3/2">The Government are today publishing summary responses on the remaining issues raised in their consultation on the implementation of the licensing provisions in the Housing Act 2004. These cover the licensing of private-sector houses of multiple occupation (HMOs) in Part 2 of the Act and the discretionary powers for the selective licensing of privately rented properties in areas of low housing demand or significant anti-social behaviour in Part 3 of the Act. This follows on from a statement made by the right honourable Keith Hill MP on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> which covered the principal issues arising from the HMO licensing consultation exercise. Copies of these responses have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.3/3">We are also announcing the Government's intentions on a number of related issues which have been raised by consultees during the period following the end of the formal consultation exercise.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.3/4">The two consultation papers <i>Licensing in the Private Rented Sector: Consultation on the Implementation of HMO Licensing</i> (published in July 2004) and <i>Licensing in the Private Rented Sector: Consultation on the Implementation of Selective Licensing</i> (published in July 2004) sought to explain the Government's proposals for licensing in the private rented sector. They invited interested parties to comment on how the powers should be implemented, and asked questions about the possible form that the necessary items of secondary legislation should take.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.3/5">The consultation period for selective licensing ended in October 2004 and that for HMO licensing in February 2005. There was a considerable amount of cross-over in these exercises which explains the delay in producing the summary of responses for the selective licensing work. We have now analysed all the responses and reached decisions on most of these issues. This has allowed us to start drafting the appropriate secondary legislation to allow these important measures to be commenced by the late autumn of this year. We also plan to phase the introduction of the enforcement provisions over a period of no more than three months from commencement to allow local authorities' licensing procedures to settle down and to allow landlords sufficient time to make their applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.3/6">On most of the remaining issues covered by the consultation paper, the majority of respondents agreed with the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.3/7">The Government are introducing licensing as a measured response to the problems of the private rented sector. They are keen to strike the right balance between setting clear national benchmarks and giving local authorities the discretion to respond to local housing market conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.3/8">A paper detailing the responses to the consultations and the Government's intentions regarding them has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="b.142.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-28">28 October 2004</phrase>, my predecessor, David Blunkett, announced a review of murder.

	Neighbourhood Renewal
</major-heading>

	<p pid="b.142.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/2">I am announcing today the allocation of a total of &pound;1.3 billion new resources for the most deprived areas of England. These new resources for the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) and the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund (SSCF) demonstrate the Government's continued commitment to social justice and opportunity for all, to eradicate social exclusion and anti-social behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/3"><i>The Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) </i>People living in the most disadvantaged areas suffer most from anti-social behaviour and crime. We are determined to ensure, through the NRF, that respect within the community and between individuals is protected.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/4">As part of the Spending Review 2004, the Government announced that they would be making available an additional &pound;1.05 billion for the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) (&pound;525 million for 2006&ndash;07 and a further &pound;525 million for 2007&ndash;08).</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/5">These new resources are in addition to the &pound;1.875 billion NRF the Government made available over the period 2001&ndash;06. The 88 local strategic partnerships (LSPs) who have received NRF have made good progress in using it to help address some of the most serious problems in our most disadvantaged areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/6">The gaps between these areas and the rest on crime, educational attainment and worklessness have narrowed. However, we must not be complacent and must continue to ensure that this progress is sustained and built upon. Reducing the health inequalities gap is a significant challenge and ODPM remains committed to working with the Department of Health and its Spearhead group of local authorities to tackle this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/7">The Government are determined to build momentum to ensure that improvements in quality of life and quality of public services reach the most disadvantaged citizens. Floor targets on employment, education, crime, health, housing and liveability are a public commitment to this work, and the success of some authorities in meeting them shows what is possible. We look forward to continuing our joint work to deliver change.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/8">All the evidence shows that neighbourhood renewal is only successful when changes in the physical environment and improvement in public services are combined with a strong commitment to promote liveability and tackle anti-social behaviour. The determination of local authorities to use the neighbourhood renewal fund to employ neighbourhood wardens and promote after-school provision for young people, side-by-side with active partnership with the police in the use of powers to tackle anti-social behaviour, is delivering real change on the ground. We will be working with local authorities, including through the local area agreement process, to ensure that this approach is embedded in our regeneration activities, and that there is continued innovation to target the activity of the minority of citizens who can blight the lives of the majority.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/9">This new NRF settlement, the largest since the neighbourhood renewal strategy was launched in 2001, recognises and will build upon progress so far, allowing LSPs more resources to help improve service delivery in their most disadvantaged neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/10">I am therefore announcing today the indicative allocations of &pound;1.05 billion NRF resources for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 to 86 local authority districts. Details of allocations to individual local authorities are set out in the attached table (Annex A). Final NRF allocations will be confirmed when the revenue support grant (RSG) is paid to local authorities in November.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/11">NRF will be allocated to any local authority area which falls within the 50 most deprived districts in England on any of the six district level measures of deprivation included in the Index of Deprivation 2004 (ID04). The size of the allocation to each eligible area has been determined by the number of people within the district living in the 10 per cent most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/12">Six of the 88 authorities which are currently receiving NRF have improved sufficiently to come off the list of the most disadvantaged districts in the country. However, these authorities will continue to receive tapering NRF over the next two years. This funding will support these authorities over the transitional period and allow them time to adapt and to sustain the progress they have made to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/13"><i>The Neighbourhood Element of the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund </i>As well as the new NRF allocations, I am also announcing the allocation of two elements of the new Safer and Stronger Communities Fund, the Neighbourhood Element and the Cleaner, Safer, Greener element.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/14">The SSCF is one of the local area agreement funding streams. The neighbourhood element of SSCF is also designed to address deprivation in our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. It will provide funding for 100 of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the country. Details of allocations of the neighbourhood element of SSCF to individual authorities are attached at Annex B. The new ID04 has allowed us to identify small pockets of deprivation in otherwise affluent areas for the first time. This element of the SSCF will target such neighbourhoods, including many beyond those areas that will receive NRF. Neighbourhood element funding is targeted at the 3 per cent most disadvantaged neighbourhoods and is worth &pound;41.3 million and &pound;51.6 million in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 respectively. Between the NRF and the neighbourhood element of SSCF, we will target a higher proportion of the people living in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the country than has ever been possible before.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/15"><i>The Cleaner, Safer, Greener element of the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund </i>There is extensive evidence of a clear correlation between deprivation and poor local environmental quality. The cleaner safer greener element of SSCF, therefore, is being targeted at disadvantaged neighbourhoods in greatest need of improving their local public spaces. This element is worth &pound;48.5 million and &pound;56.5 million in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 respectively. Details of individual allocations of the cleaner, safer, greener element of SSCF are attached at Annex C.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.3/16">Annexes A, B and C have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="b.144.1/1">My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Gareth Thomas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.1/2">DFID has completed a review of its support programme in Nepal. The review was prompted by political events in the early part of the year. DfID plans to continue a substantial programme in the country and the overall purpose of our country assistance plan (CAP) remains unchanged: to reduce poverty and social exclusion, establishing a basis for lasting peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.1/3">However, the conflict and political context have made it more difficult to deliver development assistance effectively and DfID has scaled back the plans in the CAP to increase significantly our levels of assistance. Instead, we plan to keep these at about &pound;32 million&mdash;close to the amount spent in the previous UK financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.1/4">The published CAP had five objectives covering peace-building; improving rural livelihoods; expanding basic services; supporting social inclusion of women and excluded caste and ethnic groups; and improving governance. We have not radically changed these objectives, but have adjusted priorities to give more attention to: possible humanitarian operations and the protection of vulnerable groups such as internally displaced people; and working with pro-democracy groups, including the political parties, to help ensure that an eventual return to democracy is sustained.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.1/5">DfID will strengthen further its risk management systems to ensure that we continue to protect staff and respond in a timely way to further changes in the context in which we are working. We will also build further our skills to manage the programme within a conflict setting.</p>
	<p pid="b.144.1/6">We will continue to work closely with other Whitehall departments, helping to ensure that best use is made of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) and that DfID's activities make a positive contribution to the wider UK objective of a sustainable peace based on democratic government.</p>

	<p pid="b.146.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects to publish in August:</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/3" class="indent">a new planning policy statement on biodiversity and geological conservation;</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/4" class="indent">and an accompanying joint ODPM/Defra government circular: <i>Biodiversity and Geological Conservation&mdash;Statutory obligations and their impact within the Planning System</i>.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/5">The new planning policy statement 9 (PPS9) sets out the Government's planning policies for biodiversity and geological conservation in England. A joint ODPM/Defra circular accompanies PPS9 and will provide administrative guidance on the law relating to planning and nature conservation as it applies in England. Together these two documents will replace existing planning policy guidance note 9 on nature conservation (PPG9), published in October 1994.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/6">Drafts of PPS9 and the accompanying circular were issued for public consultation in September 2004. PPS9 has a new emphasis on the need to conserve, enhance and restore biodiversity and makes it clear that geological conservation is an important part of protecting our natural heritage. Positive planning which facilitates conservation of biodiversity and geological conservation contributes to the Government's principles for sustainable development set out in the UK strategy. The policies set out in PPS9, together with the guidance in the circular will enable planning authorities, regional planning bodies and planning inspectors to play their part taking forward the UK strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/7">It is also our intention to publish, later in the year, good practice guidance to complement the PPS and the circular.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.3/8">Copies of PPS9 and the accompanying government circular will be placed in the Library of the House following publication of the documents. They will also be made available on the website of ODPM. A summary of the responses to the consultation drafts has been published on the ODPM website and copies of the responses will be made available for inspection through the ODPM library.</p>

	<p pid="b.147.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/2">Following my Written Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September 2004</phrase>, and together with the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence, I wish to inform Parliament of the establishment and current capabilities of the Post Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU). The PCRU is an inter-departmental unit, which has been set up by our three departments to improve the United Kingdom's capacity to contribute to the creation of a stable environment in countries emerging from conflict. The unit's work is overseen by the Defence and Overseas Policy (Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction) Committee, chaired by the Foreign Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/3">The PCRU has been established to carry out two main tasks. First, to develop government strategy for post-conflict stabilisation. This includes linking military and civilian planning as well as working with the wider international community for the spread of best practice, capacity building and burden sharing; and, secondly, to plan and direct activities designed to create stability in post conflict environments in the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.3/4">The PCRU is nearly fully staffed and has reached an initial capacity to plan for, and support, stabilisation activities. The unit is building up a database of civilian experts who can be deployed. It is also developing methods to help the Government reach an understanding of, and plan responses to, individual conflicts. In addition, the unit is writing a series of guidance papers on a range of specific issues that may need to be tackled in post-conflict situations, such as security sector reform and governance. The PCRU is also developing links with international organisations and other governments to ensure that UK's efforts are part of a co-ordinated contribution to the international response to conflict. I expect the PCRU to be able, if necessary, to plan and organise a large-scale deployment of up to several hundred civilians, including police, as part of a post-conflict stabilisation operation by mid-2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.148.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/2">As was recognised in the 2003 Defence White Paper<i> Delivering Security in a Changing World</i> (Cm 6041&ndash;I), the international situation that we now face is radically different to that of the Cold War. As a consequence, there have been a great many changes to the size and structure of our Armed Forces as they have adapted to meet this changed environment. I am today announcing two such changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/3">The Cold War radar station of RAF Saga Vord on the Shetland Island of Unst will be put on care and maintenance from April 2006, subject to consultation with the trades unions. This will mean that the station is effectively closed but that the main operational part of the estate will continue to be maintained should it be required for future use. Further work will be undertaken to consider how much of the remainder of the station will be retained.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/4">Radar cover at the level required can be provided by other RAF radars augmented by those of the National Air Traffic Service. Placing the station on care and maintenance means that we would be able to reinstate a radar capability should the threat assessment change. Some 70 service personnel, 30 MoD civilians and 10 contractor staff will be affected by this proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/5">I understand this will be disappointing news for our staff, the island of Unst and the Shetland Islands community. Naturally, we will be happy to work with the Scottish Executive and the local authority to consider any measures within the defence remit that might assist the local community adjust to the proposed change.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/6">As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase>, the role of providing ground based air defence (GBAD) is to be transferred to the Army and the four Royal Air Force GBAD squadrons disbanded.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/7">I am now able to inform the House that 37 Squadron RAF Regiment based at RAF Wittering will disband by March 2006, that 16 Squadron, based at RAF Honington, will disband by March 2007 and that 15 Squadron and the RAF GBAD Wing Headquarters also based at RAF Honington and 26 Squadron based at RAF Waddington, will disband by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/8">This phased programme will allow the Royal Regiment of Artillery to take over the pan-defence GBAD role in a progressive manner. The RAF Regiment will now focus on its role of protecting other elements of the Armed Forces, particularly on deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/9">As part of these changes, both 3 Squadron RAF Regiment, based at RAF Aldergrove, and the Queen's Colour Squadron, based at RAF Uxbridge, will be expanded by around 40 personnel each in order to enhance their operational capability to match that of the other four regular RAF Regiment field squadrons. This will improve the units' ability to deploy on operations and so enhance the operational flexibility of the RAF Regiment in its force protection role.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/10">Around 340 posts will be lost as a result of these changes. These form part of the 7,500 RAF post reductions also announced last July. I do not expect any redundancies additional to those announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-09">9 December 2004</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>WS 102</i>) to result from this announcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/11">As a consequence of the decision taken last July, the RAF has conducted an overall review of the structure and basing of the RAF Regiment. As a result of this work, I have decided that 1 Squadron RAF Regiment will move from RAF St Mawgan to RAF Honington by March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/12">In addition, I have decided that 2625 (County of Cornwall) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment, based alongside 1 Squadron at RAF St Mawgan should be disbanded with effect from November 2006. This decision has been taken as Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment squadrons need to be based alongside regular units in order to maximise training opportunities and give the auxiliary personnel access to equipment held by the regular unit. With 1 Squadron's relocation, this would not be possible at St Mawgan. Around 75 reservists will be affected. Members of 2625 Squadron will be offered the opportunity to continue their reservist activities with other parts of the Armed Forces reservist organisation or with an alternative RAF unit elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.3/13">We are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact on the people affected by these announcements. Our current plans envisage that the majority of reductions will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early release but some compulsory redundancies may prove necessary. Staff and the trade unions are being kept fully informed of developments through meetings, briefings and formal consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.150.5/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" name="Malcolm Wicks">My right honourable friend the Minister for Energy (Mr Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/2">I am making today a Statement to the House on the interaction of existing government policy and planning procedures, with regard to the need for new energy infrastructure, arising from the targets, goals and aspirations for renewable generation set out in the 2003 Energy White Paper <i>Our Energy Future&mdash;Creating a low carbon economy.</i></p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/3">The 2003 Energy White Paper set out four key goals of energy policy:</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/4" class="indent">to put the UK on a path to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by some 60 per cent by about 2050;</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/5" class="indent">to maintain the reliability of energy supplies;</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/6" class="indent">to promote competitive markets in the UK and beyond;</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/7" class="indent">and to ensure that every home is adequately and affordably heated.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/8">The energy White Paper makes it clear that UK energy systems will undergo a significant change over the next 20 years to allow these goals to be met. This means that it will be necessary to update much of the UK's energy infrastructure during that period1. There will be a requirement for:</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/9" class="indent">an expansion in infrastructure (e.g. overhead power lines and underground cables, and pipelines);</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/10" class="indent">new forms of infrastructure (e.g. smaller scale distributed generation, gas storage sites);</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/11" class="indent">and infrastructure development in areas that have not previously seen such developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/12">The energy White Paper also makes it clear that UK energy policy is delivered through a market framework, governed by an independent regulator. Government policy puts in place broad objectives, which are supported by regulation, fiscal regimes and, where necessary, financial support. As with the sector in general, the private sector is best placed to develop the systems that can deliver the demanding new renewables generation targets and objectives in the most economic, efficient and effective way possible2.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/13">This principle applies to decisions about the exact provision and location or route of energy transmission and distribution infrastructure which must be taken within the planning system which ensures that development and changes in land use occur in suitable locations.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/14">Beyond broad targets for renewable electricity and combined heat and power (see energy White Paper) the UK Government do not believe that energy policy should set out a specific fuel mix for electricity generation. Nor has it attempted to determine the best specific location for new facilities to generate electricity power or other kinds of energy infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/15" class="indent">1 For example, energy White Paper, paras 1.16&ndash;1.17, page 10.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/16">2 For example, EWP, para 1.21.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/17">Instead, the UK Government believe that the private sector is best placed to decide exactly what energy infrastructure is needed and how, subject to planning and environmental requirements, to deliver policy objectives most effectively. It therefore falls to the developer to demonstrate the desirability of a particular scheme in a particular location. For the monopoly transmission and distribution networks this is to be achieved within the price controls set by the regulator.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/18">A slightly different approach has been taken in Wales where the Assembly Government has set out in its revised technical advice note (TAN) 8 that 800MW of additional capacity will be required to be provided by large-scale on-shore wind by 2010. TAN8 has identified specific areas considered suitable for large-scale on-shore wind farm development. The capacity of the electricity distribution system to accommodate sufficient wind energy developments is a key influence on the shape and distribution of proposals in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/19">The provision of energy infrastructure is part of a delivery system that provides an essential national service. Business and homes in the UK require a reliable supply of energy free from disruption and interruption. New energy infrastructure projects may not appear to convey any particular local benefit and may indeed have adverse local effects, but they do provide crucial national benefits, which all localities share. In particular, projects will usually add to the reliability of national energy supply, from which every user of the system benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/20">Failure to put energy infrastructure in place will, immediately or over time (and individually, incrementally or cumulatively), reduce the reliability of energy systems, with potentially disastrous consequences for the local, regional and national community and economy. Energy infrastructure projects often have long lead times and/or cater for longer-term needs, based on careful forward planning by energy companies. Therefore, even where new projects may not appear to have immediate benefits, failure to put them in place may reduce future reliability.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/21">In remoter areas, where new renewable generation is to take place, new distribution and transmission networks will be required as a consequence of the need to achieve (through new energy sources as part of a package of measures) the Government's energy policy objectives. Electricity generation is itself a key source of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas. How electricity is generated will play a crucial part in whether the Government will be able to deliver its international commitments and its domestic goal for a 20 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions in 2010 (set out in the UK climate change strategy) and, ultimately, reductions of 60 per cent by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/22">The Government have therefore set targets for the expansion of renewable forms of electricity generation; which produce low CO2 emissions or no CO2 emissions at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/23"><i>Renewable Energy </i>The UK Government have set a target that generation from renewable sources (wind power, wave power, biomass, hydropower, solar power and so on) should supply 10 per cent of the UK electricity in 2010. The Government's aspiration is by 2020 to double renewable energy's share of electricity to 20 per cent. The Scottish Executive has set a target that 18 per cent of its electricity will come from renewables by 2010, and recently consulted about raising this to 40 per cent by 2020. In Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government has set benchmark targets of 4TWh per annum of renewable energy production by 2010 and 7TWh by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/24">The expansion of renewable energy is essential as a part of a package of measures to meet the Government's CO2 reduction targets and mitigate future global climate change, which could have significant impacts on all areas of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/25">Renewable energy will also provide economic benefits for the UK economy. Often, individual renewables developments can offer economic benefits to local areas in terms of jobs, investment and revitalisation of the rural economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/26">As with all energy infrastructure, however, there will be occasions when such developments may appear to offer few local benefits, but will still add to the essential resilience of national energy systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/27">Renewable generation infrastructure needs to be developed where sufficient renewable energy resources exist for it to be economic and effective. For example, wind turbines generally require average wind speeds of more than 4 to 5 metres per second; and biomass installations need access to sufficient sources of biomass fuel within the local area. The recommended radius for energy crops is 25 miles or 40 kilometres under Defra's energy crops planting scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/28">However, developers will be best placed to make a judgment about the technical feasibility and economic viability of individual projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/29">Renewable energy resources are distributed widely throughout the UK. Therefore, for UK renewables targets to be met, a significant amount of new renewable generation infrastructure will need to be built in every region of the UK, often in local areas that have not previously housed generation infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.150.5/30">I am today placing in the Libraries of the House a fuller note setting out government policy which is intended to provide assistance by being a material consideration of significant weight in planning decisions on energy infrastructure.</p>

	Schools: Funding
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-07-21b.153.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="153"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050721/text/50721-24.htm#50721-24_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.153.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Schools and 14 to 19 Learning (Jacqui Smith) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/2">This Statement relates to schools' recurrent funding from 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/3">In February this year my department launched a consultation on proposed new arrangements for school funding from 2006&ndash;07. The proposals were designed to deliver greater certainty and stability for schools, building on the package of measures that we put in place in 2004&ndash;05. In particular, they were designed to guarantee delivery of the government's commitment to increase spending on schools in every local authority area, to provide schools with the tools to take a strategic approach to their financial planning, to reduce bureaucracy and to give schools greater control over how they used the resources available to them for the benefit of their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/4">I am today publishing a summary of the responses to the consultation and placing a copy of that summary in the Library of the House. I am grateful to all those who responded to the consultation, and in particular to our national partners with whom we have been discussing detailed implementation issues in parallel with the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/5">For the most part, the Government's proposals were welcomed by respondents to the consultation, who recognised the significant benefits that they would bring for schools. However, it is clear from the responses we received and from our discussions with partners that some aspects of the proposals imply significant changes to the way in which local authorities manage the budget-setting process. The government also recognises that it is critical that changes to the school funding system&mdash;and in particular those which affect the distribution of funds between local authorities or schools&mdash;are introduced gradually, in order to avoid a repeat of the financial difficulties which some schools experienced in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/6">We therefore intend that the two years 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 should be a transitional period, and that the new arrangements should be introduced in full from 2008&ndash;09. During the first two years we will review a number of aspects of the system to ensure that when the new arrangements are fully implemented from 2008 they will be on a sound footing, and that funding is distributed in the most appropriate way possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/7">The introduction of three year budgets for schools was widely welcomed by respondents to the consultation. From 2008&ndash;09, schools will receive three year budgets in line with the Spending Review cycle.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/8">In the short term, the Government's decision to review its spending plans using a zero-based approach, to report in 2007, means that schools will receive a two-year budget settlement in early 2006 to cover 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, but will not receive information for future years until after the spending review has reported. We intend to review the way in which the budget setting process has worked during 2006 and 2007, so that we can make any changes to the arrangements I am announcing today if necessary to ensure that the first full three-year settlement in 2008&ndash;09 is implemented smoothly.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/9">It remains the Government's aim to move school budgets on to an academic year basis in due course. However, although many respondents welcomed this proposal, some practical concerns were raised which we believe we should discuss further with our partners before making a final decision. It also makes sense to let the other changes we are introducing in 2006 bed down before making this further change. School budgets for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 will therefore be set on a financial rather than an academic year basis, but we will review during that period whether to move to an academic year basis for setting budgets from 2008&ndash;09.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/10">In deciding on how to implement multi-year budgets at school level, it has been necessary to strike a balance between certainty on the one hand and responsiveness to changed circumstances on the other. So we will require authorities to make key decisions before the start of each multi-year period, including the transitional two-year period starting in 2006&ndash;07: for example, how their local funding formula should work, and what the split should be between the amount of funding delegated to schools and the amount retained centrally by the local authority. But we will also allow flexibility for these decisions subsequently to be reconsidered in exceptional circumstances, and where the local schools forum agrees. This will be important to allow authorities to deal with significant and unexpected changes in circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/11">We have also considered carefully how far we need to be prescriptive in terms of how multi-year budgets for individual schools are put together, and how far we can leave this to local discretion. We have concluded that it is essential that budgets are updated annually to reflect changes in pupil numbers; and we propose to require authorities to use a consistent approach to this. However, we believe that other decisions&mdash;in particular the extent to which annual changes should be made to reflect changes in other data&mdash;should be taken locally in discussion with the Schools Forum, to ensure that local circumstances can be fully taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/12">The Learning and Skills Council will be carrying out its own consultation in the early autumn on its arrangements for providing school sixth forms with a two-year settlement in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/13">Two key safeguards which were introduced into the system in 2004&ndash;05 will remain. The first is the minimum funding guarantee for schools, which will be the key guarantor of stability in schools' budgets during the transition to the new arrangements. There will continue to be a need for the detailed operation of the guarantee to be varied where it would otherwise produce an anomalous outcome due to local circumstances, and in future we intend that some variations of this kind should be agreed locally by the schools forum and come to the Secretary of State only where they cannot be locally agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/14">The minimum funding guarantee will be set in advance for the whole of the period covered by schools' budgets. The Government's intention is to set the guarantee for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 at a level which covers anticipated average cost pressures on schools in each of those years, including the full-year costs of implementing workforce reform, subject to a final assessment of those pressures. The precise level of the guarantee in each year will be announced in the autumn. We intend to review the way in which the guarantee should operate from 2008&ndash;09 onwards, including the link to cost pressures, with a view to ensuring that it leaves sufficient scope to redistribute funding in a way which responds to changing needs and priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/15">The Learning and Skills Council has confirmed that it will match the minimum funding guarantee for secondary schools in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. The Learning and Skills Development Agency has however today published a report which identifies some technical anomalies between the school sixth form and further education funding systems: we intend to examine the scope for addressing these, and will announce our conclusions in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/16">The second key safeguard for schools in the current system is the limit on centrally retained expenditure within the schools budget: this ensures that the local authority's centrally retained budget cannot increase at a faster rate than funding delegated to the authority's schools, unless there are exceptional circumstances. This limit will continue to operate in essentially the same way as now; but in future any proposal by an authority to exceed the limit because of exceptional circumstances will need agreed locally by the schools forum and only come to the Secretary of State where it can't be locally agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/17">The introduction of a ring-fenced grant for schools, or dedicated schools grant (DSG) is an essential precursor to three-year budgets for schools. Grant will be allocated to authorities to cover the same period for which we will require them to give their schools budget allocations, in line with the spending review cycle. That means we will allocate grant to cover 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 initially, and in late 2007 we will give authorities a three-year settlement covering 2008&ndash;09 to 2010&ndash;11.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/18">The baseline for the DSG at national level will be the total of authorities' budgeted expenditure on schools provision in 2005&ndash;06. I can confirm that, as set out in the five-year strategy for children and learners, the dedicated schools grant for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 will increase by 6 per cent over that baseline in each year. Every authority will receive an increase of at least 5 per cent per pupil in both 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. To protect schools in authorities with rapidly falling rolls, there will also be a minimum overall increase for authorities in cash terms: we will announce in the autumn the level at which that will be set.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/19">The baseline for each individual authority will also start from its existing level of spend: there will be no need for authorities to add to the schools budget from their own resources in order to maintain spending at the current level. It nevertheless remains true that if we use the existing schools formula spending share (SFSS) distribution methodology to distribute the DSG as proposed in our consultation document, schools in authorities which currently spend above their SFSS allocation will, over time, see their funding level reduced in relative terms. A number of authorities have raised concerns about this. We have also been considering further whether the current approach, using a single formula, remains the most appropriate method for the distribution of DSG, under a system in which it determines far more closely the overall level of funding received by schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/20">These two considerations have caused us to consider a modified method of distribution which takes the existing level of spend as the baseline, and gives every authority a minimum increase in its per pupil budget each year: as I have explained, this will be 5 per cent in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. The remaining grant would be distributed according to criteria which would be determined by Ministers in advance of each multi-year budget period. Distribution against these criteria would be through a formula based on objective data.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/21">It would be possible for the existing SFSS formula to be used to determine the distribution of some or all of the increase above the minimum per pupil increase. We propose to keep the formula running in its current form, subject to some minor technical changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/22">We believe it is important to seek the views of local authorities and others on this proposal before deciding whether to go ahead. We therefore intend to publish a consultation document shortly which will set out the proposals in more detail. We expect to announce final decisions, along with provisional allocations for individual authorities, in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/23">Because the modified method of distribution which we are proposing is in part a response to the problems of transition to the new system, we would propose to review its operation, to consider what lessons can be learned from the first two years of operation of the DSG, and also to work up proposals for the longer term. Equity of funding will be a key consideration in that review. We intend to complete that review by the summer of 2007, in time for the first three year allocations of DSG later that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/24">The purpose of the ring-fenced grant is, of course, that money intended for schools reaches schools. The dedicated schools grant will therefore be paid to authorities on condition that it is allocated in its entirety to the authority's schools budget. However, an issue raised in the consultation was whether local authorities should be able to include money from the schools budget along with money from other local authority services and other agencies in combined budgets in support of <i>Every Child Matters</i> work. We have concluded that they should be able to do so, where they can demonstrate that there are clear benefits for schools and pupils, and so long as the educational benefit is broadly proportionate to the contribution made and the schools forum agrees.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/25">The consultation document also proposed a rationalisation of standards-related grants, to reduce complexity and bureaucracy and give schools greater freedom over how they spend their budgets. These proposals were broadly welcomed by respondents.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/26">We therefore propose to combine a number of existing grants into a single school development grant from April 2006, as set out in the consultation document. To ensure stability for schools as we move to the new arrangements, the distribution of that grant in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 will reflect the current distribution of its constituent grants. The grant will be increased each year in line with the minimum funding guarantee, and this will be funded through a transfer from the DSG: that amount, and the allocations available to individual authorities, will be announced in the autumn. We intend to end matched funding for school grants through a transfer from the dedicated schools grant to specific grants.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/27">Respondents to the consultation also agreed that it was necessary to retain some separate grants. Some will remain separate because they are targeted at particular schools, or time-limited. We have an existing commitment to keep the ethnic minority achievement grant separate and ring-fenced until at least 2008. And some grants are spent at local authority level and are not devolved to schools: grants in this last category are being considered as part of a separate exercise to rationalise local authority grants.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/28">The school standards grant will remain separate from the consolidated grant in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. We will replace the existing distribution methodology with a fairer formula based on a flat rate per school plus a per pupil amount, with transitional arrangements to ensure that no school loses out. Details will be announced in the autumn. Additional resources were allocated to the school standards grant in the Budget to help schools meet the challenges of developing extended services. As a result, from 2006&ndash;07 schools will be able to spend their school standards grant to support extended services.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/29">From 2008&ndash;09, we will consider bringing the school development grant and the school standards grant together into a single standards grant. We will consult fully on how that grant should be distributed in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/30">The consultation document proposed that it should be possible, with schools forum agreement, for authorities to increase the amount they held back from the single grant from 2008&ndash;09 onwards. On reflection, we have decided not to go ahead with this proposal: we believe we should be working towards a position where schools decide for themselves whether to buy into additional central support from their authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/31">Schools forums will have a key role to play both during the transitional period and in the longer term. They currently have an important role as an advisory body, and this will continue. But from 2006&ndash;07 we will also be giving them a number of decision-making responsibilities. These powers will relate to areas where we are providing some flexibility for authorities to move away from the requirements of the school funding regulations in order to take account of specific local circumstances: in the past it has only been possible to exercise such flexibilities with the approval of the Secretary of State. The government believes it is right that it should be possible to agree to the exercise of these flexibilities locally if a consensus can be reached. Where that is not the case, the authority will retain the right to apply to the Secretary of State for a decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/32">The evidence is that many schools forums are already working effectively. However, as their role changes from a purely advisory one to one in which they will also be asked to make a range of important decisions on behalf of schools, it is clearly essential that schools can have confidence in those decisions. That means ensuring that forums' constitutions and proceedings are appropriate to their new role, and that they have access to appropriate support and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/33">We therefore intend to make a number of changes to the existing regulations governing forums' constitution and proceedings, and draft regulations are being issued for consultation today. In addition we will publish, early in the autumn term, a good practice guide for schools forums and a range of other guidance to support them in exercising their new responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/34">In advance of the first three-year budget settlement in 2008&ndash;09, we propose a wider review of the role of schools forums, and the way in which they are working. We will want to look in particular at the question of whether Forums are properly representative of the schools in their areas, and ensure that they have access to appropriate advice and support to ensure that they exercise their responsibilities effectively. We will also want to consider whether the remit of forums remains right given changes in the school system since they were established: we might for example want to consider whether they should have a role in considering capital as well as recurrent funding issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/35">Once they are fully implemented, the new arrangements I have outlined today will give schools greater certainty over their future budgets than ever before. And in doing so, they will provide schools with the tools they need to plan ahead with confidence, to improve their financial management, and to link their financial planning to the outcomes they are aiming to achieve. Taken together with other measures under the <i>New Relationship with Schools</i> which will provide a sharper focus on priorities for improvement specific to individual schools, these measures will ensure that each pound spent on school funding will have a greater impact in terms of delivering better education for our children.</p>
	<p pid="b.153.1/36">My department is issuing detailed guidance on the new arrangements to local authorities and others today. A copy of that guidance will be placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.164.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (Jane Kennedy) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.1/2">The Government's response to the second report of the House of Commons Health Committee on the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in Hospitalised Patients, Cm 6635, has been published today.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.1/3">Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.1/4">Patient safety is a priority for this Government. Whilst a great deal of progress has been made towards improving patient safety, we recognise that much more needs to be done to prevent deaths from venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalised patients. The Committee's estimation of 25,000 deaths a year due to VTE is a serious issue which requires rapid and comprehensive action and we welcome the advice and information the Committee has provided to help the Government tackle this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.1/5">As an immediate step the Chief Medical Officer has written to all doctors to remind them of the clinical guidance which exists.</p>
	<p pid="b.164.1/6">Overall, the challenge is to make sure that good practice is spread within the whole National Health Service. We will therefore set up an independent expert working group which will make recommendations on developing a national strategy on the prevention and treatment of VTE.</p>
