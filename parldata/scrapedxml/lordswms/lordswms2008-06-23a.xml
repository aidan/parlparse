</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-06-23a.87.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100955" speakername="Lord Malloch-Brown" colon=":" colnum="87"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80623-wms0001.htm#80623-wms0001.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.87.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Jim Murphy) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) and I represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/3">The agenda items covered were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/4">General Affairs</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/5"><I>Preparation of the European Council on 19</I><I> and </I><phrase class="date" code="2008-06-20">20 June</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/6">Foreign Ministers discussed the agenda of the June European Council, including freedom, security and justice; the policy implications of high global food and oil prices; economic, social and environmental issues; the western Balkans (covered separately below); and external relations issues, in particular the European neighbourhood policy; and the millennium development goals (MDGs).</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/7">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary broadly supported the draft European Council conclusions on food and oil prices, and called for the reiteration of commitments on carbon capture and storage. He also supported the text on MDGs, but asked that it include both the full text of the overseas development aid targets agreed at the Development Council in May and language supporting the EU agenda for action on the MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/8">Ministers discussed follow-up to the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty. I refer honourable Members to the Statement that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs made to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-16">16 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/9">Foreign Ministers will meet at the European Council. The agenda will cover Kosovo, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Sudan, China/Tibet and transatlantic relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/10"><I>Presentation of the draft three-presidency 18-month programme</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/11">France, Sweden and the Czech Republic presented a programme setting out the joint priorities for their presidencies, running from July 2008 to the end of 2009. These priorities included reassessing the EU budget; climate change; ensuring secure, competitive and environmentally sustainable energy; implementing the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth; promoting the EU's competitiveness; sustainable development; reviewing the common agricultural policy; developing an area of freedom, security and justice; enlargement; the western Balkans; strengthening relations with the EU's eastern and southern neighbours; the relationship with Africa; the European security strategy and meeting the MDGs. The Government broadly support the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/12">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/13"><I>Western Balkans</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/14">Ministers agreed council conclusions, which the Government support, reiterating the EU's commitment to the western Balkans' European perspective and encouraging the countries of that region to meet the necessary conditions. The council also condemned the violence during the <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-01">1 June</phrase> elections in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), and regretted shortcomings in the conduct of those elections. It called on the authorities to investigate these incidents and take appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/15">Ministers also discussed draft European council conclusions on a range of western Balkans issues and signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which the Government welcome. The council encouraged BiH to sustain the reform momentum by implementing the agreement and the priorities set out in its European partnership. Ministers further welcomed visa liberalisation roadmaps setting out requirements for western Balkans countries working towards visa-free travel to the Schengen area. These do not impact on the UK, which is not a party to the Schengen agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/16">Lack of time prevented discussion of Kosovo, which Foreign Ministersagreed to cover at the June European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/17"><I>Middle East</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/18">Ministers discussed the state of play on the Middle East peace process and the EU-Israel Association Council, which met in the margins of the GAERC.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/19"><I>Great Lakes</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/20">Ministers approved without discussion conclusions that acknowledged the progress made towards peace in the region in recent months; and reaffirmed the EU's contribution to reform of the security sector in DRC through two ESDP missions and Commission activity, which will help protect civilians by curtailing human rights abuses, upholding respect for the rule of law and ending the culture of impunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/21"><I>Sudan</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/22">International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Ocampo briefed Ministers on the ICC's activities concerning Sudan. Ministers adopted council conclusions that reiterated the EU's support for the work of the ICC, deeply deplored the Government of Sudan's continued non-co-operation with the ICC and noted that the council stood ready to consider measures against individuals responsible for not co-operating, should the obligation under the UNSC Resolution 1593 on co-operation with the ICC continue to be disregarded. The conclusions expressed concern over the recent fighting between north and south Sudan armed forces in the disputed border region of Abyei, welcomed the Abyei roadmap agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-08">8 June</phrase>, and called on both sides to fulfil the obligations under the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA). The conclusions condemned the Justice and Equality Movement's attack on Omdurman on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-10">10 May</phrase>; reiterated the council's readiness to take further measures against any party impeding UNAMID, obstructing humanitarian access, or failing constructively to engage in the Darfur political process; and called on the Governments of Chad and Sudan to adhere to the Dakar agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/23"><I>Somalia</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/24">Ministers approved without discussion council conclusions that reaffirmed the EU's commitment to a comprehensive and sustainable approach for a settlement of the Somali crisis; reiterated the urgent need to continue the momentum of an inclusive dialogue for a sustained political solution; welcomed UN Security Council resolution 1816 of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase> on acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia; and commissioned work on options for implementing all commitments contained in the council conclusions of <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-26">26 May</phrase>, as well as contributing to the implementation of UNSCR 1816.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/25"><I>Zimbabwe</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/26">Lack of time prevented discussion of Zimbabwe, which Foreign Ministers will now cover at the June European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/27"><I>Iran</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/28">High Representative Solana briefed Ministers on his visit to Tehran on 14 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-15">15 June</phrase>, during which he presented an updated package of proposals to the Iranian authorities, on behalf of France, Germany, the UK, China, Russia, the US and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/29"><I>China</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/30">Ministers briefly discussed dialogue between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama, welcoming the renewal of talks.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/31"><I>Georgia</I></p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/32">High Representative Solana briefed Ministers on his visit to Georgia on 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-06">6 June</phrase>, where he discussed Abkhazia. Ministers broadly agreed that the EU should make a practical contribution to confidence-building measures.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-06-23a.89.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="89"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80623-wms0001.htm#80623-wms0001.htm_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.89.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Rosie Winterton) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/2">I attended the second Transport Council of the Slovenian presidency, in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-13">13 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/3">In road transport, the council reached a political agreement on each of three legislative proposals: the recast regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market; the regulation on common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; and the recast regulation on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services. Presidency compromise texts took into account the concerns of several member states, including the UK, in relation to cabotage and the Commission's report in June 2009 on the future inclusion of vehicle registration data on the national registers of operators. The agreed texts of all three proposals are acceptable to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/4">The council reached a general approach on a recast directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers. The text was acceptable to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/5">The council adopted conclusions, acceptable to the UK, on multi-annual contracts for rail infrastructure quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/6">The council reached a general approach on a directive on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. We support the principle of using public procurement to help stimulate the market for greener vehicles. The revised text presented to council, which we were able to accept, is a significant improvement over the original. However, I informed the council that we regret the lack of a formal impact assessment. We will want, with the Commission, to keep the costs and benefits of the proposed measures under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/7">The council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations towards an EU/western Balkans transport treaty. The UK supports the decision and welcomes this opportunity to work towards improvement of the infrastructure of the western Balkans and better transport links.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/8">The council adopted decisions authorising the Commission to open negotiations on comprehensive air transport agreements with Australia and New Zealand. The UK supports the opening of negotiations with these countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/9">Under AOB, I was pleased to be able, jointly with the Irish Minister, Mr Noel Dempsey, to inform the council of the recently agreed Ireland/UK functional airspace block (FAB). This is the first FAB to be established within the framework of the European single European sky legislation. It is a demonstration of the two countries' commitment to delivering the single European sky initiative. The FAB is designed to deliver real operational efficiencies irrespective of existing national airspace boundaries.</p>
