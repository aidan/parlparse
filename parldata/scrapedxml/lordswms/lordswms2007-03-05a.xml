	<p pid="a.1.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">The 2007 report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) has now been published. I wish to express my thanks to the chairman and members of the review body for their report. I am pleased to confirm that the AFPRB's recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">In line with the AFPRB recommendations, the basic military salary for officers and all other ranks will increase by 3.3 per cent. In addition, a restructuring of pay range 1 will see those on the lowest pay level, some 13,000 service men and women, receive a total pay increase of 9.2 per cent. A further 6,000 service personnel on the next lowest level will receive 6.2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/4">The rates of specialist pay, including flying pay, submarine pay, diving pay and hydrographic pay, will also increase by 3.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/5">The Government have also accepted the AFPRB's recommendation to introduce additional targeted financial retention incentives for Royal Marine and Infantry Other Ranks, and an extension to the aircrew financial retention incentive, in order to meet specific challenges in retaining our experienced people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/6">Also, the AFPRB has confirmed its support for the introduction of the tax-free operational allowance, which I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 175) and has so far been paid to around 31,000 service men and women who have served in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans; and the removal of the 100-day initial qualifying period for the longer separation allowance. Together these measures demonstrate this Government's commitment to provide special recognition for those serving their country on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/7">Copies of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body report are available in the Vote Office and the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" name="Geoff Hoon">My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Geoff Hoon)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/2">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-05">5 March</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mrs. Margaret Beckett) and I will represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/3">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/4"><I>General Affairs</I></p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/5">Preparation of the European Council on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="">9 March</phrase>: The Council will discuss the draft agenda for the Spring European Council on 8 to <phrase class="date" code="">9 March</phrase>, including climate and energy security, better regulation and the Lisbon agenda.

	<p pid="a.5.1/8"><I>Sudan</I>: The Council will discuss support for the African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur (AMIS). The presidency is leading an initiative to secure further EU funds for the African Union, both bilaterally and through the Commission. We will be indicating our support for this initiative and will join the presidency in encouraging member states that have not yet committed significant funds to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/9">We also expect the Council to adopt conclusions calling on the Sudanese Government to give explicit consent to the UN heavy support package for the peacekeeping force, condemning Sudanese non-co-operation with the UN Human Rights Council and reiterating the need for an inclusive political process under the African Union-UN initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/10"><I>Uzbekistan</I>: We expect the Council to discuss the human rights situation in Uzbekistan ahead of the review in May of the EU measures imposed after the Andizhan killings.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.1/12"><I>Western Balkans</I>: The main focus of discussion is likely to be Bosnia. We expect the Council to adopt conclusions welcoming the outcome of this week's Peace Implementation Council, which is likely to extend the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and the Bonn powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/13"><I>Iran</I>: The Council is expected to adopt conclusions deploring Iran's non-compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737, underlining the Security Council's intention to adopt further measures and reiterating EU support for a negotiated solution.

	<p pid="a.7.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Health Services (Rosie Winterton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/2">We shall lay before Parliament regulations to increase National Health Service charges in England from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>. There will be a cash increase in the prescription charge of 20p, from &pound;6.65 to &pound;6.85, for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/3">The cost of prescription prepayment certificates will rise to &pound;35.85 for a four-month certificate and &pound;98.70 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for those needing more than five items in four months or 14 in one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/4">Prescription charges are expected to raise some &pound;425 million for the NHS in 2007-08. Charges for elastic stockings and tights, wigs and fabric supports supplied through the hospital services will be increased similarly.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/5">For courses of dental treatment begun on or after <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, the charge for band 1 will be &pound;15.90, band 2 will be &pound;43.60, and band 3 will be &pound;194.00.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/6">All these increases are below the current level of inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/7">In order to continue to provide help with the cost of spectacles or contact lenses to children, people on low income and individuals with complex sight problems, optical voucher values will rise by an average of 2.7 per cent. NHS charges and optical voucher values in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are a matter for the devolved Administrations. Details of the revised prescription, dental charges and optical voucher values have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/8">In due course, we shall lay regulations to make 12-month pre-payment certificates (PPC) available from July 2007 via direct debit instalments and to replace the four-month PPC with a three-month PPC at a fee of &pound;26.85.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/2">I am responding on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to the twenty-second report of the Review Body for Nursing and Other Health Professions (NOHPRB), Cm 7029, and the thirty-sixth report of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB), Cm 7025, which were laid before Parliament yesterday. The reports have been placed in the Library, and copies are available in the Vote Office for honourable Members. I am grateful to the chairs and members of the review bodies for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/3">The NOHPRB has recommended an increase in the agenda for change pay rates of 2.5 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>. It has also recommended that the minimum and maximum high-cost area supplements should be increased by 2.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/4">The DDRB has recommended that the basic rate of pay for junior doctors should be increased by &pound;650&mdash;equivalent to about &pound;1,000 when the banding multiplier is applied&mdash;and that of all other hospital doctors by &pound;1,000. It has also recommended that the top and bottom of the salary range for salaried general medical practitioners should be increased by &pound;1,000. In addition, it has recommended a zero increase in GP pay and an increase of 3 per cent in the gross earnings base for general dental practitioners. The DDRB calculates that its recommendations will increase the NHS medical and dental pay bill per head by just under 2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/5">The review bodies' pay recommendations are being accepted; however, to ensure consistency with the Government's inflation target, and in line with other parts of the public sector, the awards will be staged. All awards that represent an increase up to and including 1.5 per cent will be paid in full from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase>. But all awards which represent an increase above 1.5 per cent will be paid in two stages, with 1.5 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> and the balance from <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>. The Government recognise that the staff affected will be disappointed that their award is not being paid in full from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase>, but we believe that this approach is fair for staff, consistent with the Government's inflation target and affordable for the NHS.</p>

The basic increase will be implemented from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, and the efficiency award will be implemented following confirmation from the PSPRB that the efficiency element of the package has been delivered.

	<p pid="a.9.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Gerry Sutcliffe) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/2">The sixth report of the independent Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) on the pay of governing governors and other operational managers, prison officers and related support grades in England and Wales in 2007 has been published today and copies placed in the Library. I thank the chair and members of the PSPRB for their hard work in producing their recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/3">The PSPRB has recommended a restructuring of the prison officer pay scale to a new seven-point scale and a restructuring of the pay ranges for governing governors and other operational managers within a new 21-point spine, from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>. The PSPRB has also recommended for those staff not affected by the restructuring (principal and senior prison officers, prison officers on the second long-service incremental point and unified support grades) an increase in basic pay of 2.5 per cent. The recommendations will lead to a 2.8 per cent growth in the overall pay bill, to &pound;888 million, excluding oncosts.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/4">Although I have decided that the PSPRB's recommendations will be implemented in full, the Government have announced that all pay review body awards&mdash;including to doctors, dentists, nurses and judges, as well as prison officers&mdash;will be staged so as to be consistent with the Government's wider economic objectives to secure economic stability and steady growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/5">The key pay review body recommendations are:</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/6">restructuring of the prison officer pay scale to a new seven-point scale;restructuring of the pay ranges for operational managers within a new 21-point spine;required hours addition for operational managers to be uprated by 2.5 per cent;the &quot;Operation Tornado&quot; emergency response payment to prison officers to be uprated to &pound;18 per hour;on-call allowances and dirty protest payment uprated by 2.5 per cent;a 2.5 per cent increase to the basic pay rates of principal and senior prison officers, prison officers on the existing second long-service incremental pay point and unified support grades; and all other allowances and ex-gratia payments to remain at their current levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/7">Recommendations 1 to 5 will be implemented from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase>. Recommendations 1 and 2 will benefit those below the top pay scale by up to 10 per cent. Recommendation 6 will be paid in two stages: 1.5 per cent will be paid from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, in line with other pay review bodies, with the balance to 2.5 per cent paid from l November 2007. The cost of the award will be met from within the delegated budget allocation for the Prison Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/8">The Government remain committed to the independent pay review body process. They do not take decisions to stage recommendations lightly. This year's decisions do not provide any indication of future responses.</p>
