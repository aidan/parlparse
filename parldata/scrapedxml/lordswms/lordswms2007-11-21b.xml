	<p pid="b.115.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Competitiveness (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.3/2">I will be attending the EU Competitiveness Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.3/3">The main substantive item will be an integrated approach to competitiveness covering industry policy, e-skills, SMEs, succeeding in the age of globalisation, and European competitiveness. This will comprise the presentation of communications from the Commission and the adoption of council conclusions, and will be followed by an exchange of views on all five items. The UK will argue strongly in favour of a presumption towards openness when developing the EU's external policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.3/4">Further agenda items for which BERR is responsible are:</p>
	<p pid="b.115.3/5">better regulation (progress report followed by an exchange of views). This will be an opportunity for Ministers to debate the issue of how to improve legislation coming from Europe in advance of a review by the European Commission early next year, which will look at better understanding the economic impact of regulation, better consultation, and keeping red tape to a minimum;communication from the Commission on a simplified business environment for companies in the areas of company law, accounting and auditing (adoption of council conclusions). The UK will look to agree the text of conclusions, offering strong support for the Commission's simplification programme for company law;communication from the Commission on enhancing the patent system in Europe (progress report followed by an exchange of views). The Portuguese presidency has laid solid foundations for further work towards a European patent court and the UK welcomes its efforts, but, as its report recognises, further work needs to be done to ensure the creation of a high quality, efficient and affordable jurisdiction which delivers clear benefits to innovative businesses in Europe;proposal to amend the timeshare directive (progress report followed by an exchange of views). The UK is pleased with progress to date and hopes to see further progress in resolving the remaining issues; andcommunication from the Commission on agenda for sustainable and competitive European tourism (presentation by the Commission followed by adoption of council conclusions). The UK supports the Commission policy paper and conclusions, which recognises the importance of the development of tourism as a competitive economic activity, the need to balance this with environmental and social aims, and responds to the aims set out by the Lisbon agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.3/6">There will be nine further items taken under any other business:</p>
	<p pid="b.115.3/7">review of the single market (information from the Commission);free movement of goods (information from the presidency);classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (information from the presidency);events during the Portuguese presidency (information from the presidency);the internet of things (information from the presidency); product safety (information from the Commission);services of general interest (information from the Commission);trade defence instruments (information from the Commission); and legal protection of designs (information from the presidency).</p>

The UK supports the objectives of these JTIs which we see as important for engaging UK businesses in European research and would like to see them launched by the end of this year;a possible general approach on a proposal for a European Parliament and council decision on the ambient assisted living initiative. The UK is supportive of the general aims of AAL and the Technology Strategy Board is intending to participate in the initiative;possible adoption of council conclusions on the future of science and technology in Europe;possible adoption of council conclusions on scientific information in the digital age: access, dissemination and preservation.

	<p pid="b.118.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/2">Patients rightly expect high standards of cleanliness and hygiene in all National Health Service settings.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/3">Today, the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) is publishing information on the 2007 inspection results of the patient environment action teams. In 2000, we introduced patient environment action teams (PEAT) which assess every inpatient healthcare facility in England with more than 10 beds each year. The inspection looks at issues of hospital cleanliness, the quality of the environment, food and privacy and dignity.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/4">Figures published today by the NPSA show that in 2007, 98 per cent of hospitals were rated excellent, good or acceptable: up from 95 per cent in 2006. This is against a more rigorous process in 2007 than for 2006 for the inspection process for PEAT.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/5">The full data are available from the NPSA website at <a href="http://www.npsa.nhs.uk/peat">www.npsa.nhs.uk/peat</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/6">As part of our drive to improve cleanliness further, my department recently announced a deep clean of all our hospitals to supplement ongoing cleaning. My department is making available further information on the funding to support the deep clean of the NHS at regional level. The following table outlines the indicative spending intentions for each SHA area. All trusts will have to submit detailed deep-clean plans, including costs to their primary care trusts and strategic health authorities. Foundation trusts will also be invited to agree plans and funding for additional deep cleaning with local commissioners. Trusts are aiming to complete all deep cleans by <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>.</p>
