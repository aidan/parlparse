	Armoured Vehicle Training Service
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-15b.57.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="57"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050615/text/50615-27.htm#50615-27_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.57.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/2">I am announcing that the Ministry of Defence has decided to seek an alternative to the current private finance initiative (PFI) solution for the Armoured Vehicles Training Service (AVTS).</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/3">A detailed assessment of the Landmark Training Ltd consortium's bid has concluded that the PFI deal did not offer an acceptable value for money solution to meet the capability that the MoD required.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/4">I realise that this will be disappointing for the bidders. However, robust decisions need to be taken, and we will proceed with such a long-term commitment of public money only where we are confident of a successful, value for money outcome for our Armed Forces and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/5">Improvements to our armoured vehicles training will continue. This change in direction will allow us to examine other procurement options. We plan to take advantage of emerging technology and best practice as it develops in the commercial training areas, which could include public/private partnership forming part of the overall future solution. In the meantime, the quantity and quality of existing armoured vehicles training will be maintained to support the professional performance of our armoured fighting vehicle crews as exemplified in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/6">Although not continuing with this PFI, the MoD will continue to use PFI where it can be shown to deliver better value for money as exemplified by the recent PFI deal with the Amey Lec Consortium to provide C vehicles for the Armed Forces.</p>

	Civil Service: Fast Stream Recruitment Report
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-15b.58.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="58"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050615/text/50615-27.htm#50615-27_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.58.1/1">The 2004 fast stream recruitment report was published on-line at <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk">www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a> today. It covers the 2004 schemes covering the period April 2003 to November 2004, and reports the results of the fast stream competitions completed during that period, together with the developments that have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/2">The standard of entry to the fast stream recruitment scheme has remained consistently high and the report shows that the Civil Service has continued to have increasing success in filling its vacancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/3">Women applied in slightly reduced numbers during the 2004 scheme. However, in terms of their progress through the selection process female applicants were more successful than their male counterparts in the general fast stream and economist schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/4">The proportion of candidates from ethnic minority groups dropped from the previous year, down by 2.4 per cent. We have increased our marketing and outreach activities to this audience, the selection process has been updated and there is early indication of improved figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/5">The percentage of candidates declaring a disability rose again this year from 2.4 per cent in 2003 to 3.2 per cent in 2004. Those recommended for appointment rose from 3.5 per cent in 2003 to 7.3 per cent in 2004.</p>
