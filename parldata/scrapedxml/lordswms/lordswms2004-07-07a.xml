	International Court of Justice
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-07-07a.35.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="35"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040707/text/40707-35.htm#40707-35_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.35.1/1">The Government have amended the United Kingdom's declaration accepting the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice under Article 36(2) of the Statute of the Court. A copy of the revised declaration, set out in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-05">5 July 2004</phrase> to the United Nations Secretary-General, has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/2">The revised declaration makes two main changes to the former declaration dated <phrase class="date" code="1969-01-01">1 January 1969</phrase>. The first updates from <phrase class="date" code="1945-10-24">24 October 1945</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="1974-01-01">1 January 1974</phrase>, the cut-off date for the acceptance of the court's jurisdiction, thus excluding stale claims. The effect is that jurisdiction is not accepted in respect of disputes which arose before <phrase class="date" code="1974-01-01">1 January 1974</phrase>. The second is to broaden the scope of the previous Commonwealth exception, so that jurisdiction is not accepted in respect of any dispute with the government of any other country who are or have been a member of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth exception is of long standing and is retained by a number of Commonwealth countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3">Though these changes are of general application, their immediate significance is that they prevent any Commonwealth country from circumventing the present limitations by withdrawing from the Commonwealth and then instituting proceedings against the United Kingdom in respect of an existing dispute. The Government have acted to prevent such a move as they believe it is against the spirit of the existing Commonwealth exception.</p>

	Skills Strategy
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-07-07a.35.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="35"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040707/text/40707-35.htm#40707-35_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.35.3/1">My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Mr Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/2">In July 2003, the Government launched the National Skills Strategy, 21st Century Skills. The skills strategy is primarily a strategy for England, reflecting the devolution of responsibility for education and training to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/3">The strategy's aim is to ensure that employers have the right skills to support the success of their businesses, and individuals have the skills they need to be both employable and personally fulfilled. Significant progress has been made in the first year of the strategy, and today we are holding a key conference and the Skills Alliance is publishing a progress report to set out the successes to date and the challenges for the year ahead. There is now a real momentum for change and a strong sense of shared purpose and enthusiasm, and I would like to make you aware of the following achievements.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/4">The Skills Alliance has brought together key partners with an interest in skills and productivity&mdash;the Department for Education and Skills, the Department for Trade and Industry, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Treasury, the CBI, the TUC, the Small Business Council and the key delivery organisations led by the Learning and Skills Council. The Skills Alliance's role is to oversee effective implementation of the strategy and, today, has published its first annual report on progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/5">The skills strategy emphasised the need to move away from a supply-driven education and training system towards a demand-led approach. We are driving this forward by: improving our understanding of employers' skills needs and their contribution to raising productivity; working with employers to ensure that the skills of their employees are effectively deployed to support business development; and ensuring that skills demand drives the design of training programmes and qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/6">The <i>Success for All </i>reform strategy, launched in November 2002, has been a key factor in raising standards, improving quality, and ensuring that colleges and post-16 providers become more flexible and responsive to employers' needs. I am very pleased with the way in which the further education sector is embracing these reforms and that standards and responsiveness are improving.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/7">During the year, colleges and other training providers have successfully continued to expand the existing flow of people with skills, training and qualifications, thus meeting the needs so far of individuals and of employers, including: basic skills&mdash;200,000 learners achieved at least one skills-for-life qualification this year. Since 2001, 2.3 million learners have taken up 4.6 million skills-for-life learning opportunities. Level 2&mdash;260,000 more adults in the workforce achieved qualifications at least to full level 21 at the end of 2003 compared to autumn 2002. The proportion of adults in the workforce qualified to level 2 is now 71 per cent2. Apprenticeships&mdash;246,000 16&ndash;24 year-olds were enrolled by the end of March 2004. There have been over 1 million entrants to the programme so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/8">Foundation degrees&mdash;currently 24,500 students are enrolled on foundation degree courses, with employers involved in both the design and delivery. Overall flow of qualifications&mdash;nearly 3 million qualifications were achieved by adults in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/9">Other progress on the key areas within the strategy includes: for employers&mdash;there are over 60,000 employees on ETP through 10,000 employers, 18 sector skills councils, better business support, in particular for SMEs, and new apprenticeship family launched.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/10">For individuals&mdash;over 2,200 low skilled individuals benefiting from financial help with adult learning grant pilots, we are about to begin phased introduction of new level 2 entitlement in package of support in NE and SE, fewer adults without a full level 2, better IAG all over the country with reformed service standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/11">On qualifications&mdash;the work on reform of qualification system for adults will be set out at the Skills Strategy One Year On event, the Tomlinson proposals for 14&ndash;19, and new qualifications to meet employer need. With colleges and training providers&mdash;we continue to build on Success for All reform, strategic area reviews underway, new LSC business cycle, plan led funding, upwards trend in college success rates, and we are about to consult on reform of fees and funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/12">Through partnerships&mdash;new Skills Alliance and regional skills partnerships, NEP report to drive welfare to workforce development agenda including through New Deal for skills, Government leading by example and addressing skills issues in all departments/bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/13">These achievements represent significant progress during the year. We have been heartened by the widespread support that the strategy has received, the recognition that we have to get the implementation right if we are to achieve our national economic and social objectives, and the determination shown by organisations and individuals across the board to play their full part.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/14">However, there is much more to do, and it will require sustained commitment over a period of years to address the deep-seated barriers to skills investment, and so achieve our economic and social goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/15">Copies of the <i>Skills Alliance: Skills Strategy Progress Report</i>;<i> Skills Strategy Progress Report Technical Supplement On Underlying Data and Evidence</i>;<i> Government Meeting Its Responsibilities</i>; and the <i>Skills for Life Annual Review 2003&ndash;2004</i> have been placed in the Library and are available in the Vote and Printed Paper Offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/16" class="indent">1 A full level 2 refers to any qualification equivalent in standard and breadth to 5 GCSEs at A*&ndash;C or a national Vocational Qualification at level 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/17" class="indent">2 Labour Force Survey, Winter 2003&ndash;04</p>

	<p pid="a.38.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/2">With my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, I am pleased to inform the House that the UK remains number one in Europe for inward investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/3">UK Trade and Investment announced today, at its launch of the UK Inward Investment 2003&ndash;04 report, that there were 811 direct investments in the UK by foreign-owned companies between <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>. This is an increase of 14 per cent on the year before and confirms the UK's position as the top investment location in Europe. Total jobs figures were up 8 per cent to 59,217 of which 25,463 were new jobs (down 26 per cent on the previous year) and 33,754 were safeguarded jobs (up 41 per cent on 2002&ndash;03).</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/4">This performance reflects the confidence, which companies around the world continue to show in the business climate in the UK. The number of new projects has increased by 8 per cent from 314 in 2002&ndash;03 to 339 in 2003&ndash;04, while expansions by existing investors increased by 18 per cent from 234 in 2002&ndash;03 to 285 in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/5">The competition is fierce. But we will not allow our position as market leader in Europe to make us complacent. UKTI will further strengthen and sharpen its operations in priority markets and the Government will continue to ensure that the UK provides economic growth and stability and an innovative climate to attract investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.3/6">I am arranging for a copy of the UK Inward Investment 2003&ndash;04 report to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
