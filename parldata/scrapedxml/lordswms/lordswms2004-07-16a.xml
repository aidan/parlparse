	Commonhold

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-07-16a.69.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040716/text/40716-15.htm#40716-17_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.69.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">14 July</phrase> I made the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (Commencement No. 4) Order 2004. The order will bring into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-27">27 September 2004</phrase> the whole of the remainder of Part 1 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 except for Section 21(4) and (5).</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/3">I have today also laid before each House the Commonhold Regulations 2004 and the Commonhold (Land Registration) Rules 2004 with, in each case, an explanatory memorandum, which includes a regulatory impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/4">The combined effect of these instruments is that as from <phrase class="date" code="">27 September</phrase> commonhold will be available in England and Wales as a new way of owning interdependent freehold properties, such as blocks of flats. It combines the security of freehold ownership with a robust standard legal framework for the management of common facilities. It will be an alternative to long leasehold ownership and will be equally available for residential and commercial property.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/5">The implementation of commonhold fulfils a manifesto commitment made in 2001 and will increase housing choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/6">To accompany the Commonhold Regulations my department has published non-statutory guidance. I have placed copies in the Libraries of both Houses. It is intended that the Land Registry Practice Guide in connection with the Commonhold (Land Registration) Rules will be published in the near future following the making of a fee order for commonhold applications. Copies of the regulations and the non-statutory guidance will be available on my department's website and copies of the rules will be available on Land Registry's website.</p>

	e-Conveyancing
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-07-16a.69.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040716/text/40716-15.htm#40716-17_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.69.3/1">Since the publication of the e-conveyancing consultation report last year, Land Registry has continued to work closely with stakeholders, including potential service providers, to determine the structure of e-conveyancing services in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/2">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Mr David Lammy) has recently approved a report by Land Registry on its recommended way forward and copies of a document entitled <i>Defining the Service</i> have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. While this document describes the e-conveyancing services to be delivered, it should be noted that these are the subject of ongoing consultation with stakeholders and may be subject to future revision. The e-conveyancing service will comprise three main components:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/3">A central e-conveyancing service controlled by Land Registry;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/4">An accompanying electronic funds transfer service to be supplied by an agent bank (or banks); and</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/5">Service delivery channels provided largely by the private sector, but including a Land Registry channel.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/6">The proposed structure has been agreed by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State who has asked Land Registry to continue work to develop these three services. In the design and build of the central e-conveyancing service and the Land Registry channel, the department will procure the assistance of an IT strategic supplier.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/7">Land Registry will procure an agent bank (or banks) to support the electronic funds transfer service.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/8">Land Registry will consider the options for the future fee structure for its e-conveyancing and paper services and report back to my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Mr David Lammy) on this by the end of 2004.</p>
