<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-03-23a.33.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="33"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50323-39.htm#50323-39_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.33.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-14">14 July 2004</phrase>, in her statement to the House (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 1253), my noble friend Lady Amos announced that the Government accepted the conclusions of Lord Butler's review. In my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-15">15 November 2004</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>WS 29</i>), I said that Sir David Omand, the Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator, would lead the work on implementation of those conclusions. Sir David Omand has now completed this work and I should like to report the outcome to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/2">A considerable amount has been done in a short time by Sir David, the heads of the security and intelligence agencies and senior officials in government departments to implement the conclusions. The detail is set out in a report (Cm 6492) that the Foreign Secretary is today laying before the House. Copies will also be placed in the Library of the House. A number of key actions have already been taken:</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/3" class="indent">Secret Intelligence Service has developed new procedures, provided additional resources and revised line management arrangements to improve evaluation and to oversee the quality of intelligence reporting. Work has taken place to ensure that source descriptions in intelligence reports across the intelligence community use standardised terminology and are consistent;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/4" class="indent">arrangements have been put in place across the community to ensure that the distribution of sensitive reporting can be extended when necessary;</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/5" class="indent">Joint Intelligence Committee processes have been reviewed and tightened up. Arrangements have been made so that in future the annual process to set the requirements and priorities for the collection and analysis of intelligence will apply to the defence intelligence staff as well as to the three statutory agencies. A confidential guide for readers of intelligence, including information on the limitations of intelligence, has been produced and distributed; and</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/6" class="indent">access to the agencies' staff counsellor has been agreed for members of the assessments staff and fully analogous arrangements have been put in place for members of the defence intelligence staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/7">Further work is in hand to improve the analytical support provided to the intelligence community following a study carried out by a senior Foreign Office official. That study has recommended and the Government have endorsed:</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/8" class="indent">the establishment of a professional head of intelligence analysis to advise in the security, defence and foreign affairs fields on analytical capability and methodology: recruitment and career management of analysts; and the development and oversight of more substantial training of analysts; and</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/9" class="indent">the expansion of the assessments staff, by about one-third. This will provide additional internal review and challenge functions for Joint Intelligence Committee assessments; resource work on countries at risk of instability; and allow increased production of regular warning papers highlighting significant threats or other issues likely to face the Government in the near to medium term in the fields of security, defence and foreign affairs. Other small increases to make the assessments staff more effective are also recommended.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/10">Sir David Omand's successor as Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator has been asked to give high priority to implementing these measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/11">In addition to the publication of the detailed report on the implementation of the conclusions of the Butler review, the Cabinet Office is publishing today an updated national intelligence machinery booklet. Copies of this are also being placed in the Library of the House. It is also on the Cabinet Office website at <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk">www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>. This booklet sets out the roles, responsibility and organisation of the UK intelligence community and reflects the changes made as a result of the Butler review. It also includes an unclassified version of the guide for readers of intelligence that has been circulated within government.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/12">Lord Butler's review has contributed greatly to the process under way to fit the UK's intelligence community for the future. The Government recognised the need to move substantially to implement its conclusions and have done so.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.1/1">Today the Government will publish their report <i>Establishing an Inspectorate for Justice and Community Safety.</i> Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/2">The proposals for consultation outlined in the report aim to introduce root and branch reform, changing the structure of inspection in the criminal justice system and enhancing the capacity for leadership and decision-making.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/3">Independent inspection in the criminal justice system plays an important role in improving services and holding organisations to account for their performance. In recent years every criminal justice agency has undergone reform to deliver improvements to services; it is essential that the inspection regime is reformed to support these changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/4">The five justice inspectorates have done an excellent job in driving up performance. Therefore the Government propose to build on the current base of expertise and create an inspectorate for justice and community safety that continues the rigorous independent inspection of criminal justice agencies, including the treatment and conditions of those in custody, while broadening this to inspect across organisational boundaries to deliver a more joined-up inspection system. An inspection regime that inspects the criminal justice process from end to end supports the front line by reducing unnecessary burden and bureaucracy and examines how the system can better deliver for those who come into contact with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/5">The government welcome views on the precise design of the new inspectorate before <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>.</p>
