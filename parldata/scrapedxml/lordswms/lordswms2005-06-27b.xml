	Houses of Parliament: Visitor Reception Building and Westminster Hall
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-27b.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100067" speakername="Lord Brabazon of Tara" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050627/text/50627-34.htm#50627-34_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.1.1/1">In July last year the House agreed to the report of the House Committee which endorsed the recommendations in the joint report from the Accommodation and Works and Administration Committees in the Commons for a new visitor reception building, to be sited at the north-west corner of Westminster Hall.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/2">Over the past 12 months work on design has progressed and the domestic committees of both Houses have been consulted. Tenders will be invited in August 2005 and construction is due to begin on site in December 2005. It is planned to complete the work by the time of the return of both Houses in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/3">A model of the new visitor reception building will be exhibited in the Upper Waiting Hall from <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July</phrase>, in the atrium of Portcullis House from 4 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-08">8 July</phrase>, and in the Royal Gallery from 11 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-15">15 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/4">The construction of the new building will involve some disruption to Westminster Hall as well as the facilities on the west side of the hall. To avoid such disruption being spread over a number of years, the opportunity is being taken to carry out a number of maintenance and repair projects in Westminster Hall itself, including replacement of the guttering and repairs to the south stairs and floor. As a result, Westminster Hall, the Commons Grand Committee Room, the Jubilee Cafe, the Jubilee Room, the meeting rooms off Westminster Hall and the IPU and CPA offices and reception rooms will be inaccessible from the end of December 2005 until October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/5">Most of the disruption will affect Members of the Commons, and the Serjeant at Arms is therefore co-ordinating the provision of alternative meeting and reception rooms. Members of this House may wish to note, however, that the UK branch of the CPA will be moved to temporary offices in 2 The Abbey Garden, and sittings of the House of Commons in Westminster Hall will be held in Committee Room 10, with effect from January 2006 until the return of the House of Commons in October 2006.</p>
