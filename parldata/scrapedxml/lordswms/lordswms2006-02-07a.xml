	House of Lords: Travel
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-02-07a.41.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100067" speakername="Lord Brabazon of Tara" colon=":" colnum="41"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60207-47.htm#60207-48_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.41.1/1">The House Committee agreed in May 2004 to the setting up of a pilot scheme to provide a credit card for Members to use to purchase tickets for official parliamentary travel. Twenty members participated in the pilot and feedback has been positive. Under the scheme the Finance Department settles statements direct and reconciles them with Members' attendance claims as they are received. Members are also required to verify card statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">The House Committee has agreed that the use of the card should now be offered to all Members from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>, and this will be done on a rolling basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/3">Use of the card will be subject to certain conditions. These will be based on the following principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/4" class="indent">the card may be used only for official ticketed parliamentary travel as set out in the general guide to the Members' expenses scheme;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/5" class="indent">Members using the card must verify and return card statements to the Finance Department within one month of their issue indicating journey details, purposes and dates;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/6" class="indent">the Finance Department will set the monthly authorisation limit in discussion with each Member based on travel patterns;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/7" class="indent">Members must report the loss of any card immediately on its discovery both to the card issuer and to the Finance Department; and</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/8" class="indent">the card would be withdrawn from Members who failed to comply with the rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/9">Use of the card will be voluntary. However, from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, all claims for ticketed travel in excess of &pound;100 will need to be supported by vouchers unless a travel card is used.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/10">Further details of the scheme will be circulated to Members by the Finance Department. The Finance Department will subsequently contact Members to offer the use of the card.</p>
