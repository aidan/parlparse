	<p pid="b.112.3/1">In a Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">Thursday 10 February 2005</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-02-10.46"><i>Official Report</i>, col. WS 46</phrase>) it was announced that the previous annual Cabinet Office publication <i>Public Bodies </i>had been replaced by an online searchable database. I am pleased to announce that the 2005 update of the database has now been completed. Data on individual public bodies as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> were made available online during the summer, and the package has now been completed with the provision of summary reports and a printable (pdf) file of all the 2005 data. The database is accessible at <a href="http://www.knowledgenetwork.gov.uk/ndpb/ndpb.nsf">www.knowledgenetwork.gov.uk/ndpb/ndpb.nsf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.3/2">The database lists the public bodies sponsored by central government, with contact details, information about their remit and about the membership of their boards. The figures are broken down between male and female members for individual bodies, and summaries are provided at departmental level for the proportions of board members who are women, have declared they have a disability or come from a minority ethnic background.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.3/3">Comparisons with 2004 database returns show that diversity levels have remained broadly similar. There has been a small increase in the proportion of appointees who have declared they have a disability, but a slight decrease in the percentage of appointments held by women and by people from minority ethnic backgrounds. This reinforces the Government's commitment to continue to pursue their diversity objectives and to promote outreach activity and plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.3/4">The database also includes information about the Government's task forces, ad-hoc advisory groups and reviews, giving a more complete picture of the bodies and groups working to deliver the Government's objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.3/5">Copies of a printed version of the pdf file are available in the Library.</p>
