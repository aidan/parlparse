	Global Opportunities Fund: Annual Report
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-12-20a.103.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="103"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo041220/text/41220-33.htm#41220-33_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.103.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Jack Straw) will today lay before Parliament the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Annual Report on the Global Opportunities Fund (GOF) 2003&ndash;04. This is the first such report which covers the financial year (FY) 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/2">Copies will be placed in the Library of the House. Additional copies can also be obtained from the Printed Paper Office. A copy will also be available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website: <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/gof">http://www.fco.gov.uk/gof</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/3">The Foreign Secretary launched the GOF in May 2003 to focus the FCO's programme spending more closely on our priorities; and to bring greater professionalism to our programme and project management work. It has made an impressive start. This report provides an overview of the GOF programmes and describes project activity. It also contains a section on lessons learned and a forward look to the current FY.</p>

	Anti-terrorism Laws: Law Lords' Judgment
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-12-20a.103.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="103"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo041220/text/41220-33.htm#41220-33_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.103.3/1">This House has today handed down the judgment in this difficult and complex case. A committee of nine Law Lords has spent the last 11 weeks considering the issues and, within the short time available since the judgment was handed down, it is not possible to give a detailed response to all the points raised by the judgment. However, given its importance I believe it necessary to make this Statement to the House as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/2">This appeal is about the compatibility of our domestic law with the ECHR. The Law Lords have upheld the appeal by those detained under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act and we need to study the judgment carefully, not least because the Court of Appeal had unanimously endorsed our view that these provisions were compatible with our obligations under the ECHR. It is ultimately for Parliament to decide whether and how we should amend the law. The Part 4 provisions will remain in force until Parliament agrees the future of the law. Accordingly my right honourable friend, the Home Secretary, will not be revoking the certificates or releasing the detainees, whom we have reason to believe are a significant threat to our security, a judgment upheld by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, chaired by a High Court judge.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/3">The primary role of my right honourable friend as Home Secretary is to protect national security and to ensure the safety and security of this country. In doing so, he needs to consider how we balance the rights of individuals against those of society; how we ensure safety and security within a democracy without undermining the values that are at the very heart of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/4">Derogation is not something that any Government enters into lightly and the powers have been used sparingly as promised Parliament during the passage of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/5">To date 16 individuals have been certified and detained under the Part 4 powers and another individual has been certified but is currently detained under other powers. Of these 12 remain in detention. Two have chosen to leave the country as those detained under the Part 4 powers are free to do at any time. Those certified have a right of appeal to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) which is a superior court of record, chaired by a High Court judge.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/6">Those who have been certified and detained under the Part 4 powers are detained because they have been certified as a threat to our security. This considered assessment is supported by the Security Service and has been tested through a superior court of record with full access to all the relevant security and intelligence information.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/7">The need for the Part 4 powers and the derogation are kept under frequent review. In addition to regular threat assessments, the Home Secretary regularly meets the Director General of the Security Service, and it is their advice that informs the Home Secretary's decision on the continuing public emergency threatening the life of the nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/8">The Home Secretary will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the new year, but in the mean time we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House.</p>

	Criminal Trials

	<p pid="a.104.1/1">The report setting out my conclusions on the issue whether in principle prosecutors should be able to interview witnesses in criminal trials has been published today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">In reaching those conclusions I have been informed by the results of a public consultation, conducted on my behalf by the Crown Prosecution Service, and by the views expressed to me by senior members of the judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">In England and Wales prosecutors are not entitled to interview witnesses before trial, even when they are key witnesses whose credibility may be critical to whether a prosecution should go ahead or not. If my vision of the CPS as a world-class prosecuting service, admired and respected, and seen by all as a champion for victims and justice is to be realised, this must change.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">The public rightly expects prosecutors to prosecute criminal offences, robustly, promptly and fairly and to bring to trial only those against whom there is an adequate and properly prepared case (and whose prosecution is justified in the public interest) and that prosecutors have confidence in the reliability of the evidence. Logic dictates that this expectation can only be met if prosecutors are able to interview witnesses about their evidence before trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/5">I have therefore concluded, for the reasons set out in the report, that the position ought to change so that prosecutors should have the ability in the future to interview witnesses, subject to safeguards including a code of practice and appropriate training.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/6">I believe that the changes recommended will strengthen the prosecution process and contribute to putting victims and witnesses at the heart of criminal justice and more at ease with the criminal justice process.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/7">The Director of Public Prosecutions fully supports the conclusions that I have reached. The report sets out my proposals for implementation of these conclusions through a working group to consider best how to pilot these proposals and further discussions with the professional bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/8">I am grateful to all those who contributed their time and expertise by responding to the consultation paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.1/2">In accordance with undertakings in its Race Equality Scheme, the Ministry of Defence has produced a second progress report, a copy of which is being placed today in the Library of the House. The report builds on and relates back to the first report, issued in January 2004, and describes the progress made across the department and by the Armed Forces. It emphasises our determination to maintain the standards we have achieved to date and to continue to review our policies and procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">Our record for managing and retaining ethnic minority personnel is good. The outcome of staff attitude surveys and the low level of race-related complaints indicate a continuing improvement in the race equality climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">However, there is still much more work to do as the report acknowledges. The Ministry of Defence is committed to meeting the aspirations set out in the Race Equality Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.3/2">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council met on 6 and <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>. Items on the agenda relating to health were covered on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>. Items for discussion were: a co-ordinated approach to combat HIV/AIDS in the European Union and its neighbourhood; European Commission proposals for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on medicinal products for paediatric use; and the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods. I represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.3/3">Ministers welcomed the European Commission's approach, as set out in its working paper <i>A Co-ordinated Approach to Combat HIV/AIDS in the EU and its Neighbourhood</i>, but agreed that further work would be needed at all levels. The UK called on the European Commission to provide a clearer picture of where EU resources were currently targeted on HIV/AIDS and an analysis of how effective these investments had been. The UK stressed the need for the EU to work closely with the Global Fund. The UK also stressed its commitment to working with member states to develop a vaccine following the announcement in the UK on World AIDS Day (<phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>) on exploring the use of advance purchase agreements to create the right financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to invest in research.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.3/4">The Council discussed, for the first time, the European Commission proposed regulation on paediatric medicines. The European Commission presented the proposal, setting out the principal objective of improving the health of the children of Europe by increasing the development of medicines for use in children. The UK did not intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.3/5">The Council had its first discussion of the Commission's proposal to harmonise rules for labelling foodstuffs with health and nutrition claims. The Council's exchange of views was structured around presidency questions focused on the key issue of nutrient profiles, the proposed method of determining whether claims should be allowed. The UK's position was that the impact on business had to be proportionate to the objectives, and that full stakeholder consultations on the details of implementation would be needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.3/6">Ministers adopted Council conclusions on a European response to emerging zoonotic diseases without any discussion.</p>

	Northern Ireland: Priorities and Budget 2005&ndash;08
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-12-20a.106.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="106"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo041220/text/41220-34.htm#41220-34_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.106.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/2">Following consultation on the Government's Draft Priorities and Budget for Northern Ireland which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-12">12 October 2004</phrase>, I am today setting out the Government's priorities and spending plans for the Northern Ireland departments for the period 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/3">When devolution was suspended in Northern Ireland we pledged that we would work tirelessly to bring about an early restoration of devolved government. We have and will continue to strive to bring this about so that the issues and plans set out in the priorities and budget can become the responsibility of Ministers accountable to a Northern Ireland Assembly. However, until then we are determined to continue to deliver on our plans to address the challenges facing Northern Ireland and ensure the delivery of better public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/4">The resources underlying these priorities and budget proposals were largely determined by the outcome of the national spending review 2004 (SR 2004), as announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-12">12 July 2004</phrase>. These resources have been supplemented by forecast local rates revenue and the use of the borrowing power available under the reinvestment and reform initiative over the next three years. This is a substantial allocation and provides for continuing real growth in public expenditure by Northern Ireland departments, reaching in excess of &pound;9 billion by 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/5">The priorities and budget which we are publishing today sets out the Government's priorities for Northern Ireland and how we plan to use the resources available to us to pursue these over the next three years. In reaching final decisions on resource allocations my ministerial colleagues and I have listened carefully to the issues raised and concerns expressed during the consultation of the draft proposals, and where it has been possible we have taken action to address these concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/6">These plans will continue to build on the progress made by the former Northern Ireland executive under devolution and continued by the Northern Ireland ministerial team since devolution was suspended. Our vision for the future of Northern Ireland is for a peaceful, inclusive, prosperous, stable and fair society, firmly founded on the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust and the protection and vindication of human rights for all. Our key objective therefore is to develop a strong economy and a society that is fair for all. In pursuing this objective we must ensure that all available resources are used to the best possible effect. That is why this budget will ensure that investment is matched with reform, and steps will be taken to improve public sector performance and efficiency, ensuring that increased resources have maximum impact on the delivery of key front line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/7">The three key themes and associated objectives underpinning these plans are:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/8">Economic competitiveness&mdash;to make Northern Ireland a more competitive and productive region.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/9">Building equality and community cohesion&mdash;to increase opportunity for all and ensure stronger communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/10">Better public services&mdash;to ensure excellent and efficient public services for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/11">In order to meet these objectives we have set ourselves targets across a number of important priority areas, where the proposed outcomes are intended to deliver the changes needed to ensure the achievement of our vision for Northern Ireland. The ministerial team will concentrate on these targets, monitoring them closely to ensure that they improve policy making and provide better public services for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/12">For economic competitiveness, we have set targets of reducing the productivity gap with the rest of the UK; increasing the proportion of the working age population who are economically active; and by July 2007 opening up the electricity market to all consumers. These and other actions will help generate the conditions to enable the economy to become more competitive at national and international levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/13">We want to encourage increased expenditure on research and development, to optimise the exploitation of Northern Ireland's world-class telecommunications structure and achieve a competitive, sustainable and reliable energy market to improve competitiveness and stimulate enterprise. Through Invest NI we will provide support for companies to become more competitive through the development of their capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/14">We also recognise the importance of workforce skills as a driver for economic change and growth. Increasing productivity and competitiveness, improving public services and addressing social disadvantage will all require a substantial increase in the overall skills of the workforce. One of our top priorities, therefore, is to improve the level of skills and qualifications in Northern Ireland, and we will do this by reforming key elements of the vocational education and training system.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/15">In building equality and community cohesion, we are committed to building on our strong legislative and public policy frameworks to progress our goal of a more equal and inclusive society with strong, cohesive communities in which differences are accepted, respected and celebrated. We will continue to ensure that equality considerations are mainstreamed into policy development. Through promoting social inclusion (PSI) initiatives we will continue to support joint working across departments, in partnership with statutory agencies and voluntary and community organisations to promote a more inclusive society.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/16">Tackling poverty and disadvantage remain key priorities and we will build on New Targeting Social Need by bringing forward a new anti-poverty strategy. We want to combat poverty by supporting people to move from welfare to work and increase benefit uptake through targeting vulnerable groups. We are also determined to reduce the number of households living in poverty through co-ordinated policy and action across the social security, health and education sectors. Through the implementation of the neighbourhood renewal strategy we aim to narrow the gap between those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest of Northern Ireland. Support for victims and survivors remains a priority and as Northern Ireland emerges from conflict it is important that we pay particular attention to the citizens of tomorrow. To this end, a 10-year strategy for children and young people will be taken forward and we will continue to support the Office of the Commissioner for Children and Young People.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/17">Investment in health remains a top priority for the Government in Northern Ireland. The budget provides for a rise of 23 per cent in current spending on health over the next three years. This will enable investment in priority services such as renal, cancer and other critical care areas and will provide for enhancement to community, primary and intermediate care services, services for the elderly and those with mental illnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/18">We need to ensure that the major increases in funding for the health and social care sectors that have taken place since 1997 are used to deliver the best possible care and treatment, and improve the overall health of the population. It is in this context that an independent review of health service delivery in Northern Ireland has been commissioned. The review will be led by Professor John Appleby of the King's Fund and will examine the effectiveness and efficiency of health service delivery. The review will report initial findings to Ministers in April 2005 with the final report scheduled for publication by summer 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/19">Current spending on education will increase by 11 per cent over the budget period and capital investment will increase by 6 per cent. A high quality education system remains a key priority for the Government and these expenditure allocations will allow us to take forward a programme of education reform that will change and improve substantially what children learn, how they learn, and the environment within which they learn. These reforms will produce significant benefits for children, for society and for the economy. They will also allow us to maintain a focus on improving literacy and numeracy standards, particularly among disadvantaged pupils, and continue to address the requirements of children with special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/20">The priorities and budget also provides for an unprecedented growth in capital investment in Northern Ireland's public service infrastructure, with levels of investment planned to grow to over &pound;1.2 billion a year in each of the next three years. The reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI), launched in May 2002, remains a key enabler of the major improvements required to Northern Ireland's infrastructure, particularly in the major public services of health, education, roads, public transport, water and sewerage. The Strategic Investment Board was established in 2003 to help drive forward the reinvestment and reform initiative by improving expertise in procurement and spearhead the development of public/private partnerships. Major investment programmes do of course take several years to deliver which means we need to plan several years ahead to ensure we allocate investment funds effectively. That is why the Strategic Investment Board has drawn up a longer term 10-year draft investment strategy for Northern Ireland which is also being published today for consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/21">In seeking to deliver better public services a key focus of these plans is on efficiency and the reallocation of resources released through efficiency improvements to priority front line services. These plans include targets for the public sector to deliver efficiency gains of 2.5 per cent each year over the next three years, at least half of which will release resources for reallocation to priority front line services. As a part of this, the administration costs of civil service departments are being held flat at 2005&ndash;06 levels over the next three years and civil service numbers will reduce by 2,300 across all departments. We also plan shortly to publish proposals flowing from the review of public administration with a view to reaching final decisions in the summer of 2005 and implementation by 2008&ndash;09. The review will contribute to the more effective delivery of public services and efficiency savings arising from its implementation will be in addition to those in current plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/22">This priorities and budget builds on the substantial real growth in public expenditure that has occurred in recent years and will continue for the next three years. From 2002&ndash;03 to the end of this budget period expenditure by Northern Ireland departments will have grown by a third in cash terms&mdash;or by 20 per cent in real terms. Infrastructure investment is planned to grow by 30 per cent next year alone, and this extra investment will be sustained in the years after that. The challenge now is to deliver the better services and modern infrastructure that people want and Northern Ireland needs to enhance its competitiveness and to build a fairer society.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/23">I have placed copies of the <i>Northern Ireland Priorities and Budget 2005&ndash;08</i> document in the Library.</p>
