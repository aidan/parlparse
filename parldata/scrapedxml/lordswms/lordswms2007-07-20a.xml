	Housing: Home Information Packs
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-07-20a.41.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="41"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70720-wms0001.htm#07072055000004">
	<p pid="a.41.1/1">Following the motion to revoke the Home Information Pack (No. 2) Regulations 2007, the Government are placing their response on record.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">A number of debates have taken place over the past year about home information packs (HIPs). The Merits Committee of the House has reported twice on HIPs regulations. Throughout the parliamentary process, the Government have listened carefully to the arguments put forward and have adapted our plans for the introduction of HIPs in response to many of the comments made. We have also engaged in long and constructive dialogue with key stakeholders from the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/3">In response to the arguments put forward by Baroness Hanham, Baroness Scott, and Earl Caithness, the Government have made it clear that we remain committed to HIPs, linked with energy performance certificates (EPCs), as a first step in reforming and improving the home-buying process, which is currently wasteful, stressful and opaque. We believe that the process needs to be more transparent and predictable, particularly for first-time buyers and that all consumers need to be able to rely on having key information before they commit to home purchase rather than later in the process. These arguments were supported in debate by Lord Elystan-Morgan, Lord Graham of Edmonton and Lord Redesdale, who also drew attention to the importance of energy performance certificates.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/4">We also believe that the urgency of climate change and the need for consumers to have more information about reducing energy use and energy bills means that introducing EPCs as part of the HIP will achieve this swiftly and reliably.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/5">In recent months and since the regulations were withdrawn on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase>, everything has been done to ensure a smooth introduction of HIPs and EPCs on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-01">1 August</phrase>. Our implementation plans, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June</phrase>, have been followed through. There are enough inspectors; the infrastructure is ready; the industry is prepared; and consumers are anticipating the change. There is no reason to delay any further. We will therefore introduce HIPs for the sale of homes with four or more bedrooms on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-01">1 August</phrase>, and we will roll them out for the remainder of the market as announced. We are confident that they will act as a catalyst for reform of the wider home buying and selling process and make a considerable contribution to cutting carbon emissions. We will, of course, continue to work with stakeholders to make further progress on those agendas.</p>
