	<p pid="a.3.5/3">The National Policing Plan sets out the Government's vision of a police service which puts the law-abiding citizen at the heart of all it does, while working in partnership to create and maintain safe, secure and confident communities. This will require the creation of a culture for policing which can tackle crime successfully from the local to the national and international level. The National Policing Plan will inform local planning and help to ensure that all communities know what they should expect from their local police force. It builds on the commitments for police reform set out in <i>Building Communities, Beating Crime: a better police service for the 21st century</i> published on <phrase class="date" code="">9 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.5/4">The National Policing Plan 2005&ndash;08 is available on the web at <a href="http://www.policereform.gov.uk">www.policereform.gov.uk</a>.</p>
