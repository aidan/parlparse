	<p pid="a.67.1/3" class="italic">WTO/DDA</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">The European Commission updated the council on the state of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations and underlined that it was aiming to secure an outcome in line with the mandate provided by member states. The council confirmed its support for the Commission in this, and emphasised the importance of achieving a balanced outcome to the negotiations as a whole, including therefore non-agricultural market access and trade in services, as well as agriculture. The council welcomed the Commission's commitment to strengthen the mechanisms for keeping the council fully informed of developments in the negotiations. Council conclusions were agreed which reflected these points.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/5" class="italic">Avian Flu</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/6">The European Commission, Romania and Greece updated the council on developments of reported avian flu and the measures they had taken. The presidency noted the various measures already being taken to deal with the issue, and that the council would return to it on a number of occasions during the UK presidency. The council concluded that it would pull together all these measures into a comprehensive action plan. Council conclusions were agreed which reflected these points.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/7" class="italic">South Asian Earthquake and Central American Tropical Storm Assistance</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/8">The presidency expressed shock at the scale of the recent South Asian earthquake and reiterated its solidarity and sympathy with those affected. The presidency called for an urgent EU response both politically and in humanitarian assistance and made a personal plea for member states to provide as much assistance in kind as soon as possible. The European Commission highlighted that the Community Mechanism (MIC) had become operational the day after the South Asian earthquake with ECHO committing &euro;3.6 million immediately with a further pledge of &euro;10 million. The European Commission informed the council that they were urgently looking at further funding for rehabilitation and reconstruction in the region. On tropical storm Stan, the Commission had been equally rapid in its response having given &euro;1.7 million to El Salvador and a further &euro;3 million for Guatemala. The presidency agreed to discuss the EU's response to crises at the 21&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase> GAERC.</p>
