	<p pid="a.43.1/1">The interdepartmental review of international human rights instruments announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-07">7 March 2002</phrase> by my noble and learned friend Lord Irvine of Lairg has been concluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/2">In the course of the review, the Government have ratified the optional protocol to the United Nations Convention Against Torture; signed and ratified Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights; ratified the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, relating to children in armed conflict; and extended the European Convention on Human Rights to the Cyprus Sovereign Base Area. We have decided to accept the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, which will help us to assess the effects of individual petition to the UN generally. By accepting the protocol we are also confirming the United Kingdom's commitment to women and equality issues, spearheaded by the Minister for Women, Patricia Hewitt. We will also sign Protocol 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights; ratify Chapters A and B of the Convention on Participation of Foreigners in Public Life; withdraw the general reservation relating to immigration entered under the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women; and modify the reservation relating to the Throne and the Armed Forces entered under the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women. Finally we will dispense with a group of reservations now obsolete.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.1/1">I announced in January a review of cases of parents and carers convicted of killing an infant under the age of two in the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/2">This followed the Court of Appeal's decision to quash the conviction of Angela Cannings. The court's judgment questioned the safety of convictions depending exclusively, or almost exclusively, on a serious disagreement between distinguished and reputable experts.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/3">In May, I announced that my office had notified the legal representatives of five defendants that it may be appropriate for the safety of their clients' convictions to be considered further by the Court of Appeal or, if appropriate, the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Since that time, as part of the process of ongoing review, my office has written in similar terms to the legal representatives of 19 further defendants.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/4">The fact that a case has been referred to legal representatives of the convicted person does not amount to a positive determination that their conviction is unsafe. Should any appeals result from this review, it will be for the Crown Prosecution Service to independently decide whether to contest the appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/5">I aim to complete the review in September, when I will report fully to the House. The review is continuing to be accorded the highest priority, to bring to an end this period of uncertainty for all those involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.1/1">Enhanced statistical information on strategic export licensing will, from July 2004, be released on a quarterly basis, instead of once a year through the annual report on strategic export controls, as at present. The first quarterly report on strategic export controls will be published on the Department of Trade and Industry and Foreign and Commonwealth Office websites (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk">www.dti.gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>) on <phrase class="date" code="">28 July</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.45.1/2">From now on, statistical data will be published on the FCO and DTI websites three months after the last decision in any given quarter. Until now, decisions taken in one calendar year have been reported in the annual report on strategic export controls in the middle of the following year. Information on the earliest licensing decisions reported in the annual report was not therefore made available until some 18 months later.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">From 2004, the annual report, which the Government have a statutory obligation to produce, will summarise information already provided in quarterly reports, as well as describing export control policy developments. It will be produced in hard and electronic copy. The hard copy will include a CD-ROM containing all of the licensing data published in the quarterly reports for that year. The Government intend to publish the next quarterly report, relating to decisions taken between April and June 2004, in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4">The introduction of quarterly reports reflects the Government's commitment to further improve the openness of their strategic export licensing system, which is already acknowledged to be among the most transparent in the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.2/1">Russian citizens Boris Abramovich Berezovsky and Akhmed Iliasovich Zakayev were granted asylum in the UK last year, as is public knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/2">The grant of asylum to these two persons was made after due assessment by the relevant authorities of their cases and of the UK's obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees and domestic law. They did not enter the UK at the invitation of Her Majesty's Government. A grant of asylum does not imply support from the UK Government for an individual's views, activities or statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.2/3">We take very seriously the requirement for any person granted asylum in the UK to comply with the conditions of the UN convention under which refugees are recognised, and with the provisions of UK law. Recipients of asylum receive cautions not to take part in criminal activities, or activities such as support for or encouragement of terrorist organisations, or activities endangering national security or public order. Where individuals granted asylum breach these conditions we would not hesitate to take action against them and have strengthened the law to enable us to do so more effectively.</p>

	Pre-trial Cross-examination: Visual Recordings
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-07-22a.47.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040722/text/40722-26.htm#40722-26_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.47.3/1">The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (the 1999 Act) contained, among other provisions, eight special measures for vulnerable or intimidated witnesses. They are essentially different ways of giving evidence in criminal trials which were designed either to improve the quality of evidence given by witnesses through reducing their levels of stress or to make it possible for witnesses who find difficulty in giving their evidence to have access to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/2">This Government have already implemented, or are piloting, seven of the eight measures. The eighth measure&mdash;visually recorded pre-trial cross-examination&mdash;was always going to be the most complicated of the measures to implement. It was also always likely to be applied to the smallest number of cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/3">A number of stakeholders have expressed their concerns to us about the detail of its implementation. We therefore commissioned Professor Diane Birch, a leading academic in the field, to review and provide advice on the workability of visually recorded pre-trial cross-examination. A copy of Professor Birch's report has been laid in the Library today.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/4">The report concludes that one of the two main reasons for undertaking visually recorded pre-trial cross-examination&mdash;that of capturing all the witness's evidence early in the pre-trial process&mdash;is no longer valid. That is because of new rules on disclosure which effectively mean that by the time both counsel are in a position to undertake visually recorded pre-trial cross-examination, they will be ready to go ahead with the trial itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/5">The second reason&mdash;keeping the witness out of court altogether&mdash;is still valid. However the report concludes that rather than introduce the cumbersome mechanism of visually recorded pre-trial cross-examination many months after having visually recorded evidence in chief, it would be far more sensible to return to the original recommendation in the report of the advisory group on video evidence (1989) chaired by his Honour Judge Thomas Pigot QC. This was that the child should appear at an informal hearing, at which both the child's evidence in chief (supplemented, where there was one, by an earlier video recorded interview) and the cross-examination would be recorded on video for subsequent transmission to the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/6">The report recommends that Section 28 of the 1999 Act, which provides for visually recorded pre-trial cross-examination, should be revisited. It recommends also that the operation of Section 21 of the same Act should be reviewed. Section 21 provides that under-17 year-olds who are witnesses in cases of sex or violence are given no choice in having certain special measures&mdash;such as visually recorded evidence in chief or live TV links&mdash;applied to them, whether they wish for them or not. So a 16&frac12; year-old who has witnessed any sort of violent crime, even where he was not himself involved, would be forced to give evidence in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/7">The Government are disappointed not to be implementing one of the eight special measures for vulnerable or intimidated witnesses which we provided for in good faith five years ago. But we believe it is better to take the advice of one of the leading experts in the field and many senior practitioners, and revisit this complex issue. Our aim is to achieve genuine improvements to the way in which vulnerable and intimidated witnesses give their evidence, and this will not be achieved by ploughing on doggedly with implementation of provisions which informed advice suggests will not be practicable or yield the benefits originally envisaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/8">We have therefore decided that in the autumn we shall embark upon a wider review of how child evidence is taken and presented in the criminal courts, particularly in cases involving sex or violence, with the aim of delivering the greater flexibility recommended in Professor Birch's report. This will assist in our aim of enabling measures to be more tailored to the individual witness's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.3/9">We are also ensuring that everything which can be done to improve the experience of those witnesses who might have benefited from the implementation of Section 28 is being done. The No Witness No Justice project will ensure that children's needs are assessed and met, so that, for example, pre-trial court visits are arranged; access to a range of emotional support and guidance through appropriate groups is offered; where possible home visits take place; and parents are provided with a single point of contact to access information and advice throughout the case. We will continue to improve court buildings so that encounters between the defendant and the child witness are minimised, for example though providing more TV live links. We will also continue to work with the judiciary and the Bar to ensure that children's needs and wishes are recognised by the courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.1/1">My right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/2">In my statement of <phrase class="date" code="">19 May</phrase> I said that I would report further stages in establishing the plan for switchover. I am pleased to say that much progress has been made in the discussions between the Government, Ofcom and the public service broadcasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/3">While the broadcasters have not reached a full consensus on the optimum timetable, some&mdash;including the BBC&mdash;have suggested that 2012 may be the most appropriate date for the completion of switchover. This could mean beginning the switching sequence as early as 2007. This would be subject to agreement on a detailed plan, including resolution of the remaining issues raised in the discussions. Ofcom plans to include reference to this timetable in the draft digital licences for Channels 3, 4, 5 and Teletext which they expect to publish for consultation later this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/4">We continue to believe that an ordered process leading to the earliest practicable switchover remains desirable given the advantages to consumers, the broadcasting industry and future growth of innovative new services. We believe that switchover should be broadcaster-led but that the final decision on timetable should balance these benefits against the need to ensure that the interests of the most vulnerable consumers are protected. I have therefore asked Ofcom's independent consumer panel to consider what measures might be necessary to ensure this protection and to report to me later this year with their advice. We will also take advice from leading charities. The Government's final endorsement of a timetable will be subject to being satisfied that adequate measures are in place to meet this objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/5">The BBC, in its <phrase class="date" code="">29 June</phrase> publication <i>Building Public Value</i>, proposed that 2012 should be the target date for switchover. The BBC made clear its willingness to be a &quot;leader and co-ordinator across the industry&quot; and to &quot;take a special responsibility for bringing the final cohorts into the digital television universe&quot;. I have asked the BBC how it proposes to take this forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/6">The Government remain committed to ensuring that switchover is planned and implemented in a way which is platform and broadcaster neutral. Consumers must have clear, unbiased information about what is available on each platform and from each provider so that they can make an informed choice. In particular, people who buy television equipment now should know that switchover will take place during the expected lifetime of television sets bought today. We are therefore engaged with retailers and manufacturers&mdash;who also need to plan ahead&mdash;to see that good clear information is given to consumers currently planning to buy a television or an item of recording equipment. We expect this information to spread through retail outlets from September, identified by the switchover logo.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/7">As an early step towards switchover, we are proceeding with a technical trial in two villages&mdash;Ferryside and Llansteffan&mdash;in south Wales. The residents have responded overwhelmingly in favour of taking part in this trial. If, as we expect, this switchover trial is successful, this community will be the first in the UK to go fully digital next spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/8">We expect further progress on these matters in the coming months and I will report to the House on material developments as they occur.</p>

This will enable the Ombudsman to conduct a full investigation into Equitable Life. The amendment to the legislation to make this change will be made as soon as possible.</p>
