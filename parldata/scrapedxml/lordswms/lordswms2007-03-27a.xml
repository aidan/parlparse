	<p pid="a.113.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Derek Twigg) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/2">Over the past 12 months the Ministry of Defence has undertaken a thorough review of the Defence Medical Services (DMS) manpower requirement.The aim of this review was to determine the number of uniformed, regular DMS personnel required to support operations consistent with overall defence planning assumptions, provide full healthcare and allow for continued training and the provision of headquarters staff during deployment. The review has now been completed and I am now in a position to inform the House of the new DMS manpower requirement. I am convinced it provides a credible baseline on which the DMS can base its planning and ensure that the excellent level of healthcare which it provides both on operations and, in collaboration with the NHS, in the UK, is sustained into the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/3">The last full review of the DMS uniformedregular manpower requirement took place at the time of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) more than eight years ago, and produced a requirement for a grand total of 8,970 posts (the SDR total). This, however, exceeded the available medical manpower and subsequent experience in support of deployed operations showed that a different balance of medical specialisms was more appropriate. Hence a lower overall figure was adopted as a pragmatic interim basis for funding a different mix of established posts (the established liability). To ensure that the requirement was valid not just in the light of emerging practice on operations since SDR, but also to be consistent with current defence-wide planning assumptions, a formal review was undertaken, starting in January 2006.The review was carried out by the multi-disciplinary Medical Operational Capability (Med Op Cap) project team, drawing on previous studies, lessons learntwork, high-level operational analysis and incorporating military judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/4">The overall result of this work is that the DMS baseline uniformed regular manning requirement(the Med Op Cap requirement) has now been set at 7,573 posts plus an additional manning and training margin of 678, making a grand total of 8,251 posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/5">This compares to the previous established liability of 7,741 posts plus a manning and training margin of 543, making a grand total of 8,284 posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/6">The SDR grand total of 8,970 posts did not separately specify within it a manning and training margin.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/7">As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, the uniformed regular manning was 6,497 (namely, the number of peoplewe actually have rather than the number of posts required).</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/8">There are also some significant changes within individual medical cadres between the SDR andthe Med Op Cap requirement, with some cadres increasing and some decreasing. Some additional potential for civilianisation of up to 320 posts in the Med Op Cap total requirement was identified by the review, which will be investigated further.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/9">I shall place full details of the new requirements against individual cadres in the Library of the House. It is a necessarily complex package, but one which provides an essential building-block for the DMS to focus its efforts on addressing the most critical shortfalls.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/10">The impact of the new requirement on the individual career paths for personnel in the Royal Navy, Army and RAF Medical Services will besmall. The review has validated the existing policyof maximising capability from staffing our field hospitals on a collaborative tri-service basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/11">The Government are committed to ensuring that the DMS continues to be sufficiently flexible to respond to future operational challenges. The recent review of the DMS uniformed regular manpower requirement is a necessary and positive step to achieving this.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (John Hutton) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/2">Today I am publishing <I>Working for Children</I>(Cm 7067) which includes our response to recommendations made in the report <I>Delivering on Child Poverty: what would it take</I>? by Lisa Harker in November 2006. It is only one element of a cross-governmental child poverty strategy and sets out the additional measures the DWP will take to maximise its contribution to the ambitious targets of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/3">Building on the announcements made in the Budget to take a further 200,000 children out of poverty by increasing tax credits and wider support for parents, <I>Working for Children</I> refocuses &pound;150 million of resources within the Department for Work and Pensions towards greater support for families.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/4">Measures include:</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/5">piloting a New Deal for Families approach so more families get access to support that is often available only for lone parents. To do this we will extend support available in the New Deal for Lone Parents Plus pilot areas to all families with children in those areas;extending the New Deal for Lone Parents Plus scheme to help more lone parents benefit fromthis service and signalling initial support ahead of a period of consultation for recommendations from David Freud to increase obligations on lone parents with older children to look for work;providing more support to families, particularly in London where employment rates lag, including widening and improving the in-work credit scheme which provides additional financial support for lone parents as they make the transition to work;changing Jobcentre Plus systems so parents are properly identified in the benefit system for the first time and record the childcare needs and preferences of all parents&mdash;not just lone parents as at present; andproviding advice and support for the partners of parents claiming jobseeker's allowance, with the introduction of mandatory six-monthly work-focused interviews for this group.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/6">We have made significant progress by lifting 600,000 children out of relative poverty since the Prime Minister set the historic target in 1998 to eradicate child poverty by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/7">Our success in helping people into work hasbeen key to reducing child poverty. We have seen2.5 million more people in work than in 1997 and there are now more than one million lone parentsin employment. We need to continue to build on this success but recognise there is more to do if we are to reach our goal.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/8">Copies of the report are available from the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/2">In my Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-19">19 March</phrase>, (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-03-19.557"><I>Official Report</I>, col. 557-8</phrase>) I set out the background to the review of the new national recruitment and selection process for doctors in postgraduate training. I outlined the decisions that had been made by the review group up to that date. As the review group continued to meet last week, the purpose of this Statement is to provide a further update on progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/3">The review group issued a further statement on<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-22">22 March</phrase>. This said:</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/4">Building on last week's announcement, at a minimum, every long-listable applicant who applied through Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) and meets the eligibility criteria for their relevant specialty will be invited for an interview. Under this guaranteed interview scheme, candidates will be able to choose which of their preferences to be interviewed for in light of geographic specialty-specific and specialty training level-specific competition ratios which will be available on the MTAS website. We are in discussion about the implications of this for the timetable.The recruitment system has worked satisfactorily for general practice and this will continue. In other specialities, there is evidence that the short-listing process was weak and we will therefore eliminate this part of the process immediately. In contrast, the interview process has been working and therefore the revised approach will ensure that all long-listable candidates will be interviewed. The review group believes that this new approach is the most equitable and practical solution available. The group also recognises the enormous effort by the consultants, service and deans that has already taken place to ensure that the interview process has worked. The time and effort required for further interviews is recognised by the service and the time required will be made available. Therefore first choice interviews that have already taken place should not need to be repeated.In accordance with the advice already issued, we reiterate that all interviews will be informed by the use of CVs and portfolios and probing questions.In broad terms, this means that all eligible applicants at every stage of their training, whether or not they have already had interviews or interview offers, will be able to review their stated first choice preference and have the opportunityto select the one for which they want to be interviewed. We will be discussing operational details over the next week and these may differ between specialties and between different partsof the UK dependent on local circumstances. We will also consult widely. Exact details of how applicants will be able to do this will be available week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April</phrase> on the MMC website at <a href="http://www.mmc.nhs.uk">www.mmc.nhs.uk</a>. In the mean time, interviews will continue and applicants should attend unless they are confident that this will not be their preferred choice.No job offers will be made until all these interviews have taken place. Discussions are taking place on the implications of this for the filling of general practice training places. We expect that the majority of training places will be filled through these interviews. Unfilled vacancies will be filled through further interviews.The review group has recommended the development of a programme of career support for applicants at all stages of the process. Further details to support applicants, deans and selectors through this process will be available next week on the MMC website. Future work will explore what the possibilities might be for doctors to change specialties.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/5">This represents a reasonable way forward to meet both the aspirations of junior doctors and the timetable for making appointments for August. I therefore regret the fact that the British Medical Association representatives have withdrawn from the group. Despite this, the important work of the review group will continue and I would encourage the British Medical Association representatives to come back to the table to ensure that all stakeholders can work together to take forward a workable solution to these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/6">I am glad to note that the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges supports this revised approach. It believes that with the work of the review group it offers the most equitable and practical solution available.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/7">The timetable for the group's work is very tight and the next two weeks will see important progress. Applicants, consultants, employers and all those with a stake in the process will be anxious to be kept informed of progress. I trust that the House will understand if we continue to issue updates on important developments during the recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/8">As ever, I am very grateful to Professor Douglas and his colleagues for their continuing work on the review group. We will publish the group's final report once it is completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/2">I am pleased to announce the local authorities that have been chosen to pilot a sanction of housing benefit linked to anti-social behaviour. The sanction, contained in the Welfare Reform Bill (Clause 31), is part of the Respect programme and would apply where a household has been evicted for anti-social behaviour and subsequently refuses to engage with rehabilitation services offered. It will give local authorities an additional tool for tackling anti-social behaviour in order to achieve a culture of self-respect, respect for others and respect for community.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/3">The intention is to pilot the scheme for a period of two years (subject to the Bill receiving Royal Assent) in the following local authorities:</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/4">Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council;Blackpool Borough Council;Dover District Council;Manchester City Council;New Forest District Council;Newham London Borough Council;South Gloucestershire Council; and</p>

	<p pid="a.124.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>, during the debate on Iraq, in response to a question by my noble friend Lady Gould of Potternewton, I said: &quot;The review of the constitution is due to end on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-15">15 May 2007</phrase>, and I assure my noble friend that the removal of Article 41 indeed remains one of our objectives&quot; (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-05-15.1260"><I>Official Report</I>, col. 1260</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.124.3/2">I should have said that the Constitutional Review Committee, which was formed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November 2006</phrase>, is due to present its proposed amendments for the Council of Representative's consideration by mid May 2007, and that while there is no stipulated time frame for the whole review process, Iraq's political party leaders have committed to completing the constitutional review process, including the required referendum, within a year of the review committee forming. We are making clear to the Government of Iraq that Article 41 must be implemented in a way that does not contravene the various human rights provisions in the Iraqi constitution. I apologise to my noble friend and to the House for this inadvertent error.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.3/3">We are also supporting Iraqi women's groups with concerns about the impact of the constitution&mdash;helping them make their voices heard. We will continue to press the Government of Iraq about the important role of women in society and to develop policies and laws in line with the constitution which states that all people should be treated equally irrespective of gender, race or ethnicity.</p>
