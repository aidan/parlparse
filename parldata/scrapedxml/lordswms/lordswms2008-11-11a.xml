	<p pid="a.39.3/3">I am pleased to announce to the House that today we have agreed the establishment of a new monitoring panel on business lending. This panel, made up of senior government officials from HM Treasury and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and representatives of the Bank of England, will monitor and enter into a constructive dialogue with individual lenders on the availability, risk and overall cost of lending to small and medium-sized businesses from the five major banks<sup>2</sup>. These banks have agreed to provide, in strictest confidence, data on the availability, risk and overall cost of lending to the monitoring panel.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Phil Hope) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/2">The Government's response to the consultation on reform of discrimination law, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-21">21 July 2008</phrase>, gave a commitment that the Government would make a Statement after the parliamentary recess setting out a defined programme of work to tackle age discrimination in the health and social care sectors and to help service providers prepare for legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/3">This programme of work will address age equality issues in health and social care. It will inform the implementation of the Equality Bill, planned for next Session, which, subject to parliamentary approval, will ban harmful discrimination on grounds of age against people aged 18 and over, and will also consider non-legislative measures to tackle age discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/4">The work will be underpinned by the following principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/5">age discrimination and unfair treatment based on age have no place in a fair society, which values all its members;personalisation means that individuals' needs for health and social care should be on the basis of their individual condition and circumstances, not general assumptions about their age;services should be differentiated by age only where this is objectively justifiable; andservices for all people should be subject to achieving overall value for money in the use of public funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/6">We plan to take the following action:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/7">we shall seek views of stakeholders, including professions and service commissioners and providers via the departmental National Stakeholder Forum, the Social Partnership and the Third Sector Sounding Board, by running a learning event by the end of November 2008. This will raise awareness with a view to setting up an advisory group shortly afterwards;we shall establish an advisory group, to include key stakeholders with an interest in using, providing or commissioning services, training those who provide care, and monitoring action on age equality. The group will have a remit to produce advice to the Government, which is to include:identifying where age discrimination may occur in health and social care; setting parameters for obtaining evidence of current policies, practice and service organisation which does or may result in age discrimination;consideration of possible exceptions to a ban on unjustifiable age discrimination;consideration of what action the department and others may need to take to remove unjustifiable age discrimination in the provision, organisation and experience of health and social care; andconsideration of costs, risks and benefits of differentiation of services for different age groups, to inform a compulsory impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/8">Departmental officials will support the advisory group, which will be extended and supported by:</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/9">a reference group of interested organisations and networks to get widest input and debate;sub-groups for specific areas; for instance, mental health and social care could start work on implementation plans in advance of other areas of healthcare for which evidence is not yet available; anda technical analysts' sub-group that will give advice on evidence gathering and analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/10">We will publish a summary of the group's discussions and any advice it produces on the department's website and will encourage wider participation in its discussions through stakeholder engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/11">We expect that the advisory group's work will take 18 months to complete. It will start in December 2008. An early task will be to establish provisional milestones for the phases of work, including on the key services and sectors. Emerging evidence from the work will be used as it becomes available to inform the ongoing development of policy and priorities on the provision and commissioning of health and social care, and this will contribute to discussion on action to address age equality in health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/12">The advisory group will draw on existing departmental stakeholder networks, and new ones, such as National Voices, as they become available.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/13">The Government will undertake consultation on possible exceptions to the ban on harmful age discrimination&mdash;in health and social care&mdash;taking account of the findings of the advisory group when it has completed its work.</p>

	Immigration: Points-based System
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-11-11a.41.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="41"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81111-wms0001.htm#81111-wms0001.htm_spmin6">
	<p pid="a.41.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration (Phil Woolas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">Throughout this year, the Government have been delivering the biggest shake-up of the immigration system for a generation. We are delivering a stronger border that maximises the use of new technology, a selective Australian-style points system to control migration and a clear expectation that newcomers earn the right to stay.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/3">Already this year, we have made sweeping changes to our border protection, including checking fingerprints before we issue a visa, screening all travellers against watch-lists and introducing a single border force with police-like powers. Last week we laid Immigration Rules making a number of changes, including implementing the skilled and temporary worker tiers of the points-based system (PBS), to simplify the route for business visitors, and to increase the minimum age for obtaining a marriage visa from 18 to 21.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/4">The Government are making an unprecedented investment in skills and training to ensure that UK residents do not lose out to overseas workers or see jobs go abroad because of a lack of skills. We have recently made a number of funding agreements with employers, worth &pound;630 million over three years, to give them greater access to flexible, bespoke training aimed at tackling skills shortages in their sectors. These agreements cover sectors such as catering and hospitality, the nuclear industry and construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/5">A fundamental part of the skilled worker tier of the points-based system is the shortage occupation lists, for the United Kingdom and Scotland. These are skilled occupations where the Government consider there are shortages so that it is sensible for vacancies to be filled by migrant workers from outside the European economic area. Migrant workers seeking to come to work in the UK score points if they are applying to work in one of these occupations.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/6">In setting these lists I have carefully considered the advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which reported to Government on this matter in September. I am very grateful to the MAC for its independent advice. The lists are shown below.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/2"><I>Healthy Weight, Healthy L</I><I>iving,</I> published in January 2008, announced a social marketing campaign of &pound;75 million over three years. It now has the committed support of a range of partners, from industry to local grassroots organisations. This is the first coalition of its kind to be brought together by the Government to tackle the growing problem of obesity.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/3">Change4Life is a lifestyle revolution which will help families eat well, move more and live longer. Under the banner Change4Life, the Government are aiming to galvanise support from everyone in the country, from grassroots organisations to leading supermarkets and charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/4">Before Change4Life was created, the department undertook detailed research to test what messages would work with families. That research is published today and shows that:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/5">parents do not recognise that their children are overweight&mdash;just 11.5 per cent of parents with overweight or obese children recognise it;parents underestimate how much unhealthy food and convenience food they buy as well as overestimating the amount of activity their children do; only 38 per cent of adults know that obesity can lead to heart disease and only 6 per cent know about the link of cancer with being overweight;many families use snacks as rewards, as fillers during times of boredom and to appease conflict;parents of older children are more worried about not feeding them enough and the risk of eating disorders such as anorexia; andlack of knowledge, confidence and skills is the main barrier which stops parents cooking from scratch.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/6">These statistics are a convincing evidence base for the campaign. They demonstrate the need for a change in people's lifestyles, and Change4Life aims to provide the information to enable families to make healthier informed choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/7">The brand of Change4Life has now been unveiled, and the first partner organisations have revealed their pledges, which set out what they plan to do to help people make healthier choices in their lives. In addition to commercial partners, 12,400 local activists have signed up and many more have pledged their support. The pledges of commercial partners are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/8"><I>T</I><I>esco</I></p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/9">Tesco stores serve 20 million customers per week and employ more than 250,000 people. The organisation is committed to spreading the word on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle among its customers and workforce.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/10">Tesco will also run themed Change4Life promotional activity (Change4Life for Less) in-store on healthier products, and its customer magazine, which reaches 5 million customers, will include features on the campaign and tips to help customers get healthier.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/11">Tesco will support the campaign with a range of other initiatives. Its store-based community champions, staff members dedicated to understanding and linking up with the communities around its stores, will support the project with activities tailored to their own communities, ranging from stalls in-store to tell customers about the campaign, to visits to schools.</p>
