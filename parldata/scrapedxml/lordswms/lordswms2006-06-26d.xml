	<p pid="d.53.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="d.53.1/2">I am today putting in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of the Government's response to the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group's report <i>The Other Side of the Coin: The UK and Corruption in Africa</i>.</p>

	Legal Services: Complaints
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-26d.53.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060626/text/60626-25.htm#60626-25_spmin1">
	<p pid="d.53.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May</phrase> this year, the Government published their Legal Services Bill. The draft Bill is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee chaired by Lord Hunt of Wirral. It develops proposals set out in our White Paper <i>The Future of Legal Services: Putting Consumers First</i> and it will put consumers at the heart of a new framework for the regulation and delivery of legal services.</p>
	<p pid="d.53.3/2">One of the core components of the draft Bill is the proposal to establish a single, independent complaints-handling body, the Office for Legal Complaints. The OLC will deal with all consumer complaints about regulated legal services providers. Our aim in establishing it is to simplify the current arrangements for the handling of complaints, increase the accountability and transparency of the complaints-handling system, improve the way in which complaints are handled and increase consumer confidence.</p>
	<p pid="d.53.3/3">The Government are aware that the creation of the OLC will have a significant impact on staff working in organisations within the existing framework and it is in an effort to relieve staff uncertainty that I would like to announce that the Government's preferred option for the location of the proposed OLC is the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="d.53.3/4">This announcement relates only to the area of the country in which the OLC will be located. Further work will be needed to identify a specific site, but Leamington Spa will not be considered. This is to ensure that the OLC will be a new organisation independent of the existing framework and can take advantage of a larger local labour market and the benefits associated with moving to a new site.</p>
	<p pid="d.53.3/5">This announcement will not pre-empt the parliamentary process, but is being made on the basis that this is the Government's preferred option subject to the report of the Joint Committee and any subsequent legislation which may be taken forward.</p>
