	Administration and Enforcement Restriction Orders
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-01-21b.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80121-wms0001.htm#08012120000007">
	<p pid="b.1.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/2">In response to an undertaking given to the Commons committee considering the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCEA) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-16">16 January</phrase>, I published the consultation paper <I>Administration and Enforcement Restriction Orders: Setting the Parameters</I>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/3">This is a formal consultation exercise undertaken by Her Majesty's Courts Service to seek views on the secondary legislation required to establish the constraints and limits that will set out the parameters of the administration and enforcement restriction order schemes introduced in the TCEA 2007. The administration order scheme is reformed, and the enforcement restriction order introduced, by the Act. Both are part of a package of measures designed to improve and extend the range of options available to assist the over-indebted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/4">The consultation document includes proposals covering debts that could be excluded from the schemes, the definition of debts that may be exempt from restrictions on legal action and the proposed total debt limit on administration orders. The consultation document also includes proposals covering the minimum amount of surplus income (the difference between income from all sources and allowed justifiable expenditure) and the amount of money debtors should be able to pay before they are permitted to enter the administration order scheme. It also seeks views on how often debtors should update information on financial circumstances as well as the amount of notice that should be given before assets above a fixed value are disposed of.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.1/5">Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are also available on the internet at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/cp0108.pdf">www.justice.gov.uk/docs/cp0108.pdf</a>. I will make a further Statement regarding the response shortly after the consultation period ends.</p>

	Research and Science Budget: Physics Review

	<p pid="b.3.1/1">Today my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills (John Denham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/2">Today I am publishing the terms of reference for the review of physics I asked Research Councils UK (RCUK) to commission as part of the science budget allocations announced on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase>. I have placed copies in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/3">The <I>Science and Innovation Investment Framework 2004-14</I> sets out the Government's commitment to nurturing key disciplines. The research councils, funding councils, and national academies have made significant progress. It is important that all key disciplines remain strong and vibrant. Research priorities will change over time, and in line with the Haldane principle it is for research councils to set these, but it is important that the Government are confident that the combined decisions of the research councils properly underpin the health of key disciplines. This is important both for the future of research and, more widely, to ensure a flow of talented individuals into science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects at university.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/4">As a next step, I asked Ian Diamond, as chair of RCUK, to organise a series of reviews on the health of key research disciplines in the UK. I announced that the first of these reviews would be on physics, and would be led by Professor Bill Wakeham, vice-chancellor, the University of Southampton.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/5">I am pleased to announce that RCUK has now agreed terms of reference for the review. These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/6">RCUK will, as part of its continuing oversight of health of disciplines, commission a cross-council review of actions that might be taken to ensure the continued health of physics research and postgraduate training in the UK, as the first in a series of such reviews.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/7">The review will:</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/8">consider the priorities for investment across physics as a whole, taking account of the need both to maintain the health of discipline and to strengthen its wider, including economic, impact in the future;identify the contribution physics makes to other areas of research and explore how these contributions can be enhanced, with a view to strengthening the health of the UK research base as a whole;identify options for strengthening research leadership and enhancing the opportunities in physics for young researchers;with resources coming from more than one funding organisation, examine ways to improve the coherence of the UK physics programme;examine the provision of physics-based facilities, their application across the science base, and appropriate means of sustaining their operation; andcomment on any other issues that have implications for the health of physics in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/9">The review will make recommendations that will inform the medium-term funding of physics across the science base. It will report to RCUK during 2008. RCUK will then submit specific recommendations to the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. The names of the other members of the review will be announced shortly.</p>
