	Common Agricultural Policy Reform: Northern Ireland
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-02-10a.45.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="45"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040210/text/40210-28.htm#40210-28_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.45.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Agriculture in Northern Ireland has made the following Statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland launched a major consultation exercise in September 2003 covering the choice of the main implementation options arising out of the CAP reform agreement reached in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-26">26 June 2003</phrase>. The consultation ended on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-16">16 January 2004</phrase> and after having considered stakeholder responses and the relative merits of the available choices, I have decided to deploy the following options in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">Full decoupling of direct producer support will be implemented across the beef, sheep and arable sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4">Full decoupling of direct producer support will be introduced in the diary sector from 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/5">The model of decoupling used will be a static vertical hybrid based partly on eligible land held in 2005 and partly on past patterns of individual producer subsidy claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/6">National envelopes will not be deployed at this point.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/7">Decisions on the use of the additional rural development regulation options are deferred and will be considered as part of a separate consultation exercise on future modulation policy scheduled to commence in March 2004.</p>

	Community Radio

	<p pid="a.45.3/1">My right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/2">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has today published a draft Community Radio Order, associated Keeling Schedule and Explanatory Memorandum for public consultation. Copies of these documents are available in the House Libraries, or from the department's website. The department welcomes comments and the consultation period will last until <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-20">20 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/3">This order proposes to introduce a new tier of very local, not-for-profit (or not profit-distributing) radio. Community radio should be different from, and complementary to, existing independent local radio. Community radio offers potential benefits in terms of social inclusion, local educational, training and experience, wider access for communities to broadcasting opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/4">The Communications Act provides for the possible establishment of a fund to support community radio. Ofcom will shortly be publishing its own draft guidance on how to apply for community radio licences.</p>
