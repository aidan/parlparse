<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-03-29a.80.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="80"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-19.htm#60329-19_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.80.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.3/2">The Department for International Development (DfID) will launch its Disaster Risk Reduction Policy on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>. This policy provides a framework for DfID to integrate disaster risk reduction measures more effectively into its own work, as well as strengthening the international system's capacity to manage disaster risks, thus helping to reduce the threat that disasters pose to sustainable development and the millennium development goals (MDGs).</p>
	<p pid="a.80.3/3">DfID made a public commitment to reducing disaster risk in its 1997 White Paper <i>Eliminating World Poverty: A Challenge for the 21st Century</i> and has a good track record of providing prompt and appropriate humanitarian assistance in developing countries. DfID has also supported a number of international organisations in tackling disaster risk reduction, including UN agencies and the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent. However, in the wake of a series of large-scale disasters, including the 2004 Asian Tsunami, the 2005 Niger humanitarian crisis and the Pakistan earthquake, it is clear that both DfID and the international community must do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.3/4">In my speech on humanitarian reform in December 2004, I committed DfID to giving a higher priority to disaster risk reduction. DfID's new Disaster Risk Reduction Policy sets out how this commitment will be put into practice. The goal of the policy is to contribute to sustainable development by reducing the burden of disasters on the poor and most vulnerable. This is in line with DfID's efforts to meet the millennium development goals, all of which are affected by the impact of disasters. The policy will also support the international commitments agreed at the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, as articulated in the Hyogo framework for action.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.3/5">DfID's policy has three objectives. First, it aims to promote the more effective integration of disaster risk reduction into development and humanitarian policy and planning. This includes working with the governments of developing countries and the World Bank to consider how disaster risk reduction can be incorporated more effectively into national-level planning, including through integrating disaster risk reduction into a country's nationally owned poverty reduction strategy. DfID will also ensure that disaster risk concerns are incorporated into our own planning in disaster-prone countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.3/6">Secondly, DfID will aim to strengthen institutions, at both national and regional level, aimed at reducing risk in developing countries. DfID will work to ensure that governments have the right systems in place to manage disaster risk reduction. At the international level, DfID will work with other donors, the EU and UN to improve the international system and ensure that international commitments are put into action. DfID will work with the international financial institutions and other donors to increase the quantity of financing for disaster risk reduction and will increase our own funding, through the international system and bilaterally.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.3/7">Thirdly, DfID will help to reduce the vulnerability of the poor by building their resilience to disaster risk. This will include support to the community-level disaster reduction work of civil society organisations, such as the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent and non-governmental organisations, as well as supporting a better understanding of the private sector's role in risk reduction</p>

	<p pid="a.84.3/1">The Administration and Works Committee has agreed that once the Lord Chancellor ceases to be Speaker of the House he should leave most of his current accommodation. The committee has further agreed that the accommodation should be kept for the use of the House as a whole. Accordingly, the committee has decided that the accommodation should be used as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2" class="italic">Principal Floor</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/3">The large room currently occupied by the Permanent Secretary of the Department for Constitutional Affairs (the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery) will become the Lord Speaker's office.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/4">The two small adjacent rooms will provide office space for staff supporting the Lord Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/5">Lord Falconer of Thoroton will remain in his current room for as long as he remains Lord Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/6">The Waiting Room, Facilities Room and Kitchen will be for the use of the Lord Speaker and, for the time being, the Lord Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/7">The large room on the corner, currently occupied by the Lord Chancellor's staff, will become a Writing Room with refreshment facilities. This will enable the present Writing Room on the Committee Corridor to be converted into a much needed additional Committee Room this summer. The new Writing Room will be easily accessible as it is on the Principal Floor. Once Lord Falconer of Thoroton ceases to be Lord Chancellor, his office will become the Writing Room and the corner room will be used to provide a meeting room and refreshment facilities for Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/8" class="italic">Principal Mezzanine Floor</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/9">While he remains Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton will retain the three rooms occupied by the Purse Bearer and Train Bearer on the mezzanine floor for any of his staff who are required to be in the Palace to support him in his ministerial capacity, including for the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/10">The Mail Room will provide additional office accommodation for the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/11" class="italic">First Floor (the Lord Chancellor's Flat)</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/12">A study will be undertaken to consider the various options for the use of these rooms.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/13">The committee has agreed that some of the rooms will be available for official entertainment. Party groupings, the Cross-Benchers and individual Members will be able to bid for the use of these rooms for official parliamentary or charitable events. The Lord Speaker will control the diary for these rooms and will have priority in their use in order to entertain on behalf of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/14" class="italic">Second Floor</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/15">The Crown Office will remain in its present location.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.1/1">My right honourable fiend the Minister of State (Caroline Flint) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/2">Today I am publishing a report on the review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act public consultation. The consultation ran from <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-16">16 August</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-25">25 November 2005</phrase>. A total of 535 responses were received from a wide range of stakeholders and individuals. The report was produced for the Department of Health by People, Science and Policy Limited and comprises an independent summary of the arguments raised. Copies of the report, and the consultation responses have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/3">In addition, over the same time period as the public consultation, the Department of Health funded the Progress Educational Trust to host an online discussion forum with the aim of facilitating open public discussion on issues raised in the context of the review. A summary of the postings made has been produced and copies have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.3/2">I have today published a consultation paper which seeks views on proposed changes to the regulations governing on-road and off-road motor events, the Motor Vehicles (Competitions and Trials) Regulations 1969 (as amended) and the Motor Vehicles (Off Road Events) Regulations 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.3/3">We propose that making a single new set of regulations, which would replace the existing 1969 on-road and 1995 off-road regulations and their subsequent amendments. Most provisions of the existing regulations would not be changed, including the conditions that apply to the authorisation and conduct of events. However, we are proposing to make some changes to the procedures for authorising events. The proposed changes will be in respect of England only. Existing regulations would continue to apply in Wales and Scotland until the devolved administrations make their own new regulations. Northern Ireland already has separate legislation for on-road and off-road motor events, which are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.3/4">It is also proposed the fees charged to authorise on-road events should be raised to reflect current administration costs of providing the authorisation service. The fees were last changed in 1993 by the Motor Vehicles (Competition and Trials) (Amendment) Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993/2233).</p>
	<p pid="a.85.3/5">The details of these proposals are mentioned in the consultation paper. A partial regulatory impact assessment with costs and benefits is attached to the consultation paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.3/6">Copies of the consultation paper and the annexes have been placed in the Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">In my Written Ministerial Statements dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-14">14 December 2005</phrase>, I explained that I had agreed that proposals for the reconfiguration of strategic health authorities (SHAs), the reconfiguration of primary care trusts (PCTs) and the reconfiguration of NHS ambulance trusts were fit to go forward for consultation in the cause of improving services to patients. The objective has been to ensure that the consultation on PCTs covers the broadest and most appropriate range of options. This statement provides an update on progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/3">The proposals for the reconfiguration of SHAs and PCTs have been subject to a 14-week local consultation, which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March 2006</phrase>. Similarly, the proposals for the reconfiguration of NHS ambulance trusts have been subject to a 14-week consultation, which ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase>, led by SHAs on my behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/4">No decisions will be taken regarding the reconfiguration of SHAs, PCTs and NHS ambulance trusts before the results of the consultations have been considered and any recommendations reviewed. SHAs will submit reports on the consultations on SHA and NHS ambulance trust reconfiguration proposals to the Department of Health by <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-05">5 April 2006</phrase> and on PCT reconfiguration proposals to the department by <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/5">In previous Statements, I explained that an external panel had been established to advise Ministers on whether SHAs had adequately engaged local stakeholders as part of the consultations on SHA and PCT reconfiguration proposals and whether any recommendations for reconfiguration submitted by SHAs meet the criteria set out in <i>Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS</i>, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/6">I will announce decisions as soon as possible, which may be on different timetables for the different forms and levels of organisations. Our aim is for new SHAs and new NHS ambulance trusts to be established from <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase> and for new PCTs to be established from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">The chairman of the Robert Hamill inquiry, Sir Edwin Jowitt, wrote to the Permanent Secretary of the Northern Ireland Office on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-09">9 December</phrase> formally to request that I convert the statutory basis of the Robert Hamill inquiry to the Inquiries Act 2005, under Section 15 of that Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/3">I have very carefully considered the representations made by Sir Edwin Jowitt and the other representations I have received, and have sought to take all the relevant factors into account. My concern throughout has been to ensure that the Robert Hamill inquiry should be able to carry out its work both as fully and as effectively as possible. In light of this, and taking into account the case made for conversion by Sir Edwin Jowitt and all the representations I have received, I have decided to grant the request of the Robert Hamill inquiry to be converted to the Inquiries Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/4">Through this Statement, I am formally giving notice under Section 15 of the Inquiries Act to Sir Edwin Jowitt and the panel members that the Robert Hamill inquiry will become an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005. The date of conversion will be the date of this Statement, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March 2006</phrase>, and from this date the Robert Hamill inquiry will be held under the Inquiries Act 2005. Sir Edwin Jowitt will remain the chair of this inquiry and there will be no change to its terms of reference as announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-16">16 November 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/5">It remains the strong wish of both the Government and the Hamill inquiry that the full facts in relation to the death of Robert Hamill should be established and I am confident that the Inquiries Act will provide an effective framework for achieving this. I can assure the House that the Government will continue to co-operate fully with this independent inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Derek Twigg) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/2">My department is announcing today that it is approving a proposal for ports development in the south-east&mdash;following a public inquiry in 2004&mdash;for the new Bathside Bay container terminal at Harwich. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is today issuing a parallel letter in respect of the planning applications which, together with the consents I have been asked to give, would allow the development to proceed. We believe that this scheme will provide much needed container capacity in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/3">Ports play a vital role in supporting the national economy. The Government are committed to maintaining and enhancing that role through their broad approach to ports policy and to the decisions they take on individual ports applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/4">We are committed to sustainable distribution and this new project would play a large part in securing that aim. We understand at the same time that the new terminal will have a significant impact on the environment. This is why we have imposed controls on the development, to provide new road and rail infrastructure so that congestion does not increase; to provide compensatory habitats for wildlife displaced by the scheme; and to reduce other environmental impacts such as noise, pollution and the visual impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.3/1">My honouable friend the Solicitor General has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/2">Today the Government are issuing a consultation paper, <i>Convicting Rapists and Protecting Victims&mdash;Justice for Victims of Rape</i>, following a review of the law concerning rape.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/3">This paper sets out a range of proposals which aim to improve the outcome of rape cases through further strengthening the existing legal framework and improving our care for victims and witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/4">We want to ensure that stronger cases are presented to the courts, that witnesses are given greater assistance in providing their evidence and that courts hear evidence from experts that will better inform juries about the realities of rape and the psychological impact of sexual offences upon victims. Such evidence will address myths and stereotypes concerning how a victim might be expected to behave.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/5">We believe these proposals have the potential to make a positive difference and welcome views on them.
