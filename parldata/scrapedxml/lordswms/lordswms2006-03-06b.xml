	<p pid="b.47.3/1">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw) and Sir John Grant (UK Permanent Representative to the EU) represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-27">27 February 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/2">The agenda items were covered as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/3" class="italic">Preparation of the European Council, 23-<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/4">The presidency presented an annotated draft agenda for the 23-<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase> European Council meeting to be held in Brussels. The focus of the European Council will be its annual review of the strategy for growth and jobs set out at Lisbon in March 2000 and relaunched last year. The presidency hopes the European Council will identify a series of priority actions to be implemented by the end of 2007 to fulfil these commitments. These priority actions should form a good basis on which to implement the second cycle of the Lisbon strategy in spring 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/5">In a short discussion, Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy Commissioner Wallstrom welcomed the annotated draft agenda particularly the focus on economic and energy issues. Several member states intervened on the structure of the draft agenda and priority action points.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/6" class="italic">Financial Perspective: Inter-Institutional Agreement (IIA)</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/7">The presidency presented its paper on progress in negotiations with the European Parliament on a proposal for renewal of an agreement between the EU institutions on budgetary discipline and improvement of the EU's annual budgetary procedure.

If Belgrade's co-operation with the ICTY does not improve, the Commission would be obliged to disrupt SAA negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/12">CFSP High Representative Solana briefed the council on the efforts of his personal representative, Ambassador Mirolsav Lajcak, to forge consensus between government and opposition parties in Montenegro on the modalities for the proposed referendum on the future of the state union with Serbia. The council reaffirmed its support for the efforts of Ambassador Lajcak.</p>

The possibility of exemptions might also apply in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/17">The presidency took note of the concerns expressed. These will be taken into account in future negotiations with a view to the Justice and Home Affairs Council taking a decision on 27-<phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/18" class="italic">Iraq</p>

	<p pid="b.47.3/24" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/25">German Foreign Minister Steinmeier briefed partners on the latest developments on the nuclear file. CFSP High Representative Solana and External Relations Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner also briefed the council on their recent meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki which included discussion of the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue. The presidency agreed that Ministers should discuss Iran again following the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase> International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/26">The council adopted conclusions which regretted Iran's decision to withhold co-operation with the IAEA; deplored Iran's resumption of enrichment-related activities; reaffirmed the EU's commitment to a diplomatic solution and called on Iran to reconsider its position on its nuclear issues activities and other areas of concern in order to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the EU.
