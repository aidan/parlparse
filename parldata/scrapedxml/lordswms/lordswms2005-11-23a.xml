	Legal Profession: Diversity
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-23a.137.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="137"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51123-43.htm#51123-44_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.137.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" name="Bridget Prentice">My honourable friend the Minister for Legal Services in England and Wales (Bridget Prentice)</phrase> has today made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/2">I have today published a report aimed at increasing diversity in the legal profession. This report responds to the advice provided to the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor by the Legal Services Consultative Panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/3">While the Government recognise that significant improvements have been made in recent years, we consider that more action is necessary to ensure equality of opportunity for those entering, or already in the profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/4">The panel made 17 recommendations on how to address the difficulties faced by those entering into, or progressing within, the legal professions. The Government broadly accept these recommendations. The report sets out how we will take this forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/5">As a first step, I have written to a number of firms and chambers today asking them to publish the diversity information that they already collect on those working within their organisations. This will ensure openness and transparency. This should in turn lead to greater public confidence in the legal professions as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/6">Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
