	Northern Ireland Office: Change to DEL Funding for 2004&ndash;05
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-02-22a.49.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="49"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050222/text/50222-45.htm#50222-45_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.49.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">Subject to parliamentary approval the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) will be taking a 2004&ndash;05 spring Supplementary Estimate. The effect this will have is to increase the NIO's DEL by &pound;47,954,000 from &pound;1,236,190,000 to &pound;1,284,144,000. Within the DEL change, the impact on resource and capital is as set out in the following table.</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.49.1/5"> <td>Resource (&pound;'000s)</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>Capital (&pound;'000s)</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.49.1/10">The change in the resource element of the DEL by &pound;48,054,000 arises from the draw down of &pound;50,281,000 end-year flexibility and the surrender of PES transfers to other departments of &pound;2,227,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/11">The extra resource is primarily required to fund a non-budget pressure relating to the PSNI FTR severance provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/12">The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from the surrender of PES transfers to other departments of &pound;100,000.</p>

He also stated that he knew of no other citizens detained in similar circumstances elsewhere. That statement was clear and remains accurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/2">I would however like to bring to the attention of the House the cases of two British nationals being held as security internees by the coalition forces in Iraq. One is a British national being held by US forces at Camp Bucca, the other is a dual British/Iraqi national and is being held at Shaibah by UK forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/3">Both men are being held as security internees in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004). The International Committee of the Red Cross has access to both detention facilities and family visits are also permitted. Both internees' cases are reviewed regularly by the appropriate authorities.</p>

	Prison Service Pay Review Body
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-02-22a.56.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="56"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050222/text/50222-45.htm#50222-46_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.56.1/1">The fourth report of the Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) on the pay of in-charge governors and operational managers, prison officers and related grades in England and Wales in 2005 has been published today and copies placed in the Library. I would like to thank the chair and members of the PSPRB for their hard work in producing their recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/2">The PSPRB has recommended a 2.5 per cent basic increase to pay rates for prison officer and related grades and to in-charge governors and other operational managers. It has recommended a slightly higher increase of 3 per cent for senior officers to improve the pay differential for what they regard as an increasingly important operational grade. The basic award of 2.5 per cent is at the same level as the December 2004 figure for all-items inflation excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX). Most in-charge governors and other operational managers receive performance payments on top of their basic award, which contribute to earnings growth for them above the level of inflation. Just under half of all prison officers will also receive increments, adding to earnings growth for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/3">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has decided that the recommendations will be implemented in full, with effect from the operative date of the award of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. The cost of the award will be met from within the existing budget allocation for the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/4">There is now a pressing need to look, for the next pay round and beyond, at a multi-year settlement to give a framework for Modernisation. This will involve a comprehensive review of existing pay systems to support reform, which is essential to achieving the goals of a Modern service and in enabling it to operate in the new environment of contestability. We have therefore tasked officials to discuss urgently with the pay review body how this can best be achieved against the background, recognised by the review body, of continuing financial constraints. The Home Secretary expects to issue a remit letter to this effect in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/5">The key recommendations of the report are:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/6" class="indent">A 2.5 per cent basic increase to pay rates for prison officer and related grades and operational managers from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/7" class="indent">A 3 per cent basic increase for senior officers from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/8">An increase of 6 per cent to the maxima and minima of the pay scales for senior operational managers;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/9">No change to local pay allowance rates from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. These remain at:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/10" class="indent">&pound;4,000 per annum for the &quot;top&quot; rate (mainly London)</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/11" class="indent">&pound;3,100 per annum for the &quot;high&quot; rate</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/12" class="indent">&pound;2,600 per annum for the &quot;middle&quot; rate</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/13" class="indent">&pound;1,100 per annum for the &quot;lower&quot; rate</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/14">Required hours addition for operational managers to be increased by the basic award figure (2.5 per cent);</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/15">Healthcare specialist allowance increased by 2.5 per cent but all others frozen at current rates; and</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/16">All other allowances (tornado, bedwatch, on call, dirty protest, etc) increased by 2.5 per cent except for the care and maintenance of dogs allowance to be increased by 1 per cent.</p>
