	Northern Ireland Office: Change to DEL Funding for 2004&ndash;05

	<p pid="a.49.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">Subject to parliamentary approval the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) will be taking a 2004&ndash;05 spring Supplementary Estimate. The effect this will have is to increase the NIO's DEL by &pound;47,954,000 from &pound;1,236,190,000 to &pound;1,284,144,000. Within the DEL change, the impact on resource and capital is as set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.1/10">The change in the resource element of the DEL by &pound;48,054,000 arises from the draw down of &pound;50,281,000 end-year flexibility and the surrender of PES transfers to other departments of &pound;2,227,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/11">The extra resource is primarily required to fund a non-budget pressure relating to the PSNI FTR severance provision.</p>

	Northern Ireland: Parades
</major-heading>

	<p pid="a.50.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/2">I have been considering Sir George Quigley's review of parades, the subsequent consultation on his report, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee (NIAC) report of January this year and the events of last summer. Each of these offers different perspectives on how to go forward and I have come to a balanced decision about how to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/3">I have decided that a case has not been made to make fundamental changes to parading arrangements in Northern Ireland. Parades have been increasingly peaceful over the past few years. The number of contentious parades has fallen. Out of approximately 2,000 parades notified last year, only 200 were regarded as &quot;contentious&quot; and two resulted in serious public order incidents. I think this shows the success of the arrangements we have here in reducing tension. I want to echo the words of NIAC, which concluded that the Parades Commission remains the best hope for developing the peaceful resolution of disputes. I will therefore not be pressing forward with the changes recommended by Sir George Quigley at this time. I am, however, indebted to Sir George for his insightful and intelligent contribution to the debate around parades in Northern Ireland. Although I am not adopting his recommendations, my thinking has been greatly influenced by his work and I am indebted to him for his insightful and intelligent contribution to the debate around parades in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">I shall be laying an Order in Council to amend the law on parades. The order makes clear that the Parades Commission can make determinations that include supporters and followers. Some doubts have been raised about the commission's remit. The police and NIAC have asked me to put the matter beyond doubt before the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/5">At the same time, I intend to take on board Quigley and NIAC's recommendation that parades and related protests should be considered by the same body. The order will bring protestors within the remit of the Parades Commission. I have been persuaded that the time is right for the Parades Commission to take on this function.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/6">I am also launching a wide-ranging consultation exercise on mediation. I think there is a great deal of potential for mediation to help defuse the tensions surrounding parades and I firmly believe that agreed outcomes are the best way to resolve disputes. However, there has not been agreement about how best to deliver mediation. I have today published a consultation paper on these issues. The consultation will close on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-23">23 May 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/7">The NIAC's report contained other recommendations about how the Parades Commission could make the way it carries out its work more effective. I am aware that the commission is examining these and I look forward to hearing their response.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.3/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/2">The 27th report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which makes recommendations about the pay of the Senior Civil Service, senior military personnel and the judiciary, is being published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Libraries of the House. The Government are grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/3">The main recommendations of the review body for the Senior Civil Service are:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/4" class="indent">An uplift from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> of 2.5 per cent to the pay range minima and target rates for each of the Senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary and a 3 per cent uplift to the pay range ceilings;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/5" class="indent">Individual base pay awards to range from 0 to 9 per cent depending on contribution with an average award of 4.2 per cent;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/6" class="indent">The bonus pot to increase by 1 per cent to 5 per cent of pay bill and that the minimum non-consolidated bonus payment to remain at &pound;2,500;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/7" class="indent">The Permanent Secretaries' new range is to be &pound;130,350 to &pound;264,250;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/8" class="indent">Further information should be collected on the reasons why senior civil servants leave the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/9">The main recommendation of the review body for the senior military is:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/10" class="indent">An increase from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> of 2.5 per cent in the incremental pay scales for senior military officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/11">The main recommendation of the review body for the judiciary is:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/12" class="indent">An increase from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> of 3 per cent in judicial salaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/13" class="indent">The Government accept these recommendations. Their cost will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/14">Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the movement of the mid point of the pay bands for the Senior Civil Service. Their salaries will therefore increase by 2.8 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>.</p>

	Prison Service Pay Review Body
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-02-22a.56.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="56"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050222/text/50222-46.htm#50222-46_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.56.1/1">The fourth report of the Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) on the pay of in-charge governors and operational managers, prison officers and related grades in England and Wales in 2005 has been published today and copies placed in the Library. I would like to thank the chair and members of the PSPRB for their hard work in producing their recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/2">The PSPRB has recommended a 2.5 per cent basic increase to pay rates for prison officer and related grades and to in-charge governors and other operational managers. It has recommended a slightly higher increase of 3 per cent for senior officers to improve the pay differential for what they regard as an increasingly important operational grade. The basic award of 2.5 per cent is at the same level as the December 2004 figure for all-items inflation excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX). Most in-charge governors and other operational managers receive performance payments on top of their basic award, which contribute to earnings growth for them above the level of inflation. Just under half of all prison officers will also receive increments, adding to earnings growth for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/3">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has decided that the recommendations will be implemented in full, with effect from the operative date of the award of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. The cost of the award will be met from within the existing budget allocation for the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/4">There is now a pressing need to look, for the next pay round and beyond, at a multi-year settlement to give a framework for Modernisation. This will involve a comprehensive review of existing pay systems to support reform, which is essential to achieving the goals of a Modern service and in enabling it to operate in the new environment of contestability. We have therefore tasked officials to discuss urgently with the pay review body how this can best be achieved against the background, recognised by the review body, of continuing financial constraints. The Home Secretary expects to issue a remit letter to this effect in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/5">The key recommendations of the report are:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/6" class="indent">A 2.5 per cent basic increase to pay rates for prison officer and related grades and operational managers from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/7" class="indent">A 3 per cent basic increase for senior officers from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/8">An increase of 6 per cent to the maxima and minima of the pay scales for senior operational managers;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/9">No change to local pay allowance rates from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. These remain at:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/10" class="indent">&pound;4,000 per annum for the &quot;top&quot; rate (mainly London)</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/11" class="indent">&pound;3,100 per annum for the &quot;high&quot; rate</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/12" class="indent">&pound;2,600 per annum for the &quot;middle&quot; rate</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/13" class="indent">&pound;1,100 per annum for the &quot;lower&quot; rate</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/14">Required hours addition for operational managers to be increased by the basic award figure (2.5 per cent);</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/15">Healthcare specialist allowance increased by 2.5 per cent but all others frozen at current rates; and</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/16">All other allowances (tornado, bedwatch, on call, dirty protest, etc) increased by 2.5 per cent except for the care and maintenance of dogs allowance to be increased by 1 per cent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-02-22a.62.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="62"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050222/text/50222-48.htm#50222-48_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.62.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/2"><i>Introduction</i> The 14th report of the School Teachers' Review Body is being published today. It covers a range of matters referred to the review body in July 2004. Copies are available in the Vote Office and in the Library of the House of Lords and at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk">www.teachernet.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/3">In making its recommendations, the review body was required to have regard to the matters set out in the remit letter of <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-22">22 July 2004</phrase>. The fourteenth STRB report deals with some very important and technical issues affecting teachers' pay and I am most grateful to it for the careful and detailed attention it has given to these complex matters. The STRB recommendations are set out below (in italics) followed in each case by my response.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/4">I am seeking consultation comments on the report and my response by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/5" class="italic">Payments for additional responsibilities for teaching and learning</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/6">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/7" class="indent">We recommend that the following criterion and factors for awarding teaching and learning responsibility (TLR) payments be adopted:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/8" class="italic">The criterion is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/9" class="indent">A teaching and learning responsibility payment may only be made to a teacher who is accountable for a significant, specified responsibility focused on teaching and learning, that is not required of all classroom teachers, clearly defined in the job description of the teaching and learning responsibility payment holder, and requiring teachers' professional skills and judgement. The TLR payment should be for a sustained responsibility in the context of the school's staffing structure needed to ensure continued delivery of high-quality teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/10"><i>The factors are as follows:</i>Impact on educational progress beyond the teacher's assigned pupils;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/11" class="indent">Leading, developing and enhancing the teaching practice of others;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/12" class="indent">Having accountability for leading, managing and developing a subject or curriculum area or pupil development across the curriculum; and (for the upper value TLR)</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/13" class="indentitalic">Having line management responsibility for a significant number of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/14" class="italic">We recommend that there should be guidance on the review of staffing structures and implementation and that it should include advice to assist schools/LEAs in deciding: how to address their head of year and &quot;pastoral&quot; responsibilities in the new system; what type of TLR should be payable for specific line management posts; and the application of TLRs to unattached teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/15">We recommend that:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/16" class="indent">From <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>, the value of TLR2 be a minimum of &pound;2,250 with a maximum of &pound;5,500, and the value of TLR1 be a minimum of &pound;6,500 with a maximum of &pound;11,000;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/17" class="indent">Teachers be paid a spot rate on the appropriate TLR range for specific posts as decided and published by the school in its pay policy;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/18" class="indent">Differentials between payments within each range within specific schools should be significant&mdash;a minimum of &pound;1,500; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/19" class="indentitalic">The guidance on the review of staffing structures and implementation contains advice to support schools in deciding what level of spot rate payment to award TLR posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/20">We recommend that the circumstances in which the payment of TLRs should cease, should be as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/21" class="indent">Payments should not be portable from one school to another;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/22" class="indent">Payments should be withdrawn where a teacher declined to perform the responsibilities attached to the payment; or lost the responsibilities as a result of poor performance (as a result of capability procedures); and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/23" class="indentitalic">Payments could also be withdrawn when responsibilities were restructured, subject to transitional/safeguarding arrangements applied nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/24" class="italic">We recommend that all the main parties be included, without pre-conditions, in formulating guidance for schools on the review of staffing structures and implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/25">Subject to the timely provision of guidance and budget information to schools, we recommend specifically that:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/26" class="indent">Schools be required to review their staffing structure in consultation with staff and their representatives, and to publish their revised structure, with a timetable for implementation (as an annex to the pay policy of the school), by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/27" class="indent">TLR payments be available to be awarded from <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase> and new awards of management allowances cease from <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/28" class="indent">The transition period for each school starts from the date of publication of its staffing structure, lasts for three years and ends by <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2008</phrase>; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/29" class="indent">Teachers who would otherwise incur a reduction in salary as a result of the implementation of changes in responsibilities in the revised staffing structure of the school, have their salary cash safeguarded for the duration of the three year period of transition, the safeguarding to cease in the following circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/30" class="indent">The teacher accepts a new level of payment;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/31" class="indent">The teacher moves post;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/32" class="indent">The teacher's salary (through annual increment, movement to a higher salary scale or receipt of a higher level of TLR payment) excluding the management allowance, is higher than the total of his/her current salary including the management allowance; or</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/33" class="indentitalic">The teacher unreasonably refuses to undertake responsibilities required of a new post offered to him/her.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/34" class="italic">Our recommendations should be applied to Wales in accordance with constitutional responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/35">I welcome these recommendations. I believe that they represent a genuinely constructive opportunity for schools to organise their teaching and learning responsibilities in a new way, focusing on the professionalism of teachers and enabling reward to be given for significant tasks which have an impact on the educational progress of pupils and the professional practice of other teachers. I am particularly glad to recognise the flexibilities, within an overall framework, recommended within the new teaching and learning responsibility payments system, and the emphasis on openness through the pay policy, which would give schools the freedom to establish the arrangements which suit their own needs, while openly justifying their decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/36">However, I am anxious that all schools should have sufficient time to prepare and consider what staffing structure is most appropriate for them before implementation of these pay changes. To promote clarity and consistency I propose that all schools' transition periods should begin on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>, at which point TLR payments should be available and management allowances would cease to be awarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/37">I also welcome the focus on restructuring, which will be key to enabling the transition from the existing management allowance system to be managed. Action on school restructuring in Wales will, of course, be for the Welsh Assembly to determine.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/38">I agree that guidance to schools on restructuring, transition and the new TLR payments system will be very important. However, I believe that the guidance should not be restrictive or suggest different levels of TLR payment for different tasks or responsibilities. I believe that the detailed criteria and factors for the payment of TLRs should be the focus for schools' (and in the case of unattached teachers, LEAs') decisions, and that this should be sufficient to enable them to take appropriate decisions within the context of their own individual published structures. All parties will, as usual, be consulted on the development of statutory guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/39">I agree that the arrangements for the award of TLRs also require provisions for their future cessation and the recommendations of the STRB are sensible and helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/40">I welcome the proposed arrangements for transition from management allowances to TLRs, and the proposed provisions giving protections for teachers who would otherwise incur a reduction in salary, which are fair and reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/41" class="italic">Safeguarding arrangements for pay</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/42" class="italic">We recommend that:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/43" class="italic">The framework for the operation of safeguarding that we describe below be adopted to apply to both current and future safeguarding arrangements:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/44" class="italic">Framework for the operation of safeguarding</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/45" class="italic">A. Overarching principles</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/46" class="indentitalic">a. Teachers at all levels are protected from sudden drops in total salary which would otherwise occur through no fault of their own.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/47" class="indentitalic">b. Safeguarding principles will be applied on a mandatory basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/48" class="indentitalic">c. Safeguarding will operate on a fixed-period basis and the period will be three years (subject to the provisions in C below).</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/49" class="indentitalic">d. Safeguarding will be on a cash basis; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/50" class="indentitalic">e. The teacher must know at the start of the safeguarding period what safeguarding arrangements are applicable to any particular salary element and this must be set out in the teacher's salary statement at the start of the period.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/51" class="italic">B. Cases where safeguarding will operate</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/52">Subject to the basic principles in A above and the provisions in C below, safeguarding will apply in circumstances where:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/53" class="indent">a. The item concerned has been removed from the pay system;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/54" class="indent">b. The item concerned has been replaced, directly or indirectly, by another form or forms of payment which the teacher concerned is not receiving;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/55" class="indent">c. An individual school range has been reduced;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/56" class="indent">d. An LEA reorganisation, school closure, or redefinition of boundaries, means that a teacher continuing to work in the school or LEA as applicable would otherwise receive a reduced rate of pay; or</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/57" class="indentitalic">e. Internal school reorganisations take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/58" class="italic">C. Cases where safeguarding will not apply, or will cease to apply</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/59">Safeguarding will not apply, or will cease to apply, where any of the following circumstances occur:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/60" class="indent">a. The teacher moves school voluntarily;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/61" class="indent">b. The teacher chooses to apply, and applies successfully for another post within the school and accepts the terms and conditions of that post;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/62" class="indent">c. The teacher unreasonably refuses to carry out duties commensurate with the salary being received;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/63" class="indent">d. The teacher's total salary overtakes his safeguarded salary during the safeguarded period (excluding the effect of annual pay uplifts); or</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/64" class="indentitalic">e. The set period of time has elapsed (three years).</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/65">We also recommend:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/66" class="indent">That the framework be the vehicle within which the Secretary of State should deal with the safeguarding consequentials of future changes to the pay system; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/67" class="indentitalic">That the three-year time-limiting for safeguarding of current arrangements be applied to operate concurrently with the three-year period for the transitional arrangements to introduce revised school structures.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/68">The issue of safeguarding has been flagged up by the STRB on successive occasions in the past, and it has previously requested evidence on it. I very much welcome the careful and detailed consideration which the STRB has now been able to give to this matter, in the light of evidence received. The proposed safeguarding provisions set out are reasonable and balanced and I support them.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/69">I recognise the difficulties and sensitivities which exist in the context of bringing change to this area of the teachers' pay system, and the framework proposed will enable existing and future safeguarding to be handled on a fair, uniform and predictable basis. Moreover, the framework as proposed will ensure that teachers are protected from sudden drops in total salary which would otherwise occur through no fault of their own, for a suitable period. I also welcome the recommendation of the STRB that these detailed matters are handled in future using my subsidiary powers, within the context of the framework established, which seems to be entirely appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/70" class="italic">Pay arrangements for secondary mathematics and science advanced skills teachers</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/71">We recommend that:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/72" class="indent">In line with its policy of expanding the AST grade, the department looks at ways of getting more mathematics and science teachers with AST accreditation, but not in an AST post, into such posts, including, where appropriate, the creation of additional AST posts in these subjects;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/73" class="indent">This message be reinforced in the guidance to schools, primary and secondary, on the review of their structures which will take place as part of the transition to the new TLR system; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/74" class="indent">Schools be encouraged to make greater use of the flexibilities they already have to set AST pay for these two subjects;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/75" class="indentitalic">Paragraph 27.3 of the STPCD be amended so that the factors to which the relevant body has to have regard in setting the range for an AST's pay expressly include his or her being a teacher of a shortage subject or a subject where there is a particular need to raise the quality of teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/76">The remit to the STRB invited it to consider the salary levels of secondary mathematics and science advanced skills teachers. The evidence backed this up by proposing that the cap on the pay of these teachers be removed, and to set a minimum level of salary of f40,000. This was proposed as part of the Government's approach to overcoming the national under-achievements in these two subjects and their impact on the economy, as identified in the reports of Professor Adrian Smith and Sir Gareth Roberts.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/77">The STRB has reflected carefully on this but has concluded that at present it will not make recommendations along the lines proposed. It has indicated that this could be considered further in a future remit, in the wider context of teachers' remuneration as a whole. I continue to see benefits in making changes to the pay arrangements for these teachers in these important subject areas. I therefore am content to return to this matter in my next remit.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/78">It has also made some specific pay-related proposals which I propose to accept. I will reflect further on the STRB's proposals relating to getting more mathematics and science teachers with an AST accreditation, but not currently in an AST post, into such posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/79" class="italic">Excellent Teacher Scheme</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/80" class="italic">We recommend that the scheme should be introduced from September 2006, distinct from the main and upper pay scales. The scheme should be post-based and should be for exemplary classroom teachers with an established record of sustained high-quality teaching and of supporting colleagues within the school. Like ASTs they should be unable to hold TLRs, but unlike ASTs they should have no outreach function. They should:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/81" class="indentitalic">Continue to maintain high standards;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/82" class="indentitalic">Demonstrate a commitment to develop themselves professionally;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/83" class="indentitalic">Provide an exemplary role model for staff through their professional expertise; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/84" class="indentitalic">Have a distinctive role in achieving improvements in teaching across the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/85">In addition to their normal classroom duties the specific expectations of an Excellent Teacher should be:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/86" class="indent">Induction of newly qualified teachers;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/87" class="indent">Professional mentoring of other teachers;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/88" class="indent">Sharing good practice through demonstration lessons;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/89" class="indent">Helping teachers to develop their expertise in planning, preparation and assessment;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/90" class="indent">Helping other teachers to evaluate the impact of their teaching on pupils;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/91" class="indent">Undertaking classroom observations to assist and support the performance management process; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/92" class="indentitalic">Helping teachers improve their teaching practice including those on capability procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/93">However, we also recommend the following;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/94" class="indent">The expectations of the role set out above should reflect more strongly an emphasis on general pedagogic experience and on coaching and mentoring, and reduce the apparent overlap with the AST grade and with TLR payments;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/95" class="indent">That teachers should be able to seek accreditation regardless of whether or not an ETS post is envisaged for their school and that the title of Excellent Teacher (though not the associated salary) should be granted once accreditation has been achieved; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/96" class="indentitalic">Serious consideration should be given to a separate name for the post associated with the scheme, and to our suggestion of &quot;Principal Teacher&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/97">We recommend that the criteria for accessing the scheme should be as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/98" class="indent">The scheme should be based on written application. To qualify, the teacher should have to have been paid on U3 for at least two years, be willing to meet the expectations of an Excellent Teacher, and have their application endorsed by their head teacher. They would also need to provide evidence of work during their period on the upper pay scale that had addressed the identified needs of a particular group or groups of pupils; and successfully pass a procedure of external assessment against national standards;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/99" class="indent"><i>A separate national (England and Wales) standard should be developed for the scheme, building on a common core of excellence with the AST standard, to take account of the distinctive profile and features of the scheme; subject to discussion with the Welsh Assembly Government, this standard might be based on the three themes of new professionalism in teaching1</i> and the requirements of an Excellent Teacher should reflect more closely the three themes of new professionalism in teaching, again subject to discussion with the Welsh Assembly Government;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/100" class="indent">The admission criteria for the scheme should include demonstration of a sustained record of continuing professional development throughout the teacher's career;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/101" class="indent">The arrangements should be clarified for movement between the scheme, ASTs and the leadership group; and</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/102" class="indentitalic">The scheme be open to any teacher who meets the criteria and has their head teacher's support, not just those in schools which have or envisage a post under the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/103" class="italic">The salary for the scheme should be a spot salary. We recommend the following baseline rates for the scheme, as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>: &pound;35,000 in England and Wales, &pound;35,988 in the fringe, &pound;37,832 in outer London, and &pound;41,745 in inner London. We do not think it appropriate at this stage to set a salary for September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/104" class="italic">We recommend that the basic structure of this reformed career system remain in its present form for the medium term.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/105">1 &quot;New Professionalism&quot; as set out in the department's five year strategy, sets out the proposal that career progression and financial rewards should be for those who are:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/106" class="indent">making the biggest contributions to improving pupil attainment;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/107" class="indentitalic">continually developing their own expertise; and helping to develop expertise in other teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/108" class="italic">We recommend a targeted communications exercise to ensure teachers are aware of the reformed career structure and the implications for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/109" class="italic">We recommend that the department monitors actively the bedding down of the ETS and how the ETS and AST schemes are used so the review body can revisit it in three years after the scheme's introduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/110">I welcome the proposed creation of the post-based Excellent Teacher scheme, and believe that the arrangements set out give a firm basis for progress in its introduction. There are, however, some specific matters which require further consideration and on which I would invite particular comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/111">I note the recommendation that the expectations of the role should be revised and I am happy to consider this further in the light of consultation responses and further discussions. The same applies to the proposal to develop a separate ETS standard taking account of new professionalism. It is certainly our intention to see the ETS&mdash;as well as standards for other teachers&mdash;in this light.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/112">I believe that the proposal to enable widespread assessment for ETS, regardless of whether a post is available, should be a matter for further consideration and discussion, taking account of the necessity for effective implementation of the scheme. I do, however, have greater concerns about the STRB's concept of naming a teacher as an Excellent Teacher if they have passed assessment, if they are not in a post, while giving a new and separate name to those in post, and suspect that this may cause undue confusion. I would welcome views on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/113">I note the initial salary outlines recommended, which provide a very helpful steer for the future. I shall refer this matter to the STRB in my next remit, in the context of a request for general consideration of salaries from September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/114" class="italic">Local approaches to pay and other matters</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/115" class="italic">On localised approaches to pay we see no difficulty in postponing further consideration of this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/116">I accept this and, as indicated in evidence, will return to the matter in the context of my next remit.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/117" class="italic">We recommend that the National Employers' Organisation publishes the result of the LEA survey on unattached teachers and any additional steps to be taken to deal with the concerns about unattached teachers by the end of March 2005 so that we can consider progress and make any further recommendations we consider appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/118">This is a helpful steer, which I shall ask NEOST to consider. I shall also seek to ensure that the framework and guidance on the implementation of the pay changes recommended here take as full account as possible of the position of unattached teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/119" class="italic">We recommend that all the main parties be included in the process (on linking teaching and learning reviews to continuing professional development and career progression) as outlined in the remit letter of <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-22">22 July 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/120">I remain committed to the process with partners referred to in the <phrase class="date" code="">22 July</phrase> remit. All parties will have the opportunity to respond to statutory consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/121" class="italic">Next steps</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/122">I am now initiating consultation on these recommendations and my proposed response with the employers' organisation, the teacher unions and other interested parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/123">Concurrently with this, I am consulting, as required under Section 126 of the Education Act 2002, on a pay order for introduction on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, the main purpose of which is to reform the safeguarded position of the small number of teachers on former points 4 and 5 of the upper pay scale, in line with the safeguarding principles set out above.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.1/15">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from increases in gross administration costs, mainly, &pound;61,544,000 met from the central reserve to enable the GOGGS East building to be brought on to the department's balance sheet. A further increase of &pound;29,000,000 and &pound;3,400,000, which is also being met from the central reserve for continued work on Child Trust Fund and for Team Bonus payments, respectively. HM Treasury is to transfer &pound;99,000, for the cost of capital in respect of the GOGGS East building. Cabinet Office will be transferring &pound;1,790,000, due to the change in funding arrangements for the Parliamentary Counsel Office; and, Department for Work and Pensions is transferring &pound;1,661,000, for child benefit work on the Payment Modernisation Programme and the Child Benefit Cheque Payment Service. These transfers are partially offset by a transfer of &pound;2,964,000 to HM Treasury to meet the costs of the transfer of tax policy work for the first half of the financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.1/1">My honourable friend the Financial Secretary (Mr Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/2">Subject to parliamentary approval of any necessary Supplementary Estimate, the Office for National Statistics DEL will increase by &pound;12,631,000 from &pound;178,004,000 to &pound;190,635,000. The Office for National Statistics winter supplementary incorrectly overstated the administration costs limit. This supplementary corrects the position. The administration costs limit will increase by &pound;4,472,000 from &pound;152,990,000 to &pound;157,462,000. Within the DEL change, the impact on resources and capital are as set out in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.75.1/14">* Depreciation, which forms part of resource DEL, is excluded from the total DEL since capital DEL includes capital spending and to include depreciation of those assets would lead to double counting.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/15">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from the draw-down of &pound;4,679,000 administration costs end-year flexibility as set out in the Public Expenditure Outturn White Paper (Cm 6293). This is partially offset by a transfer of &pound;207,000 in total to other government departments in relation to work to develop the Neighbourhood Statistics programme. The transfers comprise &pound;171,000 to the Home Office and &pound;36,000 to HM Customs and Excise.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/16">The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from the draw-down of &pound;8,229,000 capital end-year flexibility as set out in the Public Expenditure Outturn White Paper (Cm 6293). This is partly off-set by a transfer of &pound;70,000 to HM Customs and Excise in relation to work to develop the Neighbourhood Statistics programme.</p>

	Pensions: Financial Assistance Scheme
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-02-22a.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100298" speakername="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" colon=":" colnum="76"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050222/text/50222-50.htm#50222-50_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.76.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1316" name="Malcolm Wicks">My honourable friend the Minister for Pensions (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">In December 2004 we said that our priority was getting help to those facing the most urgent difficulties being closest to, or already at, retirement age and therefore less able to make provision to replace their lost pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">At that time we had asked independent trustees to provide data on the pension schemes that they thought might be eligible for the financial assistance scheme. We had a very good response and from the information provided it appears that there are at least 380 schemes in which members might be potentially eligible for financial assistance. The precise scale of the financial shortfalls in these schemes cannot be known until the winding-up processes are close to completion.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/4">A list of these potentially eligible schemes has been placed in the Library. It is a provisional list which broadly confirms earlier estimates of the scale of the problem, and the number of individuals affected. The detailed eligibility criteria for both schemes and members will be set out in regulations that we expect to publish for wider consultation in the spring. Once finalised these will need parliamentary approval, which we hope to obtain by the end of July.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/5">As solvent employers have a duty to support their schemes and provide the benefits members were expecting, it is right that the FAS focuses on insolvent employers. We expect employers to stand by their pension promise to their employees, and will take a dim view of the solvent employer who seeks to avoid their responsibilities to their employees or the employees of a company for which they have been a parent company. We have consulted widely on how we should define &quot;employer insolvency&quot; and concluded that for FAS purposes we should have a sufficiently general definition of insolvency to capture schemes where the sponsoring employer no longer exists and also where insolvency may have occurred some time after scheme wind-up had started. This definition will be similar to that used by the PPF but with the additional inclusion of some companies which have undergone members' voluntary liquidations&mdash;where a declaration of solvency was made at the time of wind-up but where the company is now no longer solvent and so no employer exists to support the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/6">We are minded to judge the insolvency position for multi-employer schemes on the principal employer of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/7">The list contains those pension schemes on which we received information in the latest data collection exercise and which from the information provided by trustees appear potentially eligible under the criteria set out above. The list provides an early indication of scheme eligibility for members of the schemes we have been told about. But I need to make clear a number of caveats. First, it will take time to establish the final position, but as wind-up progresses we will become clearer on the size of the gap between assets and liabilities of these schemes. Secondly, presence on this list does not guarantee individuals will receive support from the FAS. Thirdly, it does not mean trustees should stop their duties of securing the best possible outcome for their scheme members.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/8">After the FAS regulations have come into force, there will be a six-month period during which we shall accept formal notification from the independent trustees of other under-funded pension schemes, which may in due course be added to the list, so absence from this list does not preclude eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/9">While we have sought industry contributions, it is very disappointing that no financial contribution has been forthcoming. As a result the available funding stands at &pound;400 million over 20 years, which the Government have committed on behalf of the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/10">As we have explained before, in many cases the trustees are not yet able to provide detailed information on the scale of individual losses and in practice this may not be available until they are close to completing the winding-up of each pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/11">But those scheme members who have already retired or expect to retire within the next few years need to know where they stand now.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/12">I can therefore announce today that the Financial Assistance Scheme will provide help to those within three years of their scheme pension age on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May 2004</phrase>. The assistance will top up individuals to a level broadly equivalent to 80 per cent of the core pension rights accrued in their scheme. That means that those within three years of their pension scheme age on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May 2004</phrase> should expect to get 80 per cent of their core promised pension. As we previously announced, payments will be subject to a <i>de minimis</i> level and a cap on assistance provided. Further information on these will be provided when the draft regulations are published.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/13">The assistance will be paid as a monthly pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/14">FAS payments will be treated by the tax and benefit system in broadly the same way as payments from an occupational pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/15">We have already committed ourselves to review the Financial Assistance Scheme after three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/16">Government funding is already fixed for the current spending review period up to and including 2007&ndash;08. But as with all our spending plans, we will review the funding for the FAS in the next spending review alongside other spending priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/17">A dedicated team of DWP officials, based in York, will administer the scheme and aim to get payments to recipients as soon as possible once the regulations are in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/2">I am responding on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to the 34th report of the review body on doctors' and dentists' remuneration (DDRB) which is published today. Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office and the Library. I am grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/3">This year's report deals primarily with general dental practitioners, doctors and dentists in training, non-consultant career grade doctors, and medical and dental consultants who have chosen not to take up new contracts. For consultants taking up new contracts, general medical practitioners and the salaried primary dental care services, 2005&ndash;06 will be the third year of three-year pay deals agreed as part of NHS pay reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/4">The review body has recommended with effect from April 2005 general increases in remuneration of 3.0 per cent for doctors and dentists in training and consultants who remain on the old contract, 3.225 per cent for non-consultant career grade doctors and an increase of 3.4 per cent in gross fees for general dental practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/5">These recommendations are being accepted in full and without staging.</p>
