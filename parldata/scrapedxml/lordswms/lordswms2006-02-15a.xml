	Land Registry: Electronic Conveyancing
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-02-15a.89.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="89"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60215-41.htm#60215-41_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.89.1/1">Land Registry has carried out extensive further consultation with stakeholders on the introduction of electronic conveyancing in England and Wales since the formal consultation exercise in 2002. The implementation of this important reform programme will continue to be carried out incrementally. A prototype in 2006 (the Chain Matrix) and a pilot exercise in the second half of 2007 (the system to be used for domestic sales) are planned, with further releases as the system progresses. These exercises will be limited to voluntary users. Once sufficient experience of the new system has been gained, the Secretary of State and Land Registry will initiate a consultation process with stakeholders over the form of the rules which will make e-conveyancing compulsory for most transactions. If Parliament approves those rules, I would expect the implementation of the compulsory provisions to take place as soon a possible, which is likely to be in 2009 or 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.3/4">NHS trusts and primary care trusts will receive operational capital for the purpose of renewing their existing asset bases and for modernising their equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.3/5">Strategic health authorities will receive strategic capital to fund larger scale investments facilitating strategic change.
