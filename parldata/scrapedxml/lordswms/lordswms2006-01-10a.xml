	Court Fees
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-01-10a.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="3"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60110-31.htm#60110-31_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.3.1/1">I am today announcing the outcome of the recent consultation on civil and family court fee increases. The consultation paper was published on <phrase class="date" code="">23 September</phrase> and the consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase>. Some 50 responses were received from the judiciary, legal profession and other stakeholder bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">After careful consideration of these, my noble and learned friend the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor has, with two exceptions, decided to proceed with all the fee increases proposed. Three statutory instruments containing the new civil, family and magistrates' court fees were laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase> and will take effect today. A report analysing the responses to consultation in detail will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3">The Lord Chancellor has decided not to introduce at this stage the proposed increase from &pound;210 to &pound;380 of the fee for an application for ancillary relief. Consultees expressed particularly strong concerns about the size and timing of this proposal. There were also concerns that a detrimental impact on access to justice in this context could also harm any children of the family. It will be necessary to look again at this fee following the planned review of the system of exemptions and remissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">The Lord Chancellor has also decided not to pursue the proposed increases to the fees for issuing lower value monetary claims. Some consultees were concerned that these fees were disproportionately high relative to the amount claimed. These increases would also run counter to our longer-term strategy of achieving a better match between income and cost within the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/5">The increases will raise about &pound;10.6 million additional income in the current financial year, &pound;43 million in a full year. They are necessary to ensure that Her Majesty's Courts Service can balance its budget and meet its cost recovery targets for this and future years. As the consultation paper made clear, the need to raise this income and the underlying fees policy were not in question; the issue was whether the particular package of increases proposed was most apt to meet the need.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/6">A key objective of that package, with which the majority of those who commented agreed in principle, was to harmonise the fees, which shall enable more effective allocation of cases to the lowest appropriate level of judiciary. This in turn will benefit court users by enabling many cases to be dealt with more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/7">The Government's policy remains that court fees should generally be set to reflect (on average) the cost of the service provided. Where they can afford to do so, it is right that litigants using the civil courts, rather than the taxpayer, should meet the cost. This ensures that the taxpayers' contribution to the cost of the civil and family courts is focused on funding the cost of the system of fee exemptions and remissions, in order to ensure that less well-off citizens are not denied access to justice. Setting fees generally at levels lower than the full cost would mean that corporations and other wealthy litigants would benefit from the taxpayers' contribution&mdash;increasing cost and putting pressures on other budgets like legal aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/8">The current increases form part of our longer term strategy for court fees. Its objectives are to ensure that the system:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/9" class="indent">meets the cost recovery targets set for civil, family and probate business (including, as appropriate, the cost of investment to modernise the courts);</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/10" class="indent">protects access to justice through a well targeted system of exemptions and remissions;</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/11" class="indent">ensures that the taxpayers' contribution to the cost of the court system remains affordable; and</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/12" class="indent">so far as practicable, broadly matches the level of particular fees or sets of related fees to the cost of the particular processes and type of case concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/13">This year, we plan to undertake two major reviews as the next steps in delivering this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/14">The first will be a fundamental review of the system of exemptions and remissions to ensure that it adequately protects access to justice and is operated consistently. This review will be overseen by a steering group of stakeholders, including representatives of the civil and family justice councils, which I will chair.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/15">The second will review the structure of the system, that is, the points at which fees are charged. The key objective will be to achieve a closer match of income and cost drivers, in particular through the introduction of trial fees. This is necessary both to make the system fairer as between different types of litigant, and make it easier to ensure that cost and funding remain in balance as workload changes. This review will also consider the various specific suggestions for changing the fee structure raised by respondents to consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.1/1">The reply of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Jack Straw) of <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase> to the question put by <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the right honourable Member for North East Fife, Sir Menzies Campbell, (<i>Official Report</i>, House of Commons, Col. 1652W)</phrase>, stated that officials had identified a few instances during the administration of President Clinton where the US authorities had requested permission to render a detainee through UK territory or airspace. I added that officials continued to search the records.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/2">Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials have now completed a search of all relevant records back to May 1997. This search has turned up one further case, also in 1998: the Government declined a US request to refuel a flight carrying two detainees en route to the US.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.1/1">The arms embargo in Iraq continues under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 with exemptions for supplies of arms and related materiel required by the Government of Iraq (GoI) or the multi-national force (MNF) to serve the purposes of the resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/2">Following a thorough review of their procedures for processing export licence applications to Iraq, Her Majesty's Government will consider as exempt from the embargo exports to the GoI, the MNF, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, diplomatic missions in Iraq and entities contracted or subcontracted to GoI or the MNF. Export licence applications to these end users will not therefore require the approval of the GoI or MNF prior to approval of the application. For exports serving the purposes of UNSCR 1546 to entities other than these, Her Majesty's Government will seek the approval of the GoI or MNF to ensure that the proposed export is exempt from the embargo. Her Majesty's Government will keep the Government of Iraq informed on a quarterly basis of all exports of military equipment to Iraq.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-01-10a.7.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="7"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60110-32.htm#60110-32_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.7.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Alistair Darling) made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/2">Ports in the United Kingdom play a vital role in supporting the national economy and contributing to sustainable development. The Government are committed to maintaining and enhancing that role through its broad approach to ports policy and through the decisions it takes on individual ports applications. We aim to exercise our responsibility in respect of applications as promptly as possible, consistent with the need to consider all relevant factors and allow all interested parties sufficient opportunity to comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/3">I can now report to the House that, as part of that process, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Derek Twigg) announced on <phrase class="date" code="">21 December</phrase> that he was minded to approve the proposal from Hutchison Ports UK for a container port at Bathside Bay at Harwich, Essex. He noted, however, that there are some matters which require further clarification, including making sure that the right conditions are imposed on the development to secure the necessary highways improvements in good time to provide congestion relief. A similar letter, covering planning and listed building appeals related to the development, was issued by my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister. The Government believe that this expansion in deep-sea container port capacity is justified by the economic benefits it will bring regionally and nationally. But they understand that there should be controls imposed on the development, to provide new road and rail infrastructure so that congestion does not increase, to provide compensatory habitats for wildlife displaced by the scheme, and to reduce other environmental impacts such as noise, pollution and the visual impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/4">My honourable friend had already announced in July last year that he was minded to approve the proposal from P&amp;O Ports for a new container port at London Gateway, near Thurrock in Essex. Working in conjunction with my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister, who had announced in parallel that he was minded to approve the proposed adjoining logistics centre at London Gateway, we have invited representations regarding road access and other matters both on that proposal and now on Bathside Bay. We will consider any representations carefully before moving to final decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/5">My honourable friend is also considering a separate proposal from Hutchison for providing further deep-sea container port capacity through the reconfiguration of the Felixstowe South site in Suffolk. He, together with my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister, expects to make announcements on that shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/6">The ports industry is responding to demand for capacity in other traffic sectors as well. On <phrase class="date" code="">21 December</phrase>, my honourable friend also made a final decision approving the application from Associated British Ports plc to construct a short-sea container terminal at Quay 2005 in Hull. After carefully considering the likely impacts on local residents, and balancing them against the wider economic benefits, the Government are satisfied that this project will overall bring significant benefits to the city of Hull and the region as a whole. The Government are also satisfied that the project's likely impacts on nature conservation sites will be adequately compensated for by the creation of replacement habitat in the Humber estuary.</p>
