	<p pid="a.67.0/1">My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Gordon Brown) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/2">The Economic and Financial Affairs Council will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase> in Luxembourg. The items on the agenda are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/3"><I>Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact: Excessive Deficit Procedures</I></p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/4">Ministers will be asked to agree conclusions abrogating the excessive deficit procedures on Malta, Germany and Greece. In January 2003, the Council decided that Germany's deficit of 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2002 was excessive and gave it a deadline of 2004 to correct this. The deadline was subsequently extended to 2005 and then to 2007, as the deficit remained above 3 per cent. In 2006, the deficit fell to 1.7 per cent of GDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/5">The EDP was started on Greece in 2004 on the basis of a deficit of 3.2 per cent of GDP in 2003. In January 2005, the Council concluded that no effective action had been taken to correct this and gave Greece notice to bring the excessive deficit to an end by 2006. In 2006, the deficit was 2.6 per cent of GDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/6">Malta was deemed to be in excessive deficit in July 2004, following a deficit of 9.7 per cent of GDP in 2003. It was given a deadline of 2006 and last year the deficit declined to 2.6 per cent of GDP.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/7"><I>Convergence Reports by the Commission and the European Central Bank</I></p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/8">Ministers will discuss the convergence reports of the Commission and the ECB for Cyprus and Malta, and Commission proposals for the abrogation of their derogations and for a regulation on the introduction of the euro. This would allow both countries to join the euro as planned on <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2008</phrase>. This will next be discussed by heads of state and government at the European Council on 21 to <phrase class="date" code="">22 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/9"><I>Quality of Public Finances</I></p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/10">This follows up from the discussion at the informal ECOFIN. The Council will receive a report from the Economic Policy Committee on the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances, focusing in particular on the need to improve the measurement of public sector output. The Council is also expected to adopt conclusions on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/11"><I>Tax</I></p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/12"><I>Combating Tax Fraud</I><I>: </I>Ministers will be asked to agree Council conclusions on conventional measures and more radical solutions to combat VAT fraud, including German ideas on the wide reverse charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/13"><I>VAT Package</I><I>: </I>Ministers will discuss a package of measures to modernise the EU VAT regime for the cross-border supply of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/14"><I>Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base: </I>There will be an orientation debate on the CCCTB. The UK does not believe that the competitiveness of the EU would be helped by a harmonised company tax base and remains sceptical about both the principles and the practicalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/15"><I>Code of Conduct on Business Taxation: </I>The report of the code group (chaired by the UK's Paymaster-General, Dawn Primarolo), including a proposed future work programme, will be adopted through conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/16"><I>Joint Transfer Pricing Forum: </I>The forum is a body of tax officials from the member states and business representatives. It has agreed guidelines on the handling of arrangements relating to the tax treatment of certain cross-border transactions between related businesses.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-06-04a.68.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100788" speakername="Lord Truscott" colon=":" colnum="68"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70604-wms0001.htm#0706047000048">
	<p pid="a.68.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-20">20 July 2006</phrase> (<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, col. 51WS), I informed the House that the Government would actively consider a sale of part of its interest in British Energy (BE) via a capital markets transaction. This interest is held by the Nuclear Liabilities Fund (NLF). On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-30">30 May</phrase>, I announced that the Government intended to direct the NLF to sell part of its interest in BE through an equity capital markets transaction and that, further to this, the sale process completed at 4.30 pm on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-31">31 May</phrase>. A total of 450 million shares have been sold through an accelerated book-built offering at a price of 520p per share, raising gross proceeds of approximately &pound;2.34 billion. This includes the exercise of an over-allotment option that has resulted in the sale of 50 million shares.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/3">The NLF is a segregated fund set up at the time of BE's privatisation in 1996 to meet the eventual decommissioning costs of the company's eight existing nuclear power stations. In 2002, when BE was facing an uncertain future and was seeking funding so that it could continue to meet its obligations, the Government stepped in to support a restructuring of the company in order to ensure the safety of nuclear power and the security of electricity supplies. As part of the restructuring, which came into effect in 2005, the NLF was given &pound;275 million in company bonds and the contractual right to receive a proportion of the company's annual adjusted free cash flow. The NLF has the right to convert all or part of this &quot;cash sweep&quot; into shares in BE, which can then be sold on to a third party.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/4">It has been the Government's objective, through this sale, to diversify the NLF's assets, of which 87 per cent had been linked to BE, and therefore reduce the level of risk in its investment. All net proceeds from the sale will go to the NLF, helping to ensure that it is better placed to meet its obligations in relation to the eventual decommissioning costs of BE's nuclear power stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/5">The NLF will convert its contractual entitlement to part of the cash sweep in proportion to the number of shares sold. The effect of the disposal will be to reduce the NLF's economic interest in BE by way of the cash sweep from approximately 64 per cent to approximately 36 per cent (including the over-allotment option). The Government will not direct the NLF to make any further sale of its interest in BE for a period of 90 days from the closing date of the offering. The Government do not intend to direct the NLF to reduce its economic interest in BE by way of the cash sweep to below a strategic interest of 29.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.3/6">The Government and the NLF have appointed Lazard as independent financial advisers and Citigroup Global Markets UK Equity Limited, Deutsche Bank AG and Merrill Lynch International to act as joint book-runners in relation to the transaction.</p>
