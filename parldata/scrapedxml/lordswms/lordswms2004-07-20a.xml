	<p pid="a.9.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-20">20 April 2004</phrase> I formally requested the Independent Monitoring Commission to prepare a security normalisation report under Article 5(2) of the International Agreement between the British and Irish Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/3">Article 5(2) enables the British Government to commission the IMC to prepare a report on security normalisation activity undertaken over a specified period. I asked the IMC to report on all normalisation activities which have taken place since December 1999 up to the present time. The activities are set out in Article 5(1)(a)(i) to (v) of the International Agreement. The IMC report also takes account of views on the effects of normalisation on the ground and the programme of reform to deliver a community based policing environment in Northern Ireland. It is distinct from the monitoring of the programme of normalisation included in the Joint Declaration which is yet to be commenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/4">I am most grateful to the commission for its thorough report. The report is helpful in identifying the extent of steps that have been taken to reduce the security profile in Northern Ireland. The report also recognises that further steps are being taken, but that these must be measured against the prevailing assessment of the security threat. I have placed copies of the second report of the Independent Monitoring Commission in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.3/2">I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses copies of <i>Taking Action: The UK's Strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world, </i>which I published today.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.3/3">This paper is being published by the Department for International Development (DfID) but the following government Departments worked with DfID to help to produce it: the Department of Health, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, HM Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Patent Office, the Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office, the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.3/4">AIDS is one of the greatest threats to eradicating poverty and achieving the millennium development goals. Over the past 25 years the number of people affected by HIV has risen dramatically, from the first AIDS cases identified in the 1980s to the 38 million who are living with HIV and AIDS today. Over 20 million people have died. Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered the severest impact: over 25 million people are currently living with HIV and AIDS and 12 million children have been orphaned by AIDS. By 2010 the number of orphans who will have lost parents to AIDS may rise to 18 million. In Asia and Eastern Europe, there is a serious risk of a generalised epidemic unless action is taken now. In all regions, women and young people are particularly vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.3/5">The UK Government are committed to fighting AIDS and reversing the spread of HIV. The challenges facing the world were set out in the <i>UK's Call for Action on HIV/AIDS</i>,<i> </i>published on World AIDS Day last year. <i>Taking Action: The UK's strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world </i>sets out how the UK will respond to the challenges by: promoting a comprehensive response to tackle prevention, treatment and care as well as addressing the social impact of AIDS; prioritising the needs of women, young people, including orphans and other children; focusing on human rights, stigma and discrimination; and ensuring that action on AIDS is sustainable in the long term as well as responsive to immediate needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.3/6">As announced in the spending review, the UK Government will commit at least &pound;1.5 billion over the next three years to tackle AIDS in the developing world. Of this, at least &pound;150 million will be dedicated to helping orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS, especially in Africa. We will also be doubling our contribution to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria with an additional &pound;77 million over the next three years. This is in addition to extra money for UNAIDS and UNFPA announced in my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="">6 July</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.12.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Geoffrey Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/2">We are pleased to announce the new chapter to the Strategic Defence Review set out the potential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to significantly improve operational effectiveness. UAVs will be a key contributor to network enabled capability and their ability to provide persistent surveillance of the battlefield or theatre of operations, without putting lives at risk has been demonstrated recently by US operations in Afghanistan and coalition operations in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/3">The central element of the UK's current plans for acquiring UAVs is the Watchkeeper programme, which will provide UK commanders with accurate, timely and high quality imagery. Watchkeeper will be an advanced system integrating air vehicles, sensor payloads and ground control facilities. It will be joined to the wider command and control network through communication systems such as Bowman, allowing information to be passed quickly, providing commanders with an improved understanding of the battle space and shortening sensor to shooter times.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.3/4">The competition for entry into the final stage of the Watchkeeper programme has been run between two industrial teams led by Northrop Grumman and Thales Defence Ltd. Both submitted bids reflecting an understanding of the programme requirements, the technical complexities, the project management requirements and UK industrial participation. Following detailed consideration of the proposals, on the basis of value for money and demonstration of the best potential to deliver the required capability, the selection of the team led by Thales Defence Ltd will be announced as the preferred bidder for the Watchkeeper demonstration and manufacturing phase by the Secretary of State for Defence at the Farnborough International Airshow today. Further negotiations will be required before the project is ready to pass its main investment decision. It is planned to start these negotiations immediately. Depending on the outcome of that work, we aim to make the main gate decision on Watchkeeper later this year. The intention remains to bring Watchkeeper into service as soon as possible with capability beginning around the end of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.1/3">The Housing Bill includes several clauses that improve the rights of park home owners. These include two powers allowing the appropriate national authority (Secretary of State for England and National Assembly for Wales in relation to Wales) to make secondary legislation relating to the implied terms and the written statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">Provision has been made for the first exercise of the power to specify new implied terms, and to amend and delete existing ones, to have retrospective effect. It is therefore vital that we address all the important issues in the first exercise of the power. An affirmative resolution approving the order from both Houses of Parliament will be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">In the consultation paper we have proposed 22 changes to the implied terms on which we have already consulted informally. We propose, for example, amendments on, among other things, further tightening of the resale process, increased transparency in the payment system and more residents' rights through the quiet enjoyment of the pitch.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/6">The Housing Bill contains a re-enactment of the power of the appropriate national authority to prescribe requirements with which written statements must comply. The consultation paper proposes several changes to the requirements taking account of the proposed implied terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/7">Copies of the paper are being sent to a wide range of interested parties, including local authorities, trade and resident associations, and others with an interest in this issue. The closing date for responses is <phrase class="date" code="">22 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/8">Copies of the paper will also be placed in the Libraries of the House, and will be available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.5/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/2">I have received the annual reports for the year 2003 from the five recognised supervisory bodies for company auditors: a combined report from the Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and one each from the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants. Copies of the reports have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/3">Schedule 11 to the Companies Act 1989 sets out the requirements which a body must meet to be eligible for recognised supervisory body status. These include requirements to have adequate arrangements for monitoring and enforcing compliance with its rules relating to membership and eligibility&mdash;for example, holding an appropriate qualification, being a fit and proper person, working to technical and ethical standards, maintaining competence&mdash;discipline and investigation of complaints. In these reports, the recognised bodies inform the Government about their activities in relation to these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.5/4">In January 2003 I announced a number of changes to the regulatory regime of the accountancy and audit professions, including the establishment of a new independent inspection unit, located within the Financial Reporting Council, and a professional oversight board for accountancy (POBA), to take over, from this department, my functions under Part II of the Companies Act 1989 in respect of the recognised supervisory bodies. I am pleased to report that these bodies are now established and in operation. The delegation of these powers is dependent on provisions in the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Bill currently before the House and so for the time being my department continues to have responsibility for oversight of the recognised supervisory bodies.</p>

	BBC Charter Review

	<p pid="a.17.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-11">11 December 2003</phrase>, I announced the first phase of BBC Charter review with the launch of a major public consultation. The consultation was supported by a programme of survey research, visits to different parts of the country to hear the views of people in the media industry and the public first hand, and a series of events for children and young people to hear what they had to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/3">By the time the consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase> we had received over 5,000 written responses and there had been over 25,000 unique visitors to the charter review website. We published the responses on the Internet as the consultation proceeded. The research fieldwork we commissioned was completed in June this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/4">Today, I am publishing the results of this consultation and research. The report we are publishing&mdash;<i>What You Said About the BBC</i>&mdash;summarises the main points that were put to us. It does not capture every single one of the many hundreds of issues raised, which is why I am also publishing in full the reports of research and consultation on which <i>What You Said . . . </i> is based. These documents, together with the consultation responses I have already published, should be seen as a complementary package and taken together give a comprehensive picture of the views received.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/5"><i>What You Said . . . </i>contains both praise and criticism. Most people indicated that they value the BBC and hold it in high esteem, but a significant minority disagreed. To those who like the BBC it was generally seen as the best broadcaster for news, documentaries and features about personal interests. But even to many supporters it is seen as being by no means perfect. Although satisfaction levels are high, most people want to see changes. However, there is a clear view that the BBC should continue to remain independent of government, parliamentary and commercial pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/6">People believe the BBC should keep up with developments in new technology and should be a leading partner in new markets&mdash;this will be particularly relevant as we make the journey towards full switchover from analogue to digital broadcasting.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/7">Contributors clearly felt that there was room for improvement in the way the BBC is governed and regulated, although there is more debate to be had about exactly what changes are needed. And on the question of how we should pay for the BBC, the licence fee was widely considered to be the best&mdash;or rather the &quot;least worst&quot;&mdash;method for the time being, although other options were put forward and questions were raised about how the licence fee is set, collected and distributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/8">The findings contained in this report will feed directly into the review of the BBC's charter. As I have said on numerous occasions, the only certain outcome of charter review will be a strong BBC, independent of government.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/9">I have placed copies of <i>What You Said . . . </i>and the supporting research in the Library of the House. Further copies are available from the charter review web site: <a href="http://www.bbccharterreview.org.uk">www.bbccharterreview.org.uk</a>.</p>
