	<p pid="a.139.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Theresa May) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-28">Wednesday 28 July</phrase> the Home Office will be publishing a public consultation on proposals to overhaul the Licensing Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/3">In the coalition agreement, the Government set out a clear programme of reform around alcohol licensing to tackle the crime and anti-social behaviour that is too often associated with binge drinking in the night-time economy. In particular, the Government set out the following commitments which are covered in this consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/4">We will overhaul the Licensing Act to give local authorities and the police much stronger powers to remove licences from, or refuse to grant licences to, any premises that is causing problems;we will allow councils and the police to shut down permanently any shop or bar found to be persistently selling alcohol to children; we will double the maximum fine for underage alcohol sales to &#163;20,000; we will permit local councils to charge more for late-night licences to pay for additional policing; andwe will ban the sale of alcohol below cost price.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/5">While we recognise the important role which pubs can play as part of the fabric of neighbourhoods and communities, the introduction of the Licensing Act in 2005 has not brought with it a vibrant &quot;caf&#233; culture&quot;. Too often on a Friday and Saturday night, the police and local A&amp;E departments bear the brunt of some of the worst excesses of binge drinking and alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder. We are determined to change this, and will be proposing to introduce more flexibility into the current licensing regime to allow local authorities and the police to clamp down on alcohol-related crime and disorder hot spots within local night-time economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/6">The consultation document will be available on the Home Office website and printed copies will also be available in the Vote Office.</p>

	Animals in Scientific Procedures: Statistics and Annual Report

	<p pid="a.139.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Lynne Featherstone) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/2">The <I>Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals-Great Britain-2009</I> (HC 317), was laid before the House today. Copies will be available in the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/3">This annual statistical report meets the requirement in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to inform Parliament about the licensed use of animals for experimental or other scientific purposes. It also forms the basis for meeting periodic reporting requirements at EU level. Supplementary information with additional tables is also available on the Home Office website.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/4">The statistical report shows an overall decrease of 36,540 (-1 per cent) in the number of procedures started, from 3,656,080 in 2008 to 3,619,540 in 2009. This fall followed six previous annual increases and is the second highest total since the current method of recording was introduced in 1987. A number of factors, such as investment in research and development and strategic funding priorities, determine the overall level of scientific procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/5">The Home Office, as regulatory authority under the 1986 Act, ensures that its provisions are rigorously applied and only authorises work that is scientifically justified and minimises the numbers of animals used and the animal suffering that may be caused.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/6">The statistical report and supplementary information can be found at: <a href="http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice">http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice</a>. gov.uk/animal-research/publications-and-reference/statistics/.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/7">I am also pleased to inform the House that I have today placed in the Library the annual report of the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Division and Inspectorate for the year 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/8">Publication of the report honours a commitment given in response to a recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures in July 2002 that more information should be made available about the implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/9">Earlier annual reports focused on the work of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. The report for 2009 is the second in which the work of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Division licensing and policy teams has also been included.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/10">As in previous years, the report explains what Home Office inspectors do and how they do it and the inspectorate's role in assessing and advising on applications for personal and project licences and certificates of designation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and reporting non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/11">The report also explains how the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Division and Inspectorate has continued to work towards delivering a better regulation programme to improve regulation of animal experimentation; reports on the successful outcome of the Hampton review of their regulatory performance conducted in 2009; and provides further information on the negotiation of a revised European directive to replace European Union Directive 86/609/EEC on which the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 is based.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Theresa May) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/2">Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/3">I regret to inform the House that there was an inaccuracy in the information given in the Statement entitled Control Order Powers (<phrase class="date" code="2010-03-11">11 March 2010</phrase>-<phrase class="date" code="2010-06-10">10 June 2010</phrase>) and laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-21">21 June 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/4">The Statement reports that 10 of the 12 individuals subject to a control order as of <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-10">10 June 2010</phrase> were British citizens. The correct figure was that nine of the 12 individuals subject to a control order were British citizens.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Climate Change (Greg Barker) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/2">I would like to inform the House that a Written Answer I gave on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-06">6 July 2010</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-07-06.147"><I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 147-8</phrase> W) to the honourable Member for Hartlepool, was incorrect. The honourable Member's Question tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-02">2 July 2010</phrase> asked what the address is of the head office of each non-departmental public body for which his department is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/3">In my Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-06">6 July 2010</phrase>, I provided a list of NDPBs that referred to both the Office for Nuclear Development (OND) and the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA).</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/4">The entry that read, &quot;Office for Nuclear Development: Area 3D, 3 Whitehall Place, London, SW1A 2AW&quot;, should have read, &quot;Nuclear Liabilities Financing Assurance Board: Area 3D, 3 Whitehall Place, London, SW1A 2AW&quot;. The inclusion of OND was due to OND's role in providing the secretariat for the NLFAB.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.3/5">The list included the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (GEMA). GEMA is not a non-departmental public body, but rather it is a non-ministerial government department.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.3/1">The Answer I provided to a supplementary question raised by Lord Howarth of Newport in relation to Lord James of Blackheath's starred Question on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-07-05.2"><I>Official Report</I>, cols. 2-5</phrase>) relating to the level of coverage of onshore wind farms, was incorrect. It referred to 14 gigawatts (GW) of onshore wind turbines that had been approved under the previous Government and stated that 70 per cent of these were &quot;already underway&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/2">The 14 GW figure refers to the amount of onshore wind that, according to modelling for one scenario, we would need in order to help meet our renewable energy targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/3">The corrected answer is as below:</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/4">Modelling for one scenario suggests that we would need a total of 14 GW of onshore wind (and 12.5 GW offshore) to help meet our 2020 targets. In the case of onshore wind, 3.5 GW has already been built, with a further 5 GW consented or under construction and 7.6 GW in the planning system. On this basis, much of the onshore capacity needed to achieve this scenario is operating or in the pipeline (if it were all built).</p>
	<p pid="a.142.3/5">All applications for wind farms, both on and offshore, have to be approved by the appropriate planning authority. Wind farms can be, and are, refused by consenting bodies on the basis of unacceptable environmental impacts, including where those impacts are the result of cumulative effects of a number of wind farm sites.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Maria Miller) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/2">Today the Government are reaffirming their clear commitment to disabled people by launching a new programme to provide support for severely disabled people. The new programme, currently called Work Choice, will be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-25">25 October 2010</phrase>. It will sit alongside the work programme and will help into work disabled people who face the most complex and long-term barriers to employment and who may require high intensity support in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/3">Nearly half of all disabled people work and many more want to work but have not had the right support. Work Choice will provide that support for more severely disabled people who want to move into employment. It will replace the existing confusing array of DWP specialist disability employment provision (WORKSTEP, Work Preparation and the Job Introduction Scheme) across England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/4">Work Choice will greatly improve upon the effectiveness of current provision by tailoring support to the needs of each severely disabled individual to help move them into and stay in long-term sustainable jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/5">Reform in this sector is long overdue. In the past, provision has been patchy with a fragmented network of providers. Work Choice will simplify the current overlapping set of programmes and will reduce the number of provider contracts from more than 200 to just 28.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/6">Work Choice has been developed in close consultation with providers, disability groups and disabled people and has widespread support.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/7">Work has been ongoing since the coalition Government took office to ensure continuity of support. We are making this announcement now to ensure that all providers are able to prepare fully to deliver the programme from October.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.3/8">We will now proceed to contract with the successful bidders for the Work Choice programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Andrew Lansley) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/2">In 2008, Professor Sir Mike Richards, National Clinical Director for Cancer, was asked to lead a review of the extent and causes of international variations in drug usage and provide a report. Professor Richards' report has been in the Library and copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/3">I would like to thank Professor Richards and his advisory group for their work on the report. They have undertaken a thorough review, which represents the most comprehensive analysis yet of the extent and potential causes of international variations in medicines usage.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/4">The report explores the extent and causes of international variations in drug usage across 14 countries, including the United Kingdom, for a range of conditions and diseases. The report indicates that there are wide international variations in usage of most of the drugs included in the study. Although a few countries emerge as generally high or low users, there does not appear to be a uniform pattern across disease areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/5">As with most of the countries studied, usage levels in the UK appear mixed when looking across the range of conditions. It does however show high levels of use in some important areas, for example of lipid regulating drugs which are helping to prevent many deaths from cardio-vascular disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/6">One of the more concerning findings in the report relates to our usage of newer cancer drugs, which lags behind that of most of the countries studied. The findings in this report make it even more important that Government do everything they can to remove barriers to doctors prescribing the cancer drugs they think will help their NHS patients. In the medium term, our plans to introduce value-based medicines pricing in 2014, on expiry of the current Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, will allow Government to take the initiative on access to new medicines. We will make new medicines available to NHS patients at a price that represents their value, rather than being restricted to recommending against the use of a new drug in the NHS due to the price its manufacturer sets.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/7">However, we also need to act to improve access to these drugs in the meantime. As an interim measure, the coalition agreement set out our plans to establish a cancer drugs fund from April 2011, subject to the spending review outcome. The need for this fund is clearly supported by Professor Richards' findings, and we will be consulting on our plans for the fund later in the year. But the report underlines the need for action now to help NHS patients access the cancer drugs their doctors think will benefit them.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/8">I am therefore announcing today additional funding of &#163;50 million for this financial year to support improved access to cancer drugs. This funding, which has been found from a review of Department of Health central budgets, will be made available through clinically led regional panels from October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/9">This Government are committed to ensuring that cancer patients no longer have to worry about whether they will be able to get the cancer drugs their doctors recommend from the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Paul Burstow) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.1/2">I will be announcing shortly the second wave of National Health Service organisations that will join the department's &quot;right to request&quot; social enterprise scheme. Details will be placed in the Library when available.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.1/3">The &quot;right to request&quot; gives all primary and community care staff employed by primary care trusts (PCTs) the right to put a request to their PCT board to set up a social enterprise to deliver health and social care services. Each of these organisations has received the approval of their PCT and strategic health authority (SHA) to pursue plans to set up a social enterprise. With appropriate support, these projects should go on to become successful and financially viable social enterprises that strengthen the delivery of tailored health and social care services in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.1/4">The projects include a wide range of health and social care services, including those for children, young people and adults, and end-of-life, mental health and disability services. They range from single service lines to whole-provider arms.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.1/5">This announcement is part of the ambition set out in <I>Equity and Excellence: </I><I>L</I><I>iberating the </I><I>NHS</I>, &quot;to create the largest and most vibrant social enterprise sector in the world&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.1/6">The initiative to encourage and support social enterprises to deliver public services is the first of its kind in the world. The scheme empowers staff to harness their entrepreneurial skills and exercise leadership to improve services for local communities through social enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.1/7">I am committed to supporting the creation and expansion of mutuals, co-operatives, charities and social enterprises and want to enable these groups to have much greater involvement in the running of health and social care services.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government (Grant Shapps) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/2">The coalition programme sets out this Government's ambitions for a low-carbon and eco-friendly economy, and to be the greenest Government ever. Substantial and cost effective reductions in carbon emissions from buildings will be an essential part of our effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/3">Much of that reduction will come from retrofitting the existing housing stock, but new-build homes will need to play an important part. The coalition programme commits to continuous improvements in the energy efficiency of new housing. We need to make sure that our homes in future are cleaner, greener and cheaper to run from the outset. We must also meet the challenge to build more homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/4">We will therefore ensure that from 2016 new homes need not add extra carbon to the atmosphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/5">Our approach will balance mitigating the impact of new development in carbon terms against the viability of that development. This will involve a flexible approach which sets an ambitious level of energy efficiency and carbon compliance measures in building regulations, and enables developers and local authorities, working together, to achieve zero carbon. The role of local authorities is central in achieving real reductions in carbon emissions, and we will ensure that they will have their say when it comes to delivering zero-carbon homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/6">I am announcing today some important further steps on the route to zero carbon.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/7">First, I can confirm that we will introduce the minimum standard for fabric energy efficiency based on that set out in the recent consultation on the Code for Sustainable Homes. We will take this forward in the future revisions of Part L of the building regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/8">Secondly, we will set a national benchmark carbon compliance standard in building regulations. I will need to be realistic and take account of costs. The Government recognise the challenges posed by the 70 per cent level previously proposed and the case for this needs to be re-examined. Therefore I am commissioning more work from the Zero Carbon Hub to test what would be an appropriate level. I have asked the hub to report back on this as early as they can.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/9">There has been considerable interest in giving developers the option to meet their further obligations through payments to fund local energy projects, possibly via an existing local tariff mechanism. We intend to explore the feasibility of this option over the coming months, including how the use of such funds for carbon abatement could complement the delivery of other types of infrastructure. We intend to ensure that local authorities have a prominent role in the design and delivery of funds that may be made available through any payment mechanism. We will work with local authorities and the housebuilding industry to establish the precise details of any potential approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/10">To respond to these challenging new standards, industry will need to develop innovative and better integrated design and building methods and technologies; methods which will not only enable them to build new and better homes, but which will make our construction industries more competitive internationally in the coming years. To support these efforts, we will continue to work closely with industry through bodies such as the Zero Carbon Hub and I can confirm that we have made an allocation of &#163;600,000 for this year to support the hub's work. We will also work with housebuilders to assist them in complying with these standards, and those charged with ensuring there is compliance, to ensure that energy and carbon savings are obtained.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.3/11">This Government are committed to ensuring that all new homes post 2016 can be zero carbon whilst ensuring that the costs of new build do not prevent appropriate and sustainable development.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.1/1">The annual reports of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner (Sir Christopher Rose) (HC 168), the Interception of Communications Commissioner (Sir Paul Kennedy) (HC 341), and the Intelligence Services Commissioner (Sir Peter Gibson) (HC 342) have today been laid before both Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/2">There is, rightly, a considerable level of public interest in the use by public authorities of covert intelligence gathering techniques. The Government are committed to ensuring that public authorities only use these powers when it is necessary and proportionate to do so. The commissioners play an important role in monitoring the use of these powers by public authorities, and ensuring compliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/3">It is regrettable that systematic failings have been noted by the Interception of Communications Commissioner in some prison establishments, and that a small number of errors have occurred elsewhere. As the commissioners themselves make clear, the details of these incidents cannot be disclosed publicly for security reasons. Following the practice of many years, my right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for the Home Department, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Northern Ireland and Defence have been provided by the commissioners with a detailed description of and explanation for these errors. The Government are satisfied that appropriate action has been taken to address these failings.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/4">I extend my thanks to Sir Christopher, Sir Paul and Sir Peter, and to their staff, for their work on these reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State (David Lidington) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/2">I welcome the delivery of the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) Advisory Opinion on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-22">22 July</phrase> on the accordance with international law of the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/3">The ICJ decided, by 10 votes to 4, that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate international law. In coming to this opinion, the ICJ considered general international law, UN Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the Kosovo constitutional framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/4">The Government are a strong supporter of Kosovo's independence. The United Kingdom submitted arguments to the ICJ in support of the conclusion which the court eventually reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/5">The Milosevic regime's campaign of ethnic cleansing in 1999, which led to the forced exile in neighbouring countries of around half the entire Kosovo Albanian population, with thousands of deaths and other acts of brutal violence at the hands of Serbian forces, meant that Kosovo could never again be integrated back into Serbia. Kosovo has been functioning as an independent state for two and a half years and the UK holds firm in its conviction that Kosovo, as a sovereign state defined by its existing borders, is a positive force for stability in the western Balkans.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/6">Despite differences over Kosovo's status, EU member states agree about the next steps. Kosovo's and Serbia's long-term futures are in the EU. All EU member states are backing Baroness Ashton's offer to facilitate talks on matters of practical co-operation between Kosovo and Serbia. This will help both countries to take steps together which will improve the lives of ordinary people of all communities and to move them towards their EU future. The Government have made it absolutely clear that any attempt to encourage the partition of Kosovo or re-open status talks threatens stability in the entire Balkans region and will be strongly resisted. We believe that the opinion's publication should mark an end to discussions on Kosovo's status.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/7">The Government will continue to lobby for further recognitions for Kosovo. We believe that the ICJ opinion will encourage those states who have not yet done so to recognise Kosovo.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has today made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/2">The Government's decision to cancel the &#163;80 million loan for a new 15,000 tonne press that had been conditionally offered to Sheffield Forgemasters by the last Government was taken on the grounds of affordability. Sheffield Forgemasters is a great British company with a dedicated, highly-skilled workforce and a strong senior management team. The Government's decision is no reflection on the company's staff, directors or this particular project.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/3">It is a worthwhile project, but when the coalition Government came into office they discovered that the previous administration had allocated too much money across government. In total, the previous Government approved &#163;34 billion of new spending commitments between <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> and the general election. It was therefore necessary to seek additional savings of &#163;6 billion in this financial year. This meant that Ministers across the whole of government had to take a number of very difficult decisions: cancelling the loan for a new 15,000 tonne press that had been offered to Sheffield Forgemasters was one such decision. The cancellation of the loan has not led to redundancies. In fact, the company continues to prosper.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/4">Although the question of equity dilution had no bearing on the decision not to proceed with the loan to Forgemasters, comments made by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have been queried and I therefore wish to explain the position.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/5">When giving oral evidence to the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20 July 2010</phrase>, I explained that there is an inherent problem with a relatively small company taking on a very big project. If the company finances the project with a large amount of debt it is likely to become so highly geared that its long-term viability is put at risk. If it funds the project with third party equity, existing shareholders have to dilute their shareholding. This is not a criticism of the company, its shareholders or the project; it is simply a statement of the problem and it is something that the chief executive of Sheffield Forgemasters, Graham Honeyman, raised in an interview with the Yorkshire Post on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-17">17 June 2010</phrase> when he made the following points:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/6">&quot;Private equity would take the whole of the shareholding away from Forgemasters and put it in the hands of somebody else. That's not just my shares (49 per cent) or the other directors, 65 per cent of the shop floor own the shares in the company. The amount of money to put in to fund the press would more or less have to absorb the whole of the shareholding.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/7">The reason why we went to the government is the interest rates were reasonable. Bank interest rates are very high therefore we would have to make huge profits every year in order just to pay off interest on the debt. This is why we needed support from the government&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/8">It is this dilution that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister were referring to when they spoke in the House. The chief executive of Sheffield Forgemasters has confirmed that he is prepared to dilute his shareholding in the company in order to facilitate the project. However, it has also been clear that the shareholders would seek a fair price for any equity sale, and at this time their view is that their returns from growing the business organically are likely to exceed those from undertaking the 15,000 tonne press project if the purchase of the press was financed by substantial equity dilution.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/9">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20 July</phrase>, Sheffield Forgemasters issued a statement in which the company said:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/10">&quot;We are still keen to undertake the 15,000 tonne press development but feel that the company's best interests will be served by suspending work on the project for the time being. The opportunities in global nuclear will continue to grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/11">This pause will give the company, which has invested more than two years and significant funds to this project, time to resume a greater focus on growing our business into civil nuclear and other sectors. We will continue to pursue other development opportunities based around our 10,000 tonne and 4,000 tonne forging presses and our recently completed programme of machine shop improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/12">As our thinking develops we will of course take up the Government's offer of further discussions. The company recognises the difficult financial position faced by the country and accepts the loan offer will not be reinstated&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/13">The Government understand this decision and the company's desire to focus on other projects. We have made clear that we stand ready to work closely with the company as it pursues its ambitions and we are willing to look carefully at all proposals, as we would for any project, when the future availability of public funds becomes clearer after the completion of the spending review.</p>
