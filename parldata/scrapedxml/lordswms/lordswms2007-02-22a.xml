<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-02-22a.95.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="95"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70222-wms0001.htm#07022254000017">
	<p pid="a.95.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.3/2">In my Oral Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November 2006</phrase>, I announced that, where full payments under the 2006 single payment scheme (SPS) were not possible in the early part of 2007, partial payments for not less than 50 per cent of claim value would start in mid-February for eligible claims above &euro;1,000. The process was expected to take around three weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.3/3">I can confirm that, after successful testing, full payments began in January 2007, with a total of 40,697 such payments, at a value of &pound;285.85 million, made to date. Last week, partial payments began, and 43,270 partial payments, with a value of &pound;633.28 million, have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.3/4">The combination of these full and partial payments has resulted in a total of &pound;919.13 million, representing 59 per cent of the estimated total fund of &pound;1.54 billion, going to 83,967 claimants (77 per cent).</p>
	<p pid="a.95.3/5">In combination with making partial payments to the small number of eligible claimants who have yet to receive one, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) will now resume full payments and begin top-up payments where a partial payment has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.3/6">The claims that have yet to receive a full payment tend to be the more complex ones and require greater manual processing by RPA staff. Along with the fact that, in some cases, action on 2005 claims will need to be completed first, this presents continuing challenges for the RPA as it works towards meeting its target of making 96.14 per cent of valid 2006 claims (by value) by <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. This means that, while I would expect a steady flow of payments over the coming months, the pace will vary from week to week.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.3/7">The current position is that some 87 SPS 2005 claims had not received any payment and 92 claimants were awaiting their balance payment, having already received a partial payment. That is roughly equivalent to the position that applied at a similar stage under the old common agricultural policy (CAP) schemes. The RPA continues to try to complete action on these claims and is reviewing the possible need to adjust SPS entitlement details notified to claimants. Adjustments have been made for some 8,000 claimants to date and approximately 25,000 cases are under review. Due to the difficulties experienced during the introduction of the scheme, further cases requiring review continue to come to light, and dedicated teams are taking this work forward. In order to protect the 2006 payment timetable as far as possible, only those adjustments estimated to be above &euro;100 will be actioned before the 2006 payments are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.3/8">Looking ahead, plans are well advanced for the 2007 scheme, with application forms, containing a greater degree of pre-population than in the past two years, expected to be dispatched during March.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.3/9">I would like to place on record my thanks both for the continued patience of the farming industry as we strive to improve delivery of the SPS and rebuild confidence in the RPA and for the staff of the agency for their hard work and commitment to making sure that this happens. I will continue to keep the House informed of progress.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-02-22a.97.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="97"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70222-wms0001.htm#07022254000035">
	<p pid="a.97.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan Ryan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/2">In November 2006, officials and the police service brought to Ministers' attention an issue of which they had just been notified by the Forensic Science Service (FSS) on the use of a specialist DNA analysis technique known as low copy number (LCN), which the FSS has used in a proportion of cases since 2000. The technique is designed to enable a DNA profile to be obtained from much smaller amounts of material than was previously possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/3">Within 24 hours of becoming aware of this issue, I agreed that the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) should set up a &quot;Gold Group&quot; to undertake an operational review of current forensic practices involving this technique, take any remedial action and establish whether there are any cases that might need reinvestigation. On operational advice from the police, the initial stage of this operation was kept confidential.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/4">My top priority was to ensure that the methods now in use meet the necessary standards. Chief Constable Tony Lake, the ACPO lead on forensics, was appointed to run the review and put together a team of experts: scientists, police and others with specialist knowledge of the issues, including an independent DNA expert. CC Lake's first priority was to ensure that current processes in use by forensic suppliers were adequate for their purpose. ACPO is close to completing that work and has found no evidence that we should be concerned about procedures being used today.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/5">His second priority is for the police and the FSS to identify cases where there might be benefit in reanalysis. The CC is now moving to this next phase, which is to inform forces and provide them with the information required to assess which should be prioritized; therefore, CC Lake wrote to all chief officers yesterday to explain the next steps in taking forward a co-ordinated programme of reanalysis. It is a complex, scientific process that is time- and labour-intensive and, depending on the number of cases identified, will take months rather than weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/6">We need to establish what lessons can be learnt from the handling of this issue within the FSS. I have asked for a report from the FSS on how this issue arose, how it was handled and the lessons to be learnt for the future operation of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.3/7">ACPO has kept Ministers regularly updated on progress and will continue to do so. I will keep the House updated on substantive progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/2">I have today published a consultation paper setting out the Government's proposals for implementing the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="">17 May 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/3">The RTFO will require that 5 per cent of all UK road transport fuel comes from a renewable source by 2010 in order to help meet our climate change objectives. The energy review and climate change programme review in 2006 committed the Government to consulting on the details of the scheme in early 2007. The consultation seeks views on the following issues:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/4">the detailed design of the scheme and which suppliers will be affected;how suppliers of renewable fuel would report on the carbon savings and wider impacts of those fuels; andhow the RTFO might develop over time and the nature and level of the obligation after 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.3/5">Further information is available from the departmental website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/">www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/</a>.</p>
