	Commissioner for Standards
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-05-25a.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100067" speakername="Lord Brabazon of Tara" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100525-wms0001.htm#1005256000003">
	<p pid="a.1.1/1">I have today tabled a Motion inviting the House to approve the appointment of Paul Kernaghan CBE QPM, former Chief Constable of Hampshire, as Commissioner for Standards for the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">The Motion will be taken in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-02">Wednesday 2 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">The report of the Leader's Group on the Code of Conduct (the Eames Group) recommended the appointment of a Lords' Commissioner for Standards, and such an appointment is provided for in paragraph 16 of the new Code of Conduct which was agreed by the House on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November</phrase> and which came into effect at the beginning of the current Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-18">18 May</phrase>. The role of the Commissioner is to investigate alleged breaches of the code including the rules governing Members' financial support or the use of parliamentary facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/4">Recruitment to the Office of Lords' Commissioner proceeded by way of an open competition. A number of candidates were interviewed by a board, which included two external members and was chaired by Baroness Fritchie, a former Commissioner for Public Appointments. A smaller number were subsequently interviewed by a further board, comprising the Leaders of the three main parties or their representatives and the Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers, chaired by the Lord Speaker. This board unanimously recommended the appointment of Mr Kernaghan. The appointment will be for an initial period of three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/5">I have today placed a copy of Mr Kernaghan's CV in the Library.</p>
