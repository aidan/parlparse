	<p pid="a.69.1/1">The Administration and Works Committee, at its meeting in November, decided that the building acquired for the House at 13 Little College Street, and formerly known as &quot;Fielden House&quot;, should be renamed &quot;Abingdon House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">The project to renovate the building has been completed on time and within budget, and will be ready for occupation for the return of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-10">10 January 2005</phrase>. The building will help to relieve the growing pressure on accommodation: it is currently expected to accommodate 63 Members together with eight Members' staff, and will also contain three new meeting rooms. The broad allocation of rooms between the parties and the Cross-Benchers has been agreed by the Accommodation Steering Group.</p>
