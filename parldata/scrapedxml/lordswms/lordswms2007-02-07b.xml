	Data Protection
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-02-07b.41.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="41"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70207-wms0001.htm#07020747000006">
	<p pid="b.41.1/1">I have today published the Government response to the consultation paper <I>Increasing penalties for deliberate and wilful misuse of personal data</I> (C/P 9/06), which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase>. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It will also be made available on the Department for Constitutional Affairs website.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/2">The response sets out how we will reform Section 60 of the Data Protection Act 1998 to ensure that there is robust protection for personal data, and to strengthen individuals' rights to privacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/3">The consultation paper sought views on whether the proposed custodial penalties &mdash;a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment on summary conviction and two years on indictment&mdash;would act as an effective deterrent to those who deliberately or recklessly misuse personal information. The Information Commissioner's report, <I>What Price Privacy?</I><I>The unlawful trade in confidential personal information</I>, highlighted the extent of the illegal trade in personal information and recommended custodial sentences for offences relating to the misuse of personal data. The Government believe that the existing financial penalties are not sufficiently protecting people's personal data.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/4">The consultation period closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October 2006</phrase>. The majority of responses welcomed the introduction of custodial penalties to provide a larger deterrence to potential offenders, to provide public reassurance that offenders would receive the appropriate sentence and to achieve parity with a number of disparate pieces of legislation which, deal with similar types of offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/5">Our reforms to the Data Protection Act fit squarely within the Government's wider strategy on data sharing. As the Government move to an era of greater data sharing&mdash;to deliver better, more customer-focused services and to protect the security of both individuals and society as a whole&mdash;it is essential for people to be confident that their personal data will not be wilfully or recklessly abused.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/6">Greater data sharing and proper respect for individual privacy are compatible. One of the essential ways of maintaining that compatibility is to ensure the security and integrity of personal data once they have been shared.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/7">In summary, following careful consideration of the responses received, we are proceeding with the proposals to introduce custodial penalties to Section 60 of the Data Protection Act. The Government are clear that custodial penalties will be reserved for the most serious breaches of the Act. We will seek to introduce an amendment to the Act as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Science and Innovation (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/2">I have today given my approval for National Grid to construct a 196-kilometre gas pipeline from Felindre near Swansea to Tirley in Gloucestershire.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/3">In making my decision, I took into account the stringent requirements that have to be met when a major development is proposed in a national park. In this instance, part of the pipeline crosses the Brecon Beacons National Park and I have decided that the pipeline satisfies the criteria that such development should be in the national interest and that there is no other practicable route. I have also included stringent conditions to reduce and mitigate any impact on the park.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.5/1">My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.5/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-11">11 January</phrase> informed Parliament of the unanimous adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737. The binding resolution calls on all member states to impose sanctions aimed at restricting Iran's ability to develop nuclear and missile technologies which could be used in a weapons programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.5/3">The Government are today seeking the agreement of the Privy Council for the adoption of Orders in Council concerned with giving effect to the financial sanctions against Iran's nuclear programme as required by UNSCR 1737 and implementing UNSCR 1737 in the UK's overseas territories. The Government are strongly supportive of international efforts in tackling abuse of financial systems and these actions are further evidence of this.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.5/4">Consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions and with other financial sanctions legislation, the Orders in Council include provisions to allow licensed exemptions to the restrictions to meet legitimate humanitarian needs.</p>
