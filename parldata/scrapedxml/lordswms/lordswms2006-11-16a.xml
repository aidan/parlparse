	<p pid="a.3.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">With the expiry of the call-out order made last November, a new order has been made under Section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to enable reservists to continue to be called out into service to support operations in Afghanistan. The new order is effective until <phrase class="date" code="">11 November 2007</phrase>. Reservists are making a valuable contribution to operations in that country. Some 380 reservists are currently called out in support of the operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/2">The money, available next year, will help local authorities enhance the physical environment of care homes providing nursing or personal care to older people. This focused support will help older people living in care homes do so with dignity and will enable care homes to be more responsive to the needs of older residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/3">A good environment can support dignity and help people feel that they are being treated with respect. Even small enhancements can have a positive impact on well-being. I hope that local authorities, care home providers and their residents will work together to find innovative ways of using this additional money to deliver higher standards of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/4">I announced this funding at the launch of the Dignity in Care campaign, through which I aim to stimulate a country-wide debate about the importance of care services respecting the dignity of those who use them.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/5">At the campaign launch, I invited people to join me in taking up the dignity challenge. The challenge is a clear statement of what people can expect from a service that respects dignity, backed up by &quot;dignity tests&quot; that can be used by services to see how they measure up.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/6">I also invited people to join a new network of local champions of dignity charged with challenging poor practice and raising the profile of dignity in care locally. Support for the champions and service providers will be available in the form of an online practice guide and a programme of service improvement and network support to be delivered regionally. Other aspects of the campaign include working with Investors in People UK to help us to ensure that staff themselves are treated with dignity and respect, and a commitment from the health and social care regulators to take forward this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/7">More details about the Dignity in Care campaign, the dignity challenge and how to join the champions' network can be found at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/dignityincare">www.dh.gov.uk/dignityincare</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/3">The Green Paper was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-17">17 July 2006</phrase> and invited views from stakeholders and the public on a comprehensive package of new measures that the Government believe will provide important new tools to assist the authorities in tackling organised criminality more effectively. The proposals included:</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/4">Establishing a civil prevention order to be used against individuals and organisations to prevent serious crime.Improving data-sharing within the public sector and between the private and public sectors so that financial crime may be more easily detected and prevented.Introducing new offences of assisting and encouraging crime so that those on the margins of crime can be brought to justice more easily.Amending the proceeds of crime legislation to bolster our ability to recover ill-gotten gains.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/5">During its three-month consultation period, the Green Paper generated more than 100 responses, summaries of which will be published tomorrow. The majority of responses received were overwhelmingly supportive of the proposals. As a result, the Government intend to introduce legislation in the coming Session of Parliament, the overall aim being to prevent the UK being an attractive option for organised criminals to operate in.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.3/6">Copies of the document, entitled <I>New Powers against Organised and Financial Crime&mdash;Summary of responses to Consultation</I>, will be available in the House of Commons Library and on the Home Office and Crime Reduction websites.</p>

The presidency sought views during the morning discussion on a draft presidency text of the directive. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the presidency and its subsequent tabling of an alternative section of text, it proved impossible to reach agreement, due to the refusal of a minority of five countries to agree any text that did not set an end date for the opt-out.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Derek Twigg) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/2">I am pleased to be able to provide further details of our plans to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Falklands conflict in June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/3">The commemorations will provide us with an opportunity to reflect on the events of 25 years ago. We will take time to remember those who gave their lives to defend the freedom of the Falkland Islands. As well as the principal events in London, Pangbourne and Stanley, we anticipate that local communities and veterans groups around the country may wish to organise their own smaller-scale events.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/4">Our relationship with Argentina has come a long way in recent years and, in addition to remembering the sacrifices of our forces, we will recognise their losses too. Our commemorations will not be triumphalist.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/5">Official events begin on Liberation Day, <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-14">Thursday 14 June</phrase>, at the Falkland Islands memorial chapel in the grounds of Pangbourne Nautical College, Berkshire. This service of commemoration and remembrance is held annually on behalf of the Falklands Families Association but will have special significance in 2007, when it will be attended by senior members of the Royal Family and carried live by the BBC.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/6">Later that day (UK time) attention will turn to the Falkland Islands and the first of a series of live link-ups with the islands. A service at Christchurch Cathedral, Stanley, will be followed by an act of commemoration at the Falklands war memorial, and British forces currently based on the islands will parade through Stanley, exercising the freedom bestowed on them by the Falkland Islands Government in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/7">The showpiece event of these commemorations will be on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-17">Sunday 17 June</phrase>. This will consist of a high-impact visual event on Horse Guards Parade followed by a march past of veterans and their modern-day service counterparts up the Mall to Buckingham Palace to witness a fly-past of aircraft from the Falklands era as well as some of those flown by the same squadrons today. Central to the event will be the personal recollections of veterans and islanders as they tell their stories in their own words.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/8">The events will be focused on the veterans and their families, and we are working closely with the South Atlantic Medal Association 82, the principal association for those involved in Operation Corporate, along with a wide range of veterans' and families' organisations. I hope that as many as possible of the campaign's veterans will be able to attend the event on Horse Guards Parade. Space in the audience will be limited, so tickets will initially be restricted to veterans (military and civilian), widows, their guests and families. Details can be found on the Veterans Agency website (<a href="http://www.veteransagency.mod.uk">www.veteransagency.mod.uk</a>) or by contacting the Veterans Agency helpline on 0800 169 2277.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.3/9">A limited number of seats for the Horse Guards event are available to honourable Members. The Speaker's Office will issue tickets in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/2">The new UK legislative programme unveiled in the Queen's Speech on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November</phrase> contains significant measures of relevance and benefit to the people of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/3">The programme demonstrates the continuing partnership between the United Kingdom and Scottish Parliaments and the Government and Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/4">The Government are committed to maintaining these close working partnerships as they continue to deliver improvements to the lives of people across Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/5">The following is a summary of the legislation announced in the Queen's Speech and its impact in Scotland. This does not include draft Bills. The Bills listed in Section 1 are likely to contain provisions that require the consent of the Scottish Parliament in line with the Sewel convention. A brief description is provided of the provisions likely to require consent. Section 2 details Bills that are not likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament as the legislation is predominantly or wholly within a reserved area or has limited impact in Scotland. The list also identifies the lead Government department:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/6"><I>Legislation likely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament at introduction.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/7">Discussions will continue between the Government and the Scottish Executive on such Bills that might include provisions in devolved areas. The Bills identified within the Queen's Speech in this section are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/8">Child Support Bill (Department for Work and Pensions): mainly reserved but may include provisions in devolved areas relating to the jurisdiction of courts and the joint registration of births (births jointly registered by both parents).</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/9">Climate Change Bill (Office of Climate Change): legislation relating to climate change is likely to include provisions in devolved areas to meet a new emissions target. The environment is a devolved matter in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/10">Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill (Department of Trade and Industry): consumer protection is reserved but the legislation will include provisions creating a new National Consumer Council and Scottish equivalent with responsibilities including food safety, which is devolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/11">Further education and training (Department For Education and Skills): education is devolved but the Bill will include provisions that give Scottish Ministers functions to make arrangements directly with the Learning and Skills Council for England in relation to career development loans and shared provision of services, i.e. procurement of goods and services and the development of information technology systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/12">Serious organised crime (Home Office): likely to include provisions in reserved and devolved areas, including recognition of prevention orders and proceeds of crime, which are devolved matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/13">Statistics and Registration Services Bill (Her Majesty's Treasury): the new statistics board's remit will extend fully across the whole of the UK. Statistics that relate to a devolved matter are considered to fall within the competence of the Scottish Parliament and will also benefit from the reforms and functions of the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/14">Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill (Department for Constitutional Affairs): this Bill will include provisions relating to the tribunals in Scotland, which are devolved. It also legislates on the devolved matter of immunity from seizure of cultural artefacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/15"><I>Legislation unlikely to contain provisions requiring the consent of the Scottish Parliament at introduction.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/16">The Bills in this section, which deal with predominantly or wholly reserved matters and matters which do not impact in Scotland, are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/17">Border and immigration (Home Office)</p>

	<p pid="a.8.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-09">9 November 2006</phrase>, my department published the NHS financial report for the second quarter of 2006-07. This report shows that the NHS as a whole is forecasting a &pound;94 million deficit for the year, after the application of a &pound;350 million contingency established by the strategic health authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">My honourable friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Tony McNulty)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-06">6 November</phrase>, the Police Arbitration Tribunal's recommendation on the police officer 2006 pay award was received. The Home Secretary responded to this recommendation, agreeing to implement the 3 per cent pay rise for police officers, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-01">1 September 2006</phrase>. The Home Secretary also noted the tribunal's comment that we not only had,</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/3" class="indent">&quot;the right but a duty to consider and put forward different factors and approaches which could be applied in determining police pay&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/4">and said that he would review how police pay is determined, including indexation, and would announce the terms of reference of the review shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/5">Effective pay arrangements for police officers are essential for a modern police service which delivers high standards of community safety and security to the public. We must move quickly to put police officer pay on a sustainable basis. We cannot continue with arrangements which produce pay rises beyond the level which police authorities can afford to pay without detriment to service delivery. For that reason, we will establish a review of the way police pay is determined, reporting early in the new year and in good time to inform the 2007 pay round. Following this, I will also ask the review body to consider further changes to the police pay negotiating machinery. In particular, I am minded to place responsibility for determining chief officer pay within the remit of the Senior Salaries Review Body. The review that I have announced will look at this as part of its consideration of the options for replacing the current police officer pay determination arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/6">I have asked Sir Clive Booth to undertake the first part of this review and I am pleased to announce that he has accepted. Sir Clive will report to me in early 2007 with recommendations on the pay determination mechanism that we should use for next year. This, along with any other proposals for pay modernisation from the service or representative organisations, will be considered in the 2007 pay round. The Home Secretary and I will consider further how the second part of the review, looking at the police negotiating machinery, should be taken forward, including consideration of John Randall's report on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/7">The terms of reference for the review are:</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/8">Part 1: to consider the options for replacing the current arrangements for determining changes to police officer pay for 2007 and make recommendations on this. The conclusions and recommendations in part 1 are to be framed so as to inform part 2 of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/9">Part 2: to review the effectiveness of the negotiating machinery for the police, including the Police Negotiating Board and the Police Staff Council, and make recommendations for how police pay and other conditions of service should be determined. The review must consider the option of a pay review body for police pay and consider the impact of any proposal for determining police officer pay on the negotiating machinery for police officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/10">Both parts of the review must take account of the need for arrangements to reflect and support the following:</p>

	<p pid="a.10.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/2">The Government are committed to tackling poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-13">13 November</phrase>, I published <I>Lifetime Opportunities&mdash;Government's Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy for Northern Ireland</I>. This follows extensive public consultation on the future direction of new targeting social need (new TSN) policy in Northern Ireland and the results of an independent evaluation of new TSN.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/4">The new strategy will aim to:</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/5">End child poverty by 2020. Based on the estimate of approximately 130,000 children in relative income poverty in 1998-99, this means lifting 65,000 children out of poverty by 2010, on the way to eradiation by 2020; andWork towards eliminating poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/6">It will retain some important elements of its predecessor new TSN, such as promoting social inclusion (PSI) and the principle of targeting resources and effort within programmes at those areas, groups and individuals in greatest objective need. Significant changes include the introduction of a new structure, based on four key life cycles highlighting the important issues impacting on a person at these different stages of their life and a goal for each highlighting what Government wish to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/7">The commitment to end child poverty is in line with the UK target of halving child poverty by 2010, with a view to eradicating child poverty by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/8">A key feature of the strategy will be the establishment of a ministerial-led inter-departmental, cross-sectoral forum to monitor progress. Subject to the establishment of a Northern Ireland Executive, it is intended that the forum will be chaired by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, David Hanson MP, who has lead responsibility for taking forward work to tackle poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/9">Copies of <I>Lifetime Opportunities</I> have been placed in the Libraries and is also available at <a href="http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/central-anti-poverty-unit">www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/central-anti-poverty-unit</a>.</p>
