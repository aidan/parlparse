	Home Detention Curfew Scheme
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-01-14a.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="25"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040114/text/40114-35.htm#40114-35_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.25.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department has today announced a change to the Home Detention Curfew Scheme (HDC).</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">HDC has been in operation since 1999. It provides an effective and measured transition for offenders moving from custody into the community. Eligible prisoners are subject to a careful risk assessment before any decision is taken to grant them early release. Previous amendments to the scheme have balanced extensions to the period of early release with restrictions designed to maintain public confidence in the scheme as a whole. In April 2003 the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department announced an extension of HDC to a maximum of four and a half months. The extension was accompanied by the introduction of a presumption against release for prisoners convicted of certain serious offences&mdash;those which the Government consider cause the public particular concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">Prisoners released under the HDC scheme serve the remainder of their custody period at home under electronic curfew, usually from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. At present there are approximately 3,700 prisoners on electronic tag. The scheme is kept under constant review.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">Public confidence in the scheme is essential. It is for this reason that the Home Secretary has already made it clear that offenders serving sentences for certain current offences and prisoners with any history of sexual offending must be considered unsuitable for release on HDC unless exceptional circumstances exist. This presumption against HDC will continue to apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">A recent case has highlighted the fact that, in addition, there will be exceptional cases where an offender may be considered unsuitable for HDC even though he or she has not committed one of the offences which give rise to the presumption, if to grant HDC would undermine public confidence in the scheme. This will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/6">The Home Secretary has decided that such exceptional cases should be referred to the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service who will take the decision whether or not to grant HDC.</p>

	Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill: County Council Amendment
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-01-14a.26.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="26"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040114/text/40114-35.htm#40114-35_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.26.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">The Government have always been clear that county councils and other authorities with strategic planning expertise would play a key part in preparing draft revisions of regional spatial strategies and in their implementation. Draft Planning Policy Statement 11, which we published for consultation in October, sets out in some detail how the county councils and these other authorities can assist the regional planning body, including exercising functions on behalf of that body within a partnership arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/3">The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill already encourages regional planning bodies to enter into arrangements with county councils and these other authorities but it does not require them to do so. The Local Government Association, the County Councils Network and others have expressed concern that, without a guarantee of involvement for county councils on the face of the Bill, their role could be marginalised under the new arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/4">I have discussed with the association and the County Councils Network how we might secure in legislation our policy intention for the future role of county councils without creating unnecessary bureaucracy or providing opportunities for unreasonable delay or obstruction. 1 am pleased to announce to the House that, as a result of these discussions, we will be tabling an amendment to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill which is currently in the House of Lords. Whether or not the Bill is amended is ultimately a matter for that House to decide.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/5">This amendment would require regional planning bodies to seek advice on the preparation, review and monitoring the implementation of regional spatial strategies from county councils and other authorities with strategic planning expertise. They would in turn be under an obligation to provide advice, providing that their delivery of services was affected in some way. 1 would also amend our draft Planning Policy Statement No 11 on Regional Planning to explain in more detail how this would work in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/6">The amendment would also allow regional planning bodies to enter into arrangements with counties, other authorities with strategic planning expertise and district councils to carry out functions on behalf of the regional planning body.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/7">I am delighted that, in the light of this proposal, the Local Government Association and the County Councils Network have agreed to give their full support to making the new regional planning arrangements a success. 1 look forward to our promoting together a system that I believe will deliver better strategic plans for our regions in the years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2"><i>Creating sustainable communities: Making it Happen: Thames Gateway and the Growth Areas </i>published in July 2003 announced outline plans for a &pound;164 million package for the three newer growth areas of Ashford, Milton Keynes/South Midlands, and London/Stansted/Cambridge. Commitments were made then to fund individual schemes to a total value of &pound;88 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.1/8">Protecting and improving valuable habitats, including chalk downland at Dunstable Downs and fenland at Wicken, north of Cambridge.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/9">New footpaths and bridges to improve access to the Lee Valley Regional Park in north-east London.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/10">Key improvements to infrastructure announced today include:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/11">&pound;9.5 million for the London/Stansted/Cambridge growth area, bringing the total to over &pound;20 million. New projects will provide access to new housing sites on Cambridge's southern fringe, and will fund design and preparation work for the Cambridge to Huntingdon guided bus, recently awarded &pound;65<i> </i>million by the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/12">Over &pound;35 million for the Milton Keynes/South Midlands growth area. Flagship schemes include &pound;10.6 million for the construction of a new access road and bridge to enable early delivery of 3,400 new homes in Wellingborough and &pound;5 million for a new road at Bedford, which together with funding from the Department for Transport and English Partnerships will enable 3,450 to be provided which would not otherwise go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/13">&pound;2.8<i> </i>million for schemes to support job creation and improve the urban environment in Corby, &pound;1.7 million to improve the town centre in Aylesbury and &pound;3 million to regenerate the historic Bletchley Park complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/14">An additional &pound;4.5 million to kick start the regeneration of Ashford town centre, on top of the &pound;9 million announced in July 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/15">A further &pound;19.5 million has been set aside for further schemes in the London/Stansted/Cambridge corridor, details of which we will announce in April 2004.</p>

	National Service Framework for Renal Services
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.28.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/2">I am today publishing National Service Framework for Renal Services, Part One: Dialysis and Transplantation.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/3">The national service framework (NSF) programme is a major part of our agenda to tackle health inequalities and to drive up standards across the National Health Service. Part one of this NSF covers dialysis and transplantation. It sets standards and identifies markers of good practice that will help the NHS and its partners to manage the demand for renal services, increase fairness of access and improve choice and quality in dialysis and kidney transplantation.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/4">This is an important part of our modernisation programme to improve renal dialysis and transplantation services over the next 10 years. The framework sets out five quality standards to provide a flexible, responsive service that provides patients with better access and choice. It identifies 30 markers of good practice drawn from national and international evidence. This NSF builds on the programme of modernisation set out in the NHS Plan and the national service frameworks for diabetes, coronary heart disease, older people, and children. It reflects the principles of empowering patients and frontline staff contained in the NHS Plan and <i>Shifting the Balance of Power</i>, and of extending patient choice as set out in <i>Building on the Best: Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS</i> (Cm 6079).</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/5">This NSF complements <i>Saving Lives, Valuing Donors&mdash;A Transplant Framework for England</i> and supports our aim to increase the number of kidneys available for transplantation.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/6">The five NSF standards for renal services set out a vision of a service that is equitable and integrated and that provides people with the support they need to make individual choices and to manage their own condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/7">The NSF for renal services sets out five steps for the NHS to take by 2006:</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/8">Use national data to support planning and to identify local priorities, including the needs of black and minority ethnic groups;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/9">Continue to expand haemodialysis capacity;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/10">Join the UK renal registry and take part in national audit;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/11">Implement National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on home haemodialysis;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/12">Implement forthcoming NICE guidance on immunosuppressive therapy for transplantation.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/13">In addition we will establish five modernisation programmes to support the implementation and delivery of the NSF. These programmes are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/14">Redesign the renal dialysis and transplantation workforce;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/15">Re-engineer elective dialysis access surgery;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/16">Redesign access to hospital (patient transport);</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/17">Redesign care plans to enable partnership and choice;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/18">Redesign the built environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/19">We will continue to work with doctors, nurses, allied healthcare professionals, NHS managers and people with renal failure to develop part two of the NSF concentrating on prevention of established renal failure, primary care and care towards the end of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/20">Copies of <i>National Service Framework for Renal Services, Part One: Dialysis and Transplantation</i> have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.1/1">Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved further licences to export military list goods to Iraq. The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of &quot;arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions&quot;. Accordingly, Her Majesty's Government consider it appropriate to grant exemptions for the export of:</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">(i) smoke grenades which are to be used by private security firms contracted to provide close protection for employees of the Coalition Provisional Authority(CPA); and</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/3">(ii) small arms ammunition which is to be provided to the Coalition Provisional Authority for use by the Ministry of the Interior in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/4">These exports are consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis against the UN embargo and consolidated criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">Following consultations with this department, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry issued a licence for the export to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) of bomb disposal suits and equipment. This equipment will be used by the Royal Nepalese Army, who are part of the Ituri Brigade of the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC).</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">UN Security Council Resolution (SCR) 1493 (2003), adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-28">28 July 2003</phrase>, implemented an embargo on the provision of arms and any related materiel to all armed groups operating in the east of the country.
