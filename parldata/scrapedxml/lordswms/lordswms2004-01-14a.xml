	Home Detention Curfew Scheme
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-01-14a.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="25"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040114/text/40114-35.htm#40114-35_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.25.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department has today announced a change to the Home Detention Curfew Scheme (HDC).</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">HDC has been in operation since 1999. It provides an effective and measured transition for offenders moving from custody into the community. Eligible prisoners are subject to a careful risk assessment before any decision is taken to grant them early release. Previous amendments to the scheme have balanced extensions to the period of early release with restrictions designed to maintain public confidence in the scheme as a whole. In April 2003 the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department announced an extension of HDC to a maximum of four and a half months. The extension was accompanied by the introduction of a presumption against release for prisoners convicted of certain serious offences&mdash;those which the Government consider cause the public particular concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">Prisoners released under the HDC scheme serve the remainder of their custody period at home under electronic curfew, usually from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. At present there are approximately 3,700 prisoners on electronic tag. The scheme is kept under constant review.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">Public confidence in the scheme is essential. It is for this reason that the Home Secretary has already made it clear that offenders serving sentences for certain current offences and prisoners with any history of sexual offending must be considered unsuitable for release on HDC unless exceptional circumstances exist. This presumption against HDC will continue to apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">A recent case has highlighted the fact that, in addition, there will be exceptional cases where an offender may be considered unsuitable for HDC even though he or she has not committed one of the offences which give rise to the presumption, if to grant HDC would undermine public confidence in the scheme. This will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/6">The Home Secretary has decided that such exceptional cases should be referred to the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service who will take the decision whether or not to grant HDC.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.1/1">Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved further licences to export military list goods to Iraq. The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of &quot;arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions&quot;. Accordingly, Her Majesty's Government consider it appropriate to grant exemptions for the export of:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">(i) smoke grenades which are to be used by private security firms contracted to provide close protection for employees of the Coalition Provisional Authority(CPA); and</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/3">(ii) small arms ammunition which is to be provided to the Coalition Provisional Authority for use by the Ministry of the Interior in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/4">These exports are consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Future applications will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis against the UN embargo and consolidated criteria, taking into account the circumstances prevailing at the time.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">Following consultations with this department, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry issued a licence for the export to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) of bomb disposal suits and equipment. This equipment will be used by the Royal Nepalese Army, who are part of the Ituri Brigade of the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC).</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">UN Security Council Resolution (SCR) 1493 (2003), adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-28">28 July 2003</phrase>, implemented an embargo on the provision of arms and any related materiel to all armed groups operating in the east of the country. Operative Paragraph 21 of the SCR provides an exemption to the embargo for &quot;supplies to MONUC&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/3">The main issue for discussion was indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages, and the council has agreed a programme to take forward joint working in this area. I have placed a copy of the communique in the Libraries of the House.</p>
