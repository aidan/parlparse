	Constitutional Reform Act 2005
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-01-23a.45.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="45"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60123-47.htm#60123-47_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.45.1/1">The Government announced plans for significant constitutional reform on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June 2003</phrase>, designed to enhance the independence of the judiciary and to ensure clarity in the relationship between the executive and the judiciary. I plan shortly to introduce the required statutory instruments to bring into force those parts of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 that will deliver the central aspects of those reforms. As of <phrase class="date" code="">3 April 2006</phrase>, I intend to bring the new Judicial Appointments Commission into being and commence those aspects of the Act that give statutory effect to the provisions of the concordat I agreed with the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2" class="italic">Roles of the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="">3 April</phrase>, the Lord Chancellor's role as a judge will cease. The Lord Chief Justice will hold the additional title of President of the Courts of England and Wales and be legally recognised as the head of the judiciary in England and Wales. As set out in the concordat, the role of the Lord Chief Justice will be significantly reformed and strengthened. To support the Lord Chief Justice, the Judicial Office for England and Wales has been established and the new head of that office has recently been appointed and taken up post.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4" class="indent">&quot;In addition, to give effect to the new arrangements for the handling of judicial disciplinary matters, a new Office for Judicial Complaints will be established. The arrangements relating to judicial complaints and discipline will be published shortly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/5" class="italic">Judicial Independence and Rule of Law</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/6">As of <phrase class="date" code="">3 April</phrase>, for the first time there will be a guarantee of continued judicial independence enshrined in statute, underpinned by particular duties binding on the Lord Chancellor and Ministers of the Crown to uphold judicial independence. The Act also formally recognises the constitutional principle of the rule of law and the Lord Chancellor's role in relation to that principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/7" class="italic">Judicial Appointments Commission</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/8">As of <phrase class="date" code="">3 April 2006</phrase>, the Judicial Appointments Commission will be formally launched. The appointment of Baroness Prashar as the inaugural chair of the new commission was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October 2005</phrase>. The Queen has given effect to the following appointments:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/9" class="italic">Judicial members</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/10">Lord Justice Sir Robin Ernest Auld</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/11">Lady Justice Heather Hallett DBE</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/12">Her Honour Judge Frances Margaret Kirkham</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/13">District Judge Charles William Frank Newman</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/14" class="italic">Tribunal member</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/15">His Honour Judge David Stephen Pearl</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/16" class="italic">Lay Justice Member</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/17">Lorna May Boreland-Kelly DBE JP</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/18" class="italic">Professional Members</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/19">Mr Jonathan Philip Chadwick Sumption OBE QC</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/20">Mr Edward Nally</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/21" class="italic">Lay Members</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/22">Professor Hazel Gillian Genn CBE</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/23">Sir Geoffrey David Inkin OBE</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/24">Mr Francis John Plowden</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/25">Ms Harriet Greville Spicer</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/26">Ms Sara Catherine Nathan</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/27">The appointment of the final judicial member will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/28">The Judicial Appointments Commission will have responsibility for making selections for the appointment of all judicial office-holders (as provided for in Schedule 14 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005). Baroness Prashar, the Lord Chief Justice and I have considered the arrangements necessary to ensure that the commission can make the decisive and confident start that we are all agreed is essential. Details of these agreed arrangements have been published today on my department's website at <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/pubs/statements/st060123.htm">www.dca.gov.uk/pubs/statements/st060123.htm</a>. They will ensure that the transitional period is as short as possible, whilst bringing about a smooth and effective handover of business to the new commission.</p>

	Energy Review
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-01-23a.46.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="46"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60123-48.htm#60123-48_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.46.1/1">My right honourable friend has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/2">Further to the Statement made by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-29">29 November 2005</phrase> launching the Energy Review, I am pleased to inform the House that the Government have today launched the public phase of this review, and that I have written to all MPs to inform them of the launch.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/3">The consultation has a broad scope and will consider both energy supply and demand. The consultation reinforces the Government's commitment to the four main policy goals as set out in the 2003 Energy White Paper:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/4" class="indent">to put ourselves on a path to cut the UK's carbon dioxide emissions&mdash;the main contributor to global warming&mdash;by some 60 per cent by about 2050 with real progress made by 2020;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/5" class="indent">to maintain the reliability of energy supplies;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/6" class="indent">to promote competitive markets in the UK and beyond, helping to raise the rate of sustainable economic growth and to improve our productivity; and</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/7" class="indent">to ensure that every home is adequately and affordably heated.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/8">The consultation document sets out the energy challenges we are currently facing, and invites responses to the evidence presented as well as asking what more should be done to secure clean, affordable energy for the long term. I am keen to stimulate a wide-raging and informed debate on energy policy issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/9">I have made copies of the consultation document, <i>Our Energy Challenge: securing clean, affordable energy for the long term</i>, available in the Vote Office and the Libraries of the House. Copies and further information are also available on the Internet at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/review">www.dti.gov.uk/energy/review</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/10">The key questions posed by the consultation document are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/11">What more could the Government do on the demand or supply side to ensure that the UK's long-term goal of reducing carbon emissions is met?</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/12">With the UK becoming a net energy importer and with big investments to be made over the next 20 years in generating capacity and networks, what further steps, if any, should the Government take to develop our market framework for delivering reliable energy supplies? In particular, we invite views on the implications of increased dependence on gas imports.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/13">The Energy White Paper left open the option of nuclear new build. Are there particular considerations that should apply to nuclear, as the Government re-examine the issues bearing on the new build? If so, what are these, and how should the Government address them?</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/14">Are there particular considerations that should apply to carbon abatement and other low-carbon technologies in the context of electricity generation?</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/15">What further steps should be taken towards meeting the Government's goals for ensuring that every home is adequately and affordably heated?</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/16">Comments are also invited on:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/17" class="indent">the long term potential of energy efficiency measures in the transport, residential, business and public sectors, and how best to achieve that potential;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/18" class="indent">implications in the medium and long term for the transmission and network networks of significant new build in gas and electricity generation infrastructure;</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/19" class="indent">opportunities for more joint working with other countries on our energy policy goals; and</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/20" class="indent">potential measures to help bring forward technologies to replace fossil fuels in transport and heat generation in the medium and long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.1/21">The Government have a genuinely open mind on solutions. However, it is clear that there are no simple &quot;one-technology&quot; answers. The review will take account of the evidence gathered during the consultation when developing its proposals.</p>
