	<p pid="a.39.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/2">The Government have received and welcomed the second report from the Justice Oversight Commissioner, Lord Clyde, on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. Consistent with his terms of reference, the report was submitted to the Attorney-General, Lord Filkin, the Minister for the Northern Ireland Court Service, and me in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/3">Lord Clyde concludes that in the period of this report good progress continues to be made in the implementation of the review's recommendations on a number of fronts. While a few delays in progress have been noted, he believes that for the most part the momentum has been maintained and important initiatives have been pursued with vigour. He comments that there is now visible evidence which demonstrates the progress which is being made and provides promise of the eventual implementation of the changes recommended in the criminal justice review. The Government warmly endorse these conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/4">Copies of the commissioner's report have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase> I announced the establishment of three public inquiries, into the deaths of Robert Hamill, Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson. I will be publishing a report today setting out the principles that will govern these inquiries and the progress made in establishing them. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/3">These inquiries are being established because it is essential that all people in Northern Ireland can have confidence in the integrity of the state and its institutions. Where there are serious allegations of wrongdoing, it is important that the facts are properly established. The Government will continue to press ahead with the detailed arrangements for the inquiries, including the appointment of chairmen, as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.5/4">As I have said previously, it is also important that we find a way in Northern Ireland of dealing with the past in a way that recognises the pain associated with it without allowing it to destroy all hope of a better future. Throughout the summer, I will be considering the options for doing this, taking on board the views of a range of experts, with a view to wider consultation in the autumn.</p>

	Northern Ireland Regional Development Strategy 2025: Annual Report 2002&ndash;03
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-07-08a.40.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="40"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040708/text/40708-49.htm#40708-49_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.40.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/2">Earlier today I placed in the Libraries copies of the annual report on the implementation of the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland 2025 (RDS) covering the period 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/3">Annual reporting on the implementation of the RDS involves assessment of progress being made against a number of critical threshold indicators and each of the strategic planning guidelines (SPGs) contained within the strategy. Measuring the relevant outcomes assesses progress against each of the SPGs. To measure these outcomes data are collected from government departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/4">The monitoring section of the annual report covering the period 2002&ndash;03 deals with measured outcomes against each of the SPGs for that period. It is my intention however to publish a further report in November 2004 that will bring reporting up-to-date since September 2001. The November report (thereafter published biennially) will comment on measured outcomes up to March 2004, and will deal in more detail with any key trends which have emerged over the three-year period since September 2001. This will be important in the context of the work that the department has commenced on the 2005&ndash;06 focussed assessment of the RDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/5">Earlier in the year I committed to a review of the regional housing allocations. A three-month consultation exercise commenced in May 2004. The work is in two stages. First, it will involve an assessment of household formation. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency on behalf of the department is taking this work forward. This may result in a revised regional housing figure. Consideration will also have to be given to factors such as vacancy, second homes and housing stock loss.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/6">The second stage will include an assessment of the appropriate level of housing allocation for district councils. This will take account of local factors that impact on housing need and any changed circumstances since the original figures were prepared. Given the complexity and sensitivity of projecting housing need, consideration will be given to how these figures are used. The outcome from the housing review process will be fed into the focused assessment. It is possible that this review of housing allocation figures will point to the need for a specific adjustment of the RDS rather than action by third parties. The focused assessment process will provide the opportunity for necessary publicity and consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/7">The focused assessment will require consideration of all strategic guidance within the RDS using up-to-date data in the context of current government policy. However, the focused assessment is not a full review. Any adjustments will be considered in the context of the guiding principles and the strategic direction that is set out in the spatial development strategy. The focused assessment process will also include open and participative engagement with stakeholders and consultation as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/8">The success of the RDS will be determined by the extent to which its policies and actions are implemented. Implementation is, however, a very complex process involving a wide variety of public and private organisations, businesses, voluntary and community organisations and individuals. Many of the policies can be implemented only through individual departments and their strategies. Chapter 13 of the RDS sets out the elements of the delivery mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/9">However the department has been heavily engaged in developing the participative approach to implementation by engaging a wide range of stakeholders in the public and private sectors and in the community. During the year 2003&ndash;04 the department has facilitated a series of sub-regional seminars for the north-west, the south-east, the rural west and the north-west. Reports of proceedings in these events will be published as a record of the action agenda proposed for each sub-region. The department is now engaged with representatives of the organisations attending the seminars to agree a suitable structure for continuing engagement in tracking RDS progress and local strategic priorities.</p>

	Iraq: Central Criminal Court

	<p pid="a.41.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Geoffrey Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">Honourable Members will recall the harrowing images broadcast by Al Jazeera television in March last year, which showed the bodies of two British soldiers&mdash;Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth and Sapper Luke Allsopp. There were indications that one or both of the soldiers may not have died in combat, and as a result we launched a Special Investigation Branch inquiry. Although it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the evidence collected so far, it continues to point to the possibility that one or both soldiers may have been murdered.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/3">Honourable Members may also recall the tragic deaths of six RMP soldiers in Al Majarr Al Kabir last June. Against the backdrop of an extremely challenging environment, an SIB investigation into that incident has also been making progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/4">Last year, the Coalition Provisional Authority established the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) to exercise jurisdiction over all criminal offences referred to it by the administration in Iraq, which were committed there since <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-19">19 March 2003</phrase>. The CCCI follows the investigative model, prevalent in the rest of Europe, whereby an investigative court directs and oversees the investigation and, where appropriate, refers the matter to a trial court.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/5">If these cases are to be pursued through the CCCI, then it is important that the concluding phases of the investigations are conducted under the court's direction, to ensure compliance with the rules and procedures of the court. This will have particular impact in respect of the admissibility of evidence. I have therefore agreed that it would be appropriate for the CCCI to be invited to take on these cases. To that end, translations of the cases developed so far have been passed to the CCCI. If the CCCI adopts the cases, we will, of course, support it in any way we can in taking the investigations forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/6">The CCCI represents the best prospect of dealing with such cases in an expeditious and fair manner, as Iraqi law has a bar to extraditing its own nationals to a foreign state, including the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/7">Whatever the outcome of these cases, I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of the SIB senior investigating officers and their teams for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/8">The families of the eight soldiers are being kept informed of progress with the investigations. Our thoughts and sympathies remain with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.1/8">6. To make a progressive reduction in the unit costs for bills of at least 4 per cent by March 2005, over the 2003&ndash;04 baseline.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-10">10 July 2003</phrase> the Government published the consultation paper, <i>Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change</i>. This set out our proposals to reform civil registration in England and Wales using powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. It remains our intention, as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-29">29 March</phrase> this year, to bring forward two orders under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. One, planned for this Session of Parliament, will amend the current legislation on birth and death registration. The second, on marriage law, has been deferred to enable us to take into account Parliament's wishes on civil partnership legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/2">Preliminary consideration of the responses to <i>Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change</i> suggests that there is an issue regarding the proposals for marriage on which there should be further consultation. The issue concerns the absence of any proposal to change the legal requirement for marriage ceremonies to be either civil or religious. Policy in this area of marriage law is the responsibility of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In the coming months and in consultation with others, we will be working with Treasury Ministers and the General Register Office for England and Wales to determine the scope of any revised proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/2">The UK Government scheme to pay compensation to victims of Nazi persecution whose property was confiscated during the Second World War under the trading with the enemy legislation will close on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-31">31 August 2004</phrase>. Lord Archer of Sandwell, the chairman of the Enemy Property Claims Assessment Panel, has reported to me that the panel is nearing the end of its work and at my request advised on how the scheme should be wound up. After consulting with the various interested parties, he has recommended that <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-31">31 August</phrase> would be an appropriate date to wind up the scheme. He has also recommended that the panel should continue to advise on an ad hoc basis on any claims received after that date. I am pleased to accept all his recommendations, and I have placed a copy of his report in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/3">Under wartime legislation, the Government confiscated all assets in British territory owned by residents of enemy countries. The enemy countries included Nazi Germany and its allies, as well as countries occupied by them. After the war, the assets of the occupied countries were released from British Government control but the assets of the belligerent countries were distributed to British creditors whose assets had been confiscated by the enemy countries. An exception was made for victims of Nazi persecution, and soon after the war Nazi victims or their heirs could claim the return of their assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/4">In Spring 1997, following public concern that there were still many assets belonging to victims that had not been returned, the British Government published research on the history of the administration of enemy property and placed on the Internet at <a href="http://www.enemyproperty.gov.uk">www.enemyproperty.gov.uk</a> a database of the assets seized from residents of belligerent enemy countries. A major problem was that many of the individual files had been destroyed and it was not obvious which of the assets had been returned. However the Government believed that the injustice had to be addressed and asked Lord Archer of Sandwell in June 1998 to advise on the design of a compensation scheme. The Government subsequently accepted Lord Archer's recommendations and the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced in December 1998 a compensation scheme administered by an independent Enemy Property Compensation Advisory Panel (EPCAP).</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/5">EPCAP launched the Enemy Property Payments Scheme in April 1999 under the chairmanship of Lord Archer of Sandwell, sitting with two teams of assessors expert in finance and ethnic minority issues. They have considered nearly 1,100 applications for compensation and 377 claims have been assessed as qualifying for payment and a total of &pound;16.2 million paid to claimants for assets that were confiscated. Claims have been submitted from all parts of the world and oral hearings were convened for those cases that proved difficult to resolve. A separate adjudicator, Sir Christopher Staughton, was appointed to consider appeals against EPCAP's decisions. He considered 52 appeals, and found in favour of 15.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/6">Some 220,000 assets were confiscated and either sold or returned to the original owners. The only material asset that remains is a gilt bracelet and diamond tie-pin. We know that these belonged to Marck Kellermann, a brush salesman from Bratislava in the former Czechoslovakia. Despite the best efforts of the panel, it remains unclaimed. I am pleased to announce that the Imperial War Museum is in discussions with my officials about the safekeeping of the jewellery until such time as Mr Kellermann's heirs come forward or are found.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/7">I am very grateful to Lord Archer and his team of assessors and to the appeal adjudicator for their work in resolving a long-running difficult issue that has previously been neglected by successive governments.</p>
