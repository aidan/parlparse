	Marriage Law

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-07-08a.39.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="39"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040708/text/40708-48.htm#40708-50_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.39.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-10">10 July 2003</phrase> the Government published the consultation paper, <i>Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change</i>. This set out our proposals to reform civil registration in England and Wales using powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. It remains our intention, as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury announced on <phrase class="date" code="">29 March</phrase> this year, to bring forward two orders under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. One, planned for this Session of Parliament, will amend the current legislation on birth and death registration. The second, on marriage law, has been deferred to enable us to take into account Parliament's wishes on civil partnership legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/2">Preliminary consideration of the responses to <i>Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change</i> suggests that there is an issue regarding the proposals for marriage on which there should be further consultation. The issue concerns the absence of any proposal to change the legal requirement for marriage ceremonies to be either civil or religious. Policy in this area of marriage law is the responsibility of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In the coming months and in consultation with others, we will be working with Treasury Ministers and the General Register Office for England and Wales to determine the scope of any revised proposals.</p>

	Enemy Property Payment Scheme
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-07-08a.44.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="44"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040708/text/40708-48.htm#40708-50_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.44.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/2">The UK Government scheme to pay compensation to victims of Nazi persecution whose property was confiscated during the Second World War under the trading with the enemy legislation will close on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-31">31 August 2004</phrase>. Lord Archer of Sandwell, the chairman of the Enemy Property Claims Assessment Panel, has reported to me that the panel is nearing the end of its work and at my request advised on how the scheme should be wound up. After consulting with the various interested parties, he has recommended that <phrase class="date" code="">31 August</phrase> would be an appropriate date to wind up the scheme. He has also recommended that the panel should continue to advise on an ad hoc basis on any claims received after that date. I am pleased to accept all his recommendations, and I have placed a copy of his report in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/3">Under wartime legislation, the Government confiscated all assets in British territory owned by residents of enemy countries. The enemy countries included Nazi Germany and its allies, as well as countries occupied by them. After the war, the assets of the occupied countries were released from British Government control but the assets of the belligerent countries were distributed to British creditors whose assets had been confiscated by the enemy countries. An exception was made for victims of Nazi persecution, and soon after the war Nazi victims or their heirs could claim the return of their assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/4">In Spring 1997, following public concern that there were still many assets belonging to victims that had not been returned, the British Government published research on the history of the administration of enemy property and placed on the Internet at <a href="http://www.enemyproperty.gov.uk">www.enemyproperty.gov.uk</a> a database of the assets seized from residents of belligerent enemy countries. A major problem was that many of the individual files had been destroyed and it was not obvious which of the assets had been returned. However the Government believed that the injustice had to be addressed and asked Lord Archer of Sandwell in June 1998 to advise on the design of a compensation scheme. The Government subsequently accepted Lord Archer's recommendations and the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced in December 1998 a compensation scheme administered by an independent Enemy Property Compensation Advisory Panel (EPCAP).</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/5">EPCAP launched the Enemy Property Payments Scheme in April 1999 under the chairmanship of Lord Archer of Sandwell, sitting with two teams of assessors expert in finance and ethnic minority issues. They have considered nearly 1,100 applications for compensation and 377 claims have been assessed as qualifying for payment and a total of &pound;16.2 million paid to claimants for assets that were confiscated. Claims have been submitted from all parts of the world and oral hearings were convened for those cases that proved difficult to resolve. A separate adjudicator, Sir Christopher Staughton, was appointed to consider appeals against EPCAP's decisions. He considered 52 appeals, and found in favour of 15.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/6">Some 220,000 assets were confiscated and either sold or returned to the original owners. The only material asset that remains is a gilt bracelet and diamond tie-pin. We know that these belonged to Marck Kellermann, a brush salesman from Bratislava in the former Czechoslovakia. Despite the best efforts of the panel, it remains unclaimed. I am pleased to announce that the Imperial War Museum is in discussions with my officials about the safekeeping of the jewellery until such time as Mr Kellermann's heirs come forward or are found.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/7">I am very grateful to Lord Archer and his team of assessors and to the appeal adjudicator for their work in resolving a long-running difficult issue that has previously been neglected by successive governments.</p>
