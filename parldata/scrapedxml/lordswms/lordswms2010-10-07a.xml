	Correction to Lords Oral Answer
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-10-07a.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100912" speakername="Lord Marland" colon=":" colnum="7"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101007-wms0001.htm#10100713000003">
	<p pid="a.7.1/1">The answer I provided to a supplementary question raised by Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan on the timing of the commercial availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in relation to Lord Hunt of Kings Heath's Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-28">28 July</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-07-28.1292"><I>Official Report</I>, cols. 1292-93</phrase>) was inaccurate in terms of the detail on the CCS demonstration programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/2">The corrected answer is as below.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/3">The first CCS commercial-scale demonstration in the UK is likely to be the CCS demonstration competition, which is the subject of an ongoing procurement exercise. We are currently supporting detailed front-end engineering and design (FEED) work. We expect to make an announcement on the preferred bidder next year and depending on the choice of project could see the first commercial-scale demonstration in the UK by 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/4">On the additional three CCS demonstration projects we plan to launch a call for proposals by the end of this year with operation of all three plants by 2020 at the latest.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/5">The UK's programme of CCS demonstration projects is designed to accelerate the proving of CCS so that the technology can be offered on commercial terms from 2020.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.3/2">At the EU patent ministerial dinner on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-29">29 September</phrase>, the main discussion topic was how to progress the proposed EU patent language translation arrangements. Most member states felt the Commission's three-language regime proposal (English, French and German) was acceptable. The UK supported the proposal and was keen to reach agreement. One or two member states wished to explore other possible options and the presidency undertook to hold follow-up bilateral meetings with member states to help try to reach an agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.3/3">The informal council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September</phrase> comprised industry presentations and ministerial discussions which focused on future EU competitiveness and how the EU should respond to global competition. The sessions included a high-level panel discussion in the morning on the EU's long-term strategy, which BIS Secretary of State Vince Cable (who the presidency had invited to be on the high-level panel) took part in. The panel session discussed the importance of promoting competitiveness and innovation to secure EU economic growth. At the council's afternoon sessions, EU Ministers discussed ways to strengthen the EU internal market. I stressed the UK's EU priorities of deepening the EU single market, promoting trade and maintaining flexible labour markets in order to boost EU competitiveness.</p>
