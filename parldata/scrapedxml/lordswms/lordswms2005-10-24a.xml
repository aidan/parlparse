</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-10-24a.63.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="63"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51024-19.htm#51024-19_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.63.1/1">The British Council, although not a government department, receives a substantial grant-in-aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The council regularly organises or sponsors exhibitions overseas of works of art loaned from national galleries and private collections in the United Kingdom. It provides certain assurances or guarantees in respect of loss or damage while these works are on loan.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/2">In the six months ending on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, the British Council provided such assurances to 15 national lenders and undertakings to 79 private lenders. The value of the contingent liabilities outstanding on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase> in respect of private lenders was &pound;14,758,122 and in respect of national lenders it was &pound;24,676,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" name="Alun Michael">My right honourable friend the Minister for Industry and the Regions (Alun Michael)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Satement.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">21 July</phrase> I laid before Parliament the annual reports and accounts for England's eight regional development agencies (RDAs) outside London for 2004&ndash;05 and the RDAs' reported Tier 3 output results for 2004&ndash;05. Copies were placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/3">It has since been brought to my attention that the output figure for employment opportunities was reported inaccurately by Advantage West Midlands. Amended copies of the output results have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and are also available on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/rda/info">www.dti.gov.uk/rda/info</a>. The correct figure is 11,760, which is above the agency's target of 11,200. The incorrect figure given in July was 15,439.</p>
