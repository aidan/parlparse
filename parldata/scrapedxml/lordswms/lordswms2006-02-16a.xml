<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-02-16a.95.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="95"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60216-23.htm#60216-23_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.95.1/1">Further to the announcement made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase> (col. 166WS), the Government are announcing today that the introduction of a requirement for the pre-movement testing of cattle to help reduce the risk of spreading bovine TB through movements of cattle in England has been put back from <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase> it will be a statutory requirement that cattle aged over 15 months moving out of a 1&ndash;2 yearly tested herd must have tested negative to a TB test within 60 days prior to movement unless the herd or movement is exempt.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/3">The short delay in introducing the measure is a result of concerns raised by the farming industry and veterinary profession and will give the industry more time to prepare for the measure. In addition an independent adviser will be appointed to carry out a rapid survey of veterinary capacity and preparedness to deliver the new requirements for pre-movement testing. The detail of the pre-movement testing policy will not be subject to review.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/2">It has been brought to my attention that the reply I gave the honourable Member for Bury St Edmunds, David Ruffley, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, Commons, col. 248W, did not contain an adequate explanation of shortcomings in the data provided. I apologise for this oversight.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/3">The figures in the last two columns of the table provided are not comparable over the time series given.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/4">Due to an operational decision at the time of transfer, between 1993 and 1995, many existing invalidity benefit cases had their start-dates reset at the time of transfer to the incapacity benefit system, resulting in an underestimate of long-term IB cases prior to May 2000.</p>

	Pensions: Financial Assistance Scheme
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-02-16a.99.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="99"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60216-25.htm#60216-26_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.99.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions Reform (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/2">The general notification period for the financial assistance scheme ends on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase>. The notification period began on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September</phrase> and is the period during which the scheme manager must be supplied with some basic details of potentially eligible pension schemes in order for them to be considered for qualification. The scheme manager may, at his discretion, accept notification of those details for any particular scheme after the <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/3">Although FAS offers help to those pension schemes which began winding up between <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase> where the principal employer became insolvent on or before <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase>, extending the notification period for any particular scheme also extends the period in which an insolvency event can occur. This means it may be possible for some pension schemes which would not otherwise qualify for FAS or for compensation offered under the pension protection fund to become qualifying schemes for FAS. I wish to make it clear that we may be able to extend help to some individual pension scheme members who have lost part or all of their occupational pensions but who may not have appeared eligible for help from either FAS or the PPF.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/4">The Government will set a definitive cut-off date for insolvency events before the end of the calendar year. Until then the scheme manager will consider requests for an extension to the notification period from those pension schemes that undergo a qualifying insolvency event after the <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-13">13 December 2005</phrase> in response to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" name="Kitty Ussher">the honourable Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher)</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>, Commons, col. 1907W, Alun Michael, Minister for Industry and the Regions informed the House that the DTI's Small Business Service (SBS) would shortly be publishing the overall small business research initiative (SBRI) performance figures for 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05. I have today published these figures. A copy has been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">The overall SBRI target is that government departments will procure at least 2.5 per cent of their extramural R&amp;D from small firms. Very good progress is being made. In 2004&ndash;05, of a proposed SBRI baseline of &pound;2,532.9 million, &pound;269.1 million (10.6 per cent) went to small firms in the form of contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">Also on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase>, in reply to a Question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the honourable Member for Burnley (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, col. 1675W)</phrase> as to whether the guidelines issued to all government departments in implementing the mandatory SBRI would be placed in the Library, the Minister for Industry and the Regions said the guidelines were being revised and would be placed in the Library shortly; the updated guidelines have, today, been placed in the Libraries.</p>
