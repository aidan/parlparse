	Armed Forces: Coroners' Inquests
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-02-02a.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="5"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100202-wms0001.htm#10020252000003">
	<p pid="a.5.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/2">My honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces (Bill Rammell) and I wish to make the latest in the series of quarterly statements to the House about the inquests of service personnel and others who have died overseas. We continue to hold in the highest possible regard all of our service personnel who are or have been involved in the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our deepest sympathies lie, of course, with the families of those personnel who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. It is again a cause of particular sadness that since our last Statement a further 28 service personnel have lost their lives in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/3">Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-27">27 October 2009</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2009-10-27.7"><I>Official Report</I>, col. 7WS</phrase>), with information about the conduct of inquests by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This Statement gives the position at <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-25">25 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/4">The tables which accompany this Statement again include information about those cases which involve a Board of Inquiry or a Service Inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/5"><I>Progress with inquests</I></p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/6">At the time of the last Statement, we reported that up to <phrase class="date" code="0260-10-16">16 October 260</phrase> inquests had been held since June 2006: 246 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham between March 2003 and July 2005. Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-16">16 October</phrase>, a further 19 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This makes a total of 279 inquests held since June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/7">Since operations commenced in 2001, there have been a total of 303 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including five service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/8">We remain deeply grateful for the efforts of all of the coroners who are involved in conducting these inquests, and totally committed in our support for the independent coronial system. Our departments continue to work closely together, and with the coroners, to review the way in which the system is working and to look for opportunities, prior to the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, to make improvements for the benefit of the bereaved families.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/9"><I>Open inquests</I></p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/10">Pre-<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> <I>f</I><I>atalities</I></p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/11">There are no outstanding pre-March 31 2007 inquests in the Oxfordshire coroner's district.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/12">Post-<phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> <I>f</I><I>atalities</I></p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/13">Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests does not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon district (since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, fatalities have been repatriated via RAF Lyneham). The coroner transfers inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible. It is helpful that the district continues to benefit from the experience and expertise of David Masters, who retired as coroner on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase> but has been appointed as an assistant deputy coroner by his successor, David Ridley.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/14">There are 113 open inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> (55 involving deaths in the past six months). Of these, Mr Ridley has retained 56 inquests, whilst 53 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next-of-kin, and four inquest transfers are pending. At <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-25">25 January</phrase> two recent fatalities had been repatriated but the inquests were yet to be opened. Two recent fatalities awaited repatriation and inquest opening. Hearing dates have been set in 20 cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/15"><I>Inquests into the deaths of service personnel who returned home injured</I></p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/16">There remain eight inquests to be held of service personnel who returned home injured and subsequently died of their injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/17">We shall continue to keep the House informed about progress with the remaining inquests. I have placed tables in the Library of the House which outline the status of all cases and the date of death in each case. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions and the Ageing Society (Angela Eagle) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/2">I am pleased to announce the publication today of <I>Building a Society for All Ages-consultation response</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/3">In July 2009, we published <I>Building a Society for All Ages</I>, the Government's strategy for addressing the opportunities and challenges of our ageing society. This sets out the changes we all need to make to adapt to the fact that we are all living longer and provides a co-ordinated package of strategic reforms to enable people to prepare for and live well in later life. The strategy was subject to a full formal public consultation, running from July to October 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/4">As part of the consultation process we organised events across the country to hear peoples' views and experiences as well as seeking feedback by online responses and via the post. We received 345 written responses and around 600 people participated in discussion events. Today we are publishing a summary of what we have heard both in written responses to the consultation questions and at consultation events. It also provides an update on how the initiatives set out in the strategy have developed as a result of this feedback.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/5">Key developments are aimed at driving changes in attitudes towards older people and improving service delivery. We have now co-produced <I>A Good Place to Grow Older</I><I>-</I><I>a National Commitment</I> with national bodies which represent a whole range of local service deliverers and key government departments. The commitment sets out a number of specific pledges which its signatories have committed to adopt and translate into action to deliver the strategy at a local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/6">In January we launched the &#163;2.9 million &quot;Get Digital&quot; programme which will soon provide around 7,800 people in sheltered housing with access to computers and the training they need to make the most of the new technology on offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/7">Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

	Vehicles: Speed Limits

	<p pid="a.8.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Paul Clark) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/2">The department has today issued a consultation document on proposals to vary the motorway speed limits for certain classes of commercial vehicles. Under the proposals, the maximum speed limit for HGVs not exceeding 7.5 tonnes would be reduced from 70 mph to 60 mph. The change would also see the maximum speed limit for passenger carrying vehicles adapted to carry more than eight passengers (PCVs) and not exceeding 12 metres in length reduced from 70 mph to 65 mph; and, the limit for longer PCVs increased from 60 mph to 65 mph.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/3">I have placed copies of the document in the House Library.</p>
