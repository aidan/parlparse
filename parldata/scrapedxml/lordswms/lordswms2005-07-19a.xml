	<p pid="a.80.2/1">In my Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-14">14 June 2004</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, cols. <i>WS 22&ndash;23</i>) I undertook to inform the House by way of Written Statement when any further charges are laid against British servicemen arising from incidents in Iraq. The Army Prosecuting Authority has directed that seven individuals should stand trial by court martial for various offences. The offences and the names of those individuals are set out below. Click on the following link to view the <a href="/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/50719ws1.pdf">/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/50719ws1.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2">The allegations against the servicemen relate to incidents in Basra, from 13 to <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-15">15 September 2003</phrase>. It is alleged that seven servicemen committed a number of offences against Iraqi detainees who had been arrested following a planned operation. One of the detainees, Baha Da'oud Salim Musa, was allegedly killed and inhumanely treated by one of these servicemen. The same serviceman is also alleged to have inhumanely treated other detainees and committed acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice. It is further alleged that two other servicemen inhumanely treated the internees, who sustained injuries following repeated assaults. One further serviceman is alleged to have assaulted a detainee. The three remaining servicemen are charged with negligently performing their duties or neglecting to perform a duty, contrary to the Army Act 1955.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/3">The cases against all seven servicemen were reviewed by prosecutors of the independent Army Prosecuting Authority who applied the evidential and public interest criteria set out in the code for crown prosecutors. The Army Prosecuting Authority, following advice from highly experienced counsel, is satisfied that there is a realistic prospect of convicting all defendants and that the prosecutions are in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/4">These offences have been directed to be tried before a court martial rather than the civilian courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/5">The men who have been directed by the Army Prosecuting Authority to stand trial and who have been informed of the charges against them are:</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/6" class="indent">Corporal Donald Payne (34) of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, attached to 1st Battalion The Kings Regiment, based at Catterick, charged with three offences of: (i) manslaughter; (ii) inhuman treatment of persons; and, (iii) perverting the course of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/7" class="indent">Lance Corporal Wayne Ashley Crowcroft (21) of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, currently based in Cyprus, charged with inhuman treatment of persons.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/8" class="indent">Private Darren Trevor Fallon (22) of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, currently based in Cyprus, charged with inhuman treatment of persons.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/9" class="indent">Sergeant Kelvin Lee Stacey (28), of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, currently based in Cyprus charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, alternatively common assault.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/10" class="indent">Warrant Officer Mark Lester Davies (36) of the Intelligence Corps based in Preston, charged with neglecting to perform a duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/11" class="indent">Major Michael Edwin Peebles (34) of the Intelligence Corps, based at Northwood, charged with negligently performing a duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/12" class="indent">Colonel Jorge Emmanuel Mendonca (41) late of Queen's Lancashire Regiment, based at Northwood, charged with negligently performing a duty.</p>
