	Armed Forces: Defence Training Review
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-12-15d.205.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="205"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61215-wms0001.htm#06121567000005">
	<p pid="d.205.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Derek Twigg) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="d.205.1/2">The defence training review (DTR) programme aims to improve, modernise and rationalise the delivery of phase 2 and phase 3 specialist training. A PPP solution is being considered to deliver training on a defence rather than single service basis, and seeks to bring about the necessary modernisation and flexibility required to accommodate the department's changing training requirements. The programme also aims to rationalise the existing training estate and provide investment in key sites to create centres of training excellence.</p>
	<p pid="d.205.1/3">Bidders' proposals were received for package 1 on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-17">17 October 2005</phrase>, and package 2 on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-14">14 November 2005</phrase>, and a period of robust evaluation has concluded, with recommendations now being considered. Ministers have not yet made a decision. This is an extremely complex programme and we are committed to obtaining the best outcome for defence. However, I can confirm that an announcement of preferred bidders will now be delayed to the New Year, although the precise timing of the announcement cannot be given at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="d.206.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="d.206.1/2">I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of the Ministry of Defence's autumn performance report. This shows that defence continues to deliver on its primary objectives in challenging circumstances. In particular, the Armed Forces, supported by their civilian colleagues, continue to succeed on current operations and have made a significant contribution towards the Government's wider conflict prevention goals.</p>
