	Child Trust Fund: Draft Regulations
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-02-03a.21.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100399" speakername="Lord McIntosh of Haringey" colon=":" colnum="21"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040203/text/40203-46.htm#40203-46_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.21.1/1">The Child Trust Funds Bill will ensure that every child, whatever their family background, will have access at the age of 18 when they begin their adult life to a stock of assets which they can invest in their future. The child trust fund will also help children and their parents to understand the benefits of saving and investment and how to engage with financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/2">The Government are today publishing draft child trust fund regulations. These draft regulations will be of particular interest to potential providers of the child trust fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/3">The draft regulations include the requirements for a stakeholder child trust fund account. Every child trust fund provider will make a stakeholder account available as one of the investment options. A stakeholder child trust fund account will have its charges capped at 1.5 per cent per year, and providers will be required to accept all contributions of &pound;10 and above. No charges will apply to transfers between different types of accounts, including from stakeholder to non-stakeholder, and between providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/4">The Government's decision on the charge cap is in the best interests of consumers, as it encourages as wide a selection of providers as possible to offer child trust fund accounts. A large number of providers will encourage competition and ensure the best value for consumers. The Government will continue to monitor that the level of the charge cap best meets the interests of consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/5">The decision was evidence-based and considered the particular characteristics of the child trust fund. The economics of the child trust fund are very different from other financial products, such as the stakeholder pensions. In particular, child trust fund accounts will be smaller in terms of the average size of funds compared to pensions and will have a lower minimum contribution level than other stakeholder products.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/6">The evidence on which the decision for the cap was based included the report commissioned by the Government from Deloitte, which looked at the trade-offs of different charge caps for providers and consumers. Deloitte's report will be published later this year, at the same time as its report on the other products in the stakeholder suite.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/7">The minimum contribution for the stakeholder account has been set to ensure the child trust fund is accessible to all savers, including those who cannot commit to regular contributions. Providers will be free to accept lower contributions if they wish and it is expected that competition among providers could drive down the minimum amounts accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/8">The Government will continue to work with the Financial Services Authority on the development of an appropriate regulatory regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/9">Copies of the draft regulations together with an explanatory commentary are available in the Printed Paper Office and the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.1/3">The printed national report (part 2) contains tables on migration and on travel-to-work and workplace populations as well as new tables on members of the Armed Forces and on same-sex couples.

	Middle East: Israeli Security Fence
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-02-03a.23.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="23"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040203/text/40203-46.htm#40203-46_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.23.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December 2003</phrase> the UN General Assembly in Resolution ES-10/14 requested the International Court of Justice to urgently render an advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory. In response to the request, the International Court of Justice has invited UN member states, Palestine, and certain international organisations to contribute written and/or oral statements to the court if they wish to do so. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> the UK submitted a national written statement to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/2">As we have repeatedly made clear, here and elsewhere, the UK considers the building by Israel of a fence, or wall, in the West Bank to be unlawful. The UK's written statement submitted to the court recalls that we voted in favour of UN General Assembly Resolution ES-10/13, adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-21">21 October 2003</phrase>, which demands that Israel stop and reverse construction of the wall in the occupied Palestinian territory. I regret that Israel has not complied with the General Assembly's demand. We recognise Israel's legitimate security concerns. The latest, horrifying suicide bombing in Jerusalem on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-29">29 January</phrase> only too clearly shows the continuing threat faced by Israel from terrorists. But building the fence on occupied land only complicates efforts to make progress towards a comprehensive peace settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/3">Despite our view on the illegalities of the fence, we argued against this question being referred to the International Court of Justice. This approach is one shared by all members of the European Union including all accession states. This is being communicated by the Irish presidency to the court. The UK has also submitted a detailed written statement to the court arguing that the court ought to exercise its discretion to decline to give an opinion. Our arguments are about the use of the court's advisory jurisdiction. We believe that it is inappropriate to embroil the court in a heavily political bilateral dispute. We also believe the court should not be engaged where the consent of both parties has not been given. An opinion is not necessary to assist the General Assembly in reaching a view on the fence. Nor, in the absence of participation from one side, will the court have all the facts before it.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/4">Submissions to the International Court of Justice are confidential until the court decides to make them public. We expect the court will make the written statements submitted to it public at the start of the oral proceedings, due to begin on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase>. At that stage, we will place a copy in the Library of the House.</p>
