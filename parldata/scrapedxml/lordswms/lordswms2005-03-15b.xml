	National Enforcement Service
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-03-15b.58.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="58"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050315/text/50315-43.htm#50315-43_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.58.1/1">I am pleased to announce today plans for the introduction of a National Enforcement Service to take forward my commitment to ensuring the fullest possible compliance with court orders. For too long enforcement of court orders has been patchy and flawed. We have made real improvements in enforcement. The payment rate of fines now at 80 per cent compared to just over 50 per cent two years ago. But there is more to be done. The time has come for the next stage of reform</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/2">My proposals involve the introduction of a robust national framework to deliver a single consistent enforcement process for the whole of England and Wales, and to deal robustly with offenders who fail to attend court, default on fine payments and breach community penalty orders. The launch of the new unified Her Majesty's Court Service next month will allow us to put in place a cross-criminal justice system enforcement team that is more distinct, professional and better skilled. The specific remit of the National Enforcement Service will be to bear down on the hard core of offenders who consistently attempt to flout their obligations to the courts. This does not mean a new agency or department, but a better, more collaborative approach to tackling enforcement, which builds on the lessons learned from national initiatives including the recent &quot;Operation Payback&quot;. Enforcement staff in the magistrates' courts together with the police, the National Probation Service and other criminal justice agencies will form the core of the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/3">Improving sentence compliance is key to building public confidence in the criminal justice system and the National Enforcement Service will do just that. The National Enforcement Service framework will be tested first across a region from April 2006 with the aim of full national rollout in 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/2">I am announcing today that the key targets that have been set for the chief executive of the Veterans Agency (VA) for the financial year 2005&ndash;06 are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/3">Service</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/4" class="indent">Key target 1: To issue decisions on claims to war pensions in an average of no more than 59 working days. This is an improvement of four working days on the agency's 2004&ndash;05 target; and it represents a cumulative improvement of 41 per cent against the agency's 2000&ndash;01 baseline level of 100 working days.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/5" class="indent">Key target 2: To issue decisions on war widows claims in an average of no more than 23 working days. This is an improvement of two working days on the agency's 2004&ndash;05 target; and it represents a cumulative improvement of 36 per cent against the agency's 2000&ndash;01 baseline level of 36 working days.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/6" class="indent">Key target 3: To achieve an externally-validated war pensions scheme claims accuracy rate of at least 97 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/7" class="indent">Key target 4: To achieve an externally-validated AFCS claims accuracy rate of at least 97 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/8" class="indent">Key target 5: To achieve an externally-validated medical adjudication accuracy rate of at least 97 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/9">Working in Partnership</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/10" class="indent">Key target 6: To work with the Department for Constitutional Affairs Court Service to reduce the average time it takes an appeal to pass through the war pensions appeals process. By <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase> the average time should reduce to no more than 225 working days. This is an improvement of 15 working days on the agency's 2004&ndash;05 target; and it represents a cumulative improvement of 60 per cent against its 2000&ndash;01 baseline level of 565 working days.</p>

	Iran: Body Armour

	<p pid="b.59.3/1">In March 2005, after consultation with the Ministry of Defence and the export control organisations, the DTI, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office donated armoured vests and body armour plates to the Iranian Anti-Narcotics Police (ANP). This gift was to provide an element of protection for the ANP in their work of countering drugs smuggling from Afghanistan. We are satisfied that these goods would be used only for anti-narcotics operations and are therefore prepared to make an exception to the UK national embargo announced in 1993, as amended in 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/2">We are fully committed to implementing the UK embargo on Iran. However, we are, in limited circumstances, prepared to make exceptions where denying an export or a gift would be contrary to the intention of the embargo. As the UK has been active in encouraging and assisting Iran with combating the smuggling of drugs from Afghanistan, I am confident that granting this exception is fully consistent with this responsible approach of supporting the ANP while respecting the aims of the embargo.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/3">A departmental minute announcing the intention to make the gift was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/4">All export licences, F680s and Crown immunity gifts are considered on a case by case basis judged against the consolidated and national arms export licensing criteria.</p>
