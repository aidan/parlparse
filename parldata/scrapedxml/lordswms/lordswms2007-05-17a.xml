	Banks: Unclaimed Assets
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-05-17a.15.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="15"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70517-wms0001.htm#07051781000016">
	<p pid="a.15.1/1">My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/2">The Government are today publishing a consultation document setting out proposals for the distribution of unclaimed assets within the UK. This second unclaimed assets consultation document&mdash;<I>Unclaimed </I><I>A</I><I>ssets </I><I>D</I><I>istribution </I><I>Mechanism: A</I><I></I><I>C</I><I>onsultation</I> &mdash;follows on from the previous document published in March this year<sup>1</sup> and provides further detail on how unclaimed assets will be reinvested in the community, with a focus, in England, on funding for youth services and financial capability and inclusion. The devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will determine their own priorities for distribution which reflect the needs of communities in each country.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/3">The consultation document proposes using the Big Lottery Fund (BIG) as the main UK-wide unclaimed assets distribution body. BIG has a UK-wide distribution infrastructure in place, capacity to handle assets on this scale, extensive experience of delivering community programmes&mdash;with emphasis on young people, and the know-how on distributing funding through a different range of organisations, particularly from the third sector. Using BIG, an existing organisation, to distribute these assets will also help to limit spending on administration costs, meaning that more money reaches the front line.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/4">The Government also want to use a proportion of unclaimed assets to help develop the social investment market and invest in the long-term sustainability of the third sector, and will look at another delivery option to channel funds into this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/5">Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/2">In May 2006, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Patricia Hewitt) announced details of an independent review of palliative care services for children and young people with life-limitingor life-threatening illnesses and their families. This review offers an important opportunity to look at current provision and consider what more can be done to improve the sustainability and accessibility of services in both the statutory and voluntary sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/3">I welcome the thorough review that has been conducted by Professor Sir Alan Craft and Sue Killen and thank them for their efforts. Their report comes at an important point in the evolution of children's services and it is critical that children and their families have confidence in the valuable support that palliative care services currently provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/4">I also recognise and pay tribute to the pioneering work carried out over the years by the voluntary sector and by hugely committed doctors, nurses and other care workers that has got us to this point. Together they have raised the profile of children's palliative care and this has resulted in a model of care which enables the children and families who use those services to live in dignity and comfort.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/5">The independent reviewers have made various recommendations to improve and develop palliative care services and the commissioning and planning systems in which they operate. In the longer term, they recommend that palliative care should become a sub-specialty in its own right and be a properly funded service.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/6">Some of the recommendations are contingent on the Comprehensive Spending Review, the results of which will not be known for some months, while others are for consideration by the voluntary sector, the royal colleges, regulators and other government departments such as the Department for Education and Skills. We are committed to working with these key partners to achieve real and lasting change.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/7">The Government will consider carefully the recommendations and their implications for life-limited children and young people and for the health and social care system across the country. A detailed government response will be formed alongside plans to take forward any recommendations coming outof the HM Treasury/Department for Education and Skills review of disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/8">In the mean time, I am setting up a deliverygroup of key stakeholders to co-ordinate delivery on those recommendations that can be taken forward immediately, including the development of a national strategy for children's palliative care. I very much hope those invited will accept the offer to work with the Government to help achieve the step change weall desire.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.3/9">The report has been placed in the Library and copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office.</p>

This is intended both to ensure that such cases are dealt with expeditiously and to enable the parties to any particular case to know when they can expect to receive a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/3">The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has accordingly today laid before Parliament an Act Paper reporting on all decisions where the inquiry, hearing or site visit ended on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and the decision was made between <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>. Some 199 of the200 decisions (99.5 per cent) made by the Secretary of State during this period on cases other than appeals under tree preservation orders were made within their statutory timetables, as were 694 out of 702 decisions (98.9 per cent) on tree preservation order appeals.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/4">These provisions relate to: decisions on called-in planning applications; planning appeals recovered for the Secretary of State's decision; other cases &quot;linked&quot; to such decisions, including listed building consent, conservation area consent, advertisement consent and enforcement notice appeals; and tree preservation order appeals. They do not apply to cases decided by inspectors or to those decided by the Secretary of State jointly with a Minister of another department.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Alistair Darling) outlined a package of measures on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December 2006</phrase> to put the Post Office network on a stable footing (<I>Official Report</I>, vol. 454, cols. 1026-28).</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/3">In that Statement he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/4">the Government remain committed to allowing people to get their pension or benefit in cash at the post office if they choose to do so, and a range of accounts were already available at the post office that made that possible;the current Post Office card account contract ends in March 2010 and that the Government have decided to continue with a new account after 2010. The new account would be available nationally and customers would be eligible for the account on the same basis as they are now; andthat European Union procurement rules required the Government to tender competitively for this new product.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/5">My department has now started this process by submitting a notice which will appear in the <I>Official Journal of the European Union</I>. I will arrange for a copy of the notice to be placed in the Library. The key elements of the notice are:</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/6">the procurement will cover the provision of end-to-end services (eg, card acquisition and maintenance, and payments of cash) for a simple card-based customer-owned account;the customers should be able to access their cashat an ATM and personal teller outlets (across a counter) located throughout the UK; andthe size of the personal teller network is expected to be in the region of 10,000 outlets.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/7">We will be joined in the procurement exercise by HM Revenue and Customs, the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency and the Northern Ireland Social Security Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/8">Details of the successful bidder(s) will be announced in due course, with our aim being to sign contracts in the first part of 2008.</p>
