	African Development Bank
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-06-02a.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100812" speakername="Lord Tunnicliffe" colon=":" colnum="3"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90602-wms0001.htm#09060260000003">
	<p pid="a.3.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">Today, <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-02">2 June 2009</phrase>, I am publishing the second joint strategic framework for the engagement of the Governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal with the African Development Bank. This framework sets out how the UK and its fellow constituency members will work with the African Development Bank to improve its effectiveness over the next three years to 2011. It replaces joint strategic framework 1 (2006-08).</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3">This joint strategic framework is written at a time of great opportunity but also of great challenge for the African continent. Overall economic performance in most African countries has been good, but progress towards the millennium development goals still needs to accelerate. The global financial crisis has introduced new pressures and uncertainties.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">Slower global economic growth, more difficult credit conditions and changes in the international aid architecture pose additional challenges to which the African Development Bank will need to respond. At the same time, the bank must be better able to deal with the longer-term challenges facing Africa, including climate change, development in fragile states, gender equality, ensuring that private sector growth has positive benefits for the poorest and helping countries in Africa to work and trade together.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/5">In addition to the three-year objectives on bank effectiveness set out in the joint strategic framework, the UK has several specific objectives for the African Development Bank over the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/6"><I>Response to the financial crisis</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/7">The financial crisis is impacting on Africa, with commodity prices down, remittances falling and private investment flows slowing. The bank has a key role to play in Africa's response and to help countries deal with the challenges they are facing. In particular we will work with the bank over the coming year to:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/8">enable it to meet additional demand for lending during the crisis. We expect demands on the bank's finances will increase during the crisis, and we are committed to ensuring the bank has the resources it needs to deliver its mandate for all members; andchange policies that limit the impact of the bank's response, especially removing the cap on the proportion of bank funds that can be used for budget support. <I>Fragile states</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/9">Fragile states experience huge poverty and human development problems. In these countries, the millennium development goals are most off-track with extreme poverty, and child and maternal deaths three to four times more prevalent than in other developing countries. The African Development Bank's &pound;400 million fragile state facility is an important instrument that the bank can use in fragile states. We will work with the bank this year to:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/10">establish effective bank programmes in all countries receiving funding under the fragile states facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/11"><I>Decentralisation</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/12">As the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness said, developing countries must set their own strategies for poverty reduction. To support this, the African Development Bank is decentralising its staff from the headquarters to bank offices around Africa. The bank has made good progress establishing a large number of field offices in recent years, but these offices need to be strengthened with the right expertise and given an appropriate level of delegated authority. This year we will work with the bank to:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/13">complete the decentralisation process in 15 countries, with 15 fully staffed country offices operating effectively with appropriate delegated authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/14"><I>Results</I></p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/15">Effective development organisations need clear objectives and must be able to benchmark and demonstrate progress against achieving them. The African Development Bank now has a single results system for all its operations, but the system is still being bedded in, and in some cases baselines against which progress can be measured still need to be established. We will work with the bank over the coming year to:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/16">establish results frameworks in all bank country strategies; and ensure bank management reports every six months on its performance indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/17">A copy of the joint strategic framework will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/2">The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will meet on 8 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-09">9 June</phrase>. The health and consumer affairs part of the council will be taken on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-09">9 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/3">Items on the main agenda are: patient safety, including prevention and control of healthcare-associated infection; rare diseases; a progress report on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare; and a discussion on the pharmaceutical package, which contains three separate dossiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/4">Ministers will be asked to adopt draft Council recommendations on both patient safety and rare diseases. The patient safety recommendation aims to make patient safety and the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections a priority in member states' public health objectives. The rare diseases recommendation will improve the codification and classification of rare diseases. It will aim to improve the exchange of expertise on rare diseases and, hence, enable more effective treatment of rare diseases in the United Kingdom and other European Union countries. The recommendation also encourages more EU-level research on rare diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/5">There will also be a progress report and discussion on a proposal for a directive of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. The draft directive focuses on codifying ECJ case law on patient mobility and clarifying the rights of patients, together with how member states' health systems can manage patient mobility in a sustainable way.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/6">Also tabled for discussion is the pharmaceuticals package. There are three dossiers under this package:</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/7">a proposal for a directive regarding the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of medicinal products falsified in relation to their identity;a proposal regarding pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use; and a proposal concerning information to the general public on medicinal products for human use.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/8">Both the proposals on patients' rights and the pharmaceutical package are currently being negotiated in Council working groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/9">Over lunch, the presidency will chair an informal ministerial discussion on health security-related matters, including influenza.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/10">Under any other business, there will be information from the presidency on the implementation of the United Nations convention on the rights of people with disability and a progress report on a directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation. There will also be information from the Danish delegation on ingredients in tobacco, and information from the Swedish delegation will provide information on the work programme for their forthcoming presidency.</p>
