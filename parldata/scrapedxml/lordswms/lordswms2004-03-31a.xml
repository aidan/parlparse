	<p pid="a.61.5/1">A team of FCO officials, RAF personnel, British police officers and independent observers visited Guantanamo Bay between 8 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-09">9 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/2">The purpose of the visit was to return five British detainees to the UK, to check on the welfare of the four British detainees who remain there and to explain their position to them. The camp authorities were co-operative and helpful during the visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/3">An FCO official, accompanied by a police officer, informed the five British detainees on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March</phrase> that they would be returned to the UK. Their return took place the following day, <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-09">9 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/4">An FCO official also met the other four British detainees individually. A US official observed the meetings. The FCO official delivered mail for the detainees personally and brought messages back to their families. Detainees are able to send and receive mail through the camp authorities and the ICRC. Delivery remains irregular. We are considering with the US Government ways for them to improve the mail arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/5">The FCO official asked all the British detainees about their health, diet, accommodation, opportunities for exercise and other camp facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/6">The British detainees appeared to be in satisfactory physical health but are increasingly frustrated by their continued detention. Individual welfare issues are being pursued by British officials with the US Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/7">The FCO official informed the four British detainees that, following discussions between the British and US Governments, five other British detainees were to be returned to the UK; and that discussions between the two governments on their own future continued.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/8">The FCO official also informed Mr Abbasi and Mr Begg, both of whom have been designated by the US authorities as eligible for trial by military commission, that if they were to be tried, the British Government have told the US Government that the trial should be fair; and that the two governments continued to explore this and other possible courses of action.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.5/9">The legal proceedings against Mr Abbasi and Mr Begg were suspended in July 2003 pending discussions between the British and US governments. The British Government's position remains that either the British detainees should be tried in accordance with international standards or they should be returned to the UK. The British Government continue to work to resolve their position.</p>

This replaces our previous commitment of two&mdash;one to Standing Force Atlantic and one to the Standing Force Mediterranean. We have also given greater priority to enduring additional commitments in the Arabian Gulf.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.3/3">When, from July 2004 until June 2005, the UK fulfils the role of high readiness force commander (maritime), we will provide a broad range of maritime capability to the NRF. When this duty passes to another nation, the UK will revert to our routine commitment of one DD/FF.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.3/1" class="italic">The following Written Statement corrects the Written Statement made on this subject on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-30">30 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/3">Two new regulatory bodies, which will operate at arm's length from the department, come into being on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase>: the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI) and the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI). A third regulatory body, the Office of the Independent Regulator (OIR), came into being in January this year. The inception of these new bodies will change the department's role in the provision and inspection of healthcare and social services. The effects that this will have on accountability arrangements are set out below.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/4">The role of the OIR is to authorise, monitor and regulate National Health Service foundation trusts (NHSFTs). The independent regulator is directly accountable to Parliament, and the department will not be able to comment on the details of the OIR's day-to-day management. For any questions that might arise in this area, we would provide information on the independent regulator's behalf, but not directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/5">NHSFTs are themselves independent of the department, and are directly accountable to their local populations and to Parliament. Because of this independent status, and NHSFTs' separate and local route of accountability, we will no longer be in a position to comment on, or provide information about, the detail of operational management within such trusts. Any such questions will be referred to the relevant NHSFT chairman.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/6">Notwithstanding these changes, matters of national policy (including the statutory framework for the NHS, and its resources, standards and targets) will of course remain the responsibility of the department. We will therefore continue to respond directly on these issues. We will also continue to respond directly on the services commissioned by the NHS locally, as these remain the responsibility of primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.3/7">As with the OIR, CHAI and CSCI are independent of the department. We will therefore provide information to Members on behalf of these bodies about their activities, but not directly. Two areas of their operations warrant particular notice. The department has traditionally had a much closer involvement in the performance star ratings system. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase>, it will be CHAI's and CSCI's responsibility to devise the form of performance ratings, and their criteria and methodology. The department will approve the criteria devised.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.1/3">This comprehensive plan has been formulated within the context of the agency's ongoing remit to lead the modernisation of the NHS purchasing and supply function. The agency has a strategic role to set out a major development agenda for purchasing and supply in the NHS and working with the commercial directorate has developed a co-ordinated implementation plan for doing so. The business plan sets out clearly how the agency will achieve these aims.</p>
