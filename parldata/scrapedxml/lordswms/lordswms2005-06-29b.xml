	Anti-social Behaviour Orders
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-29b.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="3"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050629/text/50629-16.htm#50629-16_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.3.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety (Hazel Blears) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/2">I am announcing today statistics relating to anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs). An ASBO is a civil order which protects the community from behaviour that has caused or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as the perpetrator.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/3">ASBOs were introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and have been available since April 1999. ASBOs can be issued to anyone aged 10 years or over. They impose restrictions on the behaviour of individuals who have behaved in an anti-social way and protect communities from often longstanding and highly intimidating activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/4">Breach of an ASBO is a criminal offence and can lead to custody. The maximum penalty for breach of an ASBO is five years' imprisonment or a fine of up to &pound;5,000 for an adult offender. The Home Office is notified by all courts of ASBOs issued.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/5">Data on the number of ASBOs issued are updated quarterly. New figures for the period up to December 2004 are now available. These figures show that, for the period between April 1999 and December 2004, the number of ASBOs issued (as reported to the Home Office) was 4,649. The number of ASBOs issued in the quarter October to December 2004 is 17 per cent of the total number of ASBOs issued over all quarters and indicates that ASBO numbers for the latest quarter are double those of the same quarter last year (October to December 2003: 364 ASBOs).</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/6">Of those ASBOs issued, 52 per cent were to adults and 44 per cent to juveniles (4 per cent of ASBOs are age unknown). Fifty-five per cent were orders on application, 45 per cent were orders on conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/7">I intend to make a similar Statement to the House every quarter to provide an update on ASBOs statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/8">I have placed with the House Libraries a briefing note containing information about ASBOs and the ASBOs statistics issued today.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Tony McNulty) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/2">I am pleased to announce the publication of the independent Complaints Audit Committee (CAC) annual report for the year 2004 to 2005. Copies are available in the Library of the House and on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's (IND) website.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/3">This is the CAC's 11th report. Its role is to monitor the effectiveness of IND's procedures for investigating complaints about the conduct and efficiency of staff in IND. Its findings are extremely valuable to the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/4">The annual report highlights a number of areas where IND could improve its customer service, supported by a number of recommendations. IND will use these recommendations to help inform its wider change and reform strategy, one of the key elements being to make IND a more customer focused organisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/2">I have today given consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Scottish and Southern Energy's application to construct and operate flue gas desulphurisation plant at its Fiddler's Ferry coal-fired power station near Warrington. Planning permission has also been given subject to the inclusion of 52 conditions agreed with Warrington Borough Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/3">Coal and other fossil fuels remain vital ingredients in our energy mix, but we need to reduce the impact that burning them has on the environment. Fitting flue gas desulphurisation plant at Fiddler's Ferry is a welcome step forward and will help reduce the damaging effects of acid rain.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.1/2">With my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, I am pleased to inform the House that UK Trade and Investment announced today, at its launch of the UK inward investment 2004&ndash;05 report, that there were 1,066 direct investments in the UK by foreign owned companies between <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. This is an increase of 31 per cent on the year. Among business sectors, the largest number of projects were in IT, followed by software and pharma and biotech. Total jobs figures were up 26 per cent to 75,043 of which 39,592 were new jobs (up 55 per cent on the previous year) and 35,451 safeguarded jobs (up 5 per cent on 2002&ndash;03)</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/3">This performance reflects the confidence companies around the world continue to show in the business climate in the UK. The number of new projects has increased by 49 per cent from 339 in 2003&ndash;04 to 506 in 2004&ndash;05, while mergers/acquisitions and joint ventures were up 41 per cent from 187 in 2003&ndash;04 to 264 in 20004&ndash;05.

	<p pid="b.7.1/4">The competition is fierce, but we will not allow our position as market leader in Europe to make us complacent. UKTI will further strengthen and sharpen its operations in priority markets and the Government will continue to ensure that the UK provides economic growth and stability and an innovative climate to attract investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/5">I am arranging for a copy of the UK inward investment 2004&ndash;05 report to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
