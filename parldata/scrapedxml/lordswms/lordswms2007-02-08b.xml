	Animal Welfare: Seal Hunting

	<p pid="b.43.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs, Mr Ian McCartney, has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/2">The Government are deeply concerned about the reported cruelty during the Canadian seal hunt. They have undertaken a review of policy on this issue and has concluded that the UK should press the European Commission to propose EU-wide measures to ban the import of listed harp and hooded seal products. This would establish a harmonised EU approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/3">It is the Government's view that action taken at EU level would be more effective than national measures alone, avoiding distortions in the operation of the single market and allowing for effective enforcement by customs authorities. The UK is committed to pursuing EU action and ensuring that any resulting EU Commission proposal will be effective. We are writing to Commissioner Dimas requesting urgent action.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/4">Meanwhile, the EU proposal for an EU-wide ban on the domestic cat and dog fur trade is under active discussion within the Council of the European Union and European Parliament and we hope to be able to agree this proposal as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.1/1">My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/2">I represented the UK at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January 2007</phrase>. The German Finance Minister, Peer Steinbrueck, chaired the Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/3"><I>German Presidency Work Programme</I></p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/4">Ministers took note of a presentation by the German presidency on its ECOFIN work programme for the next six months. The presidency noted that Europe continued to face major challenges, for example from globalisation. ECOFIN's work under the German presidency would reflect this, including through further integration of the internal market.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/5">The UK added its support and stressed the importance of promoting an open and flexible single market, as set out in the HMT/DTI paper on single market reform published on the same day. This paper stresses the need for a single market that allows European businesses to compete in global markets, while fostering innovation and market dynamism. A revised strategy should therefore focus on driving up competition, take prioritised action where the potential economic benefits are greatest, based on clear evidence, and use a wider range of policy tools to achieve a well functioning single market. The UK also said that enhancing EU-US economic relations and tackling unfair tax competition had a part to play.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/6"><I>Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact</I></p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/7">Commissioner Almunia outlined the Commission's recommendation to abrogate France's excessive deficit procedure, as the deficit was now sustainably below 3 per cent. Member states welcomed this recommendation and adopted a decision under Article 104(12) of the treaty abrogating Decision 2003/487/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in France.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/8"><I>Convergence Reports by the Commission and the European Central Bank</I></p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/9">Ministers took note of a brief presentation by the Commission and the European Central Bank on the December 2006 convergence report on the member states, excluding Lithuania, Slovenia and Sweden, with a derogation from euro membership. The report concluded that the nine member states assessed did not fulfil all the convergence criteria, however the Commission noted that significant progress was being made on inflation, fiscal stability and exchange rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/10"><I>Current status of Slovenia's adoption of the euro</I></p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/11">The Council was briefed by the Slovenian Finance Minister, Andrej Bajuk, the Commission and the European Central Bank on the introduction of the euro in Slovenia. The Commission applauded Slovenia's handling of the introduction of the euro.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/12"><I>Preparation of the Spring European Council</I></p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/13">Ministers held an orientation debate on matters to feed into the Spring European Council. This included the Commission annual progress report, the proposed update to the Integrated Guidelines with Country Specific Recommendations and the draft ECOFIN key issues paper. Discussion centred on the ECOFIN priorities for the key issues paper, ahead of its formal adoption at the February ECOFIN.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/14">The UK stressed the importance of opening up product and capital markets, especially financial services, utilities and energy, and in reducing regulation in line with the HMT/DTI paper on single market reform mentioned earlier. The UK also added that, in the field of tax, tackling unfair tax competition was important in improving economic performance. The German presidency agreed to reflect on the discussion and will subsequently return to this topic at the February ECOFIN.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/15"><I>Better regulation</I></p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/16">The Commission presented a communication and an action plan on efforts to reduce administrative burdens on businesses, which includes setting a target for reducing administrative burdens in the EU. The UK expressed the view that this was a key issue for the EU economic framework. Conclusions are expected to be adopted at the next ECOFIN meeting and will contribute to the spring European Council.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs, Bridget Prentice, has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/2">Today, I am pleased to announce to the House the publication of my department's response to the consultations on the co-ordinated online record of electors. CORE will provide a national source of locally collected and maintained electoral registration data.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/3">CORE will, in addition to reducing the administrative burden on users, assist political parties and the Electoral Commission to meet their obligations under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to ensure that donations to parties are from registered electors. It will also provide an important first step to systematically detecting any potential instances of absent voter fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/4">The Electoral Administration Act 2006 makes provision for the establishment of one or more co-ordinated online record of electors (CORE) schemes. The scheme will shortly be established by a secondary legislation order, a draft of which would first need to be actively approved by both Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/5">The paper sets a clear vision for the operation of the CORE scheme and also highlights the importance of improving the quality of elector information held on local registers to ensure that it is complete and correct.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/6">Copies of the consultation response document are available in the Libraries of both Houses and will also be made available on the website of the Department for Constitutional Affairs.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Science and Innovation (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/2">The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has granted consents under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 for the construction and operation of the gas generating station and wind farm that comprise the Ormonde project.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/3">The consents are being granted to Eclipse Energy Company Limited (EECL) and Ormonde Energy Limited (a majority-owned subsidiary of EECL). This innovative hybrid project will be sited around 10 kilometres from Walney Island and has the potential to generate a total of up to 200MW of electricity, with around half coming from the wind farm.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/4">The decision to grant the consents was taken after a thorough consideration of the possible impacts of the project on a range of environmental and other issues and interests and of the advice received from a range of stakeholders, including statutory consultees on navigation and nature conservation issues. The Secretary of State concluded that the impacts envisaged by those making representations will either be of low significance or can be mitigated or avoided by the use of suitable conditions in the Electricity Act consents or in the licence for the project that is to be issued by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/5">The Secretary of State will, in due course, announce the outcome of an application for the grant of approval for the proposed Ormonde gas field development under the separate Petroleum Act 1998 regime, relating to the extraction of gas from the sea bed. Today's announcement does not prejudge the outcome of that application.</p>

	<p pid="b.48.1/1">My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/2">The fire and rescue service has been undergoing a significant change programme over the past few years so that it is better equipped to meet the challenges of today's world. The way in which the Government engage with the service has also been subject to review. As a consequence, the role and function of Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate has changed, and it no longer undertakes its original core role of inspecting all fire and rescue services in England. We have, therefore, decided that it is no longer appropriate to retain the inspectorate in its current form and that a new professional advisory unit would be better placed to provide independent support to Ministers and officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/3">The unit, which for normal day-to-day working purposes will be called the chief fire and rescue adviser's unit, will be headed by a chief fire and rescue adviser. The primary responsibility for the unit will be to provide Ministers and officials with direct access to a source of authoritative independent professional advice on matters of structure, organisation, performance and future development of fire and rescue business. The unit will also have a number of other duties, including advising Ministers, senior officials, COBR and other government departments during a major emergency and providing professional advice on fire and rescue service matters to local authorities, professional bodies and other interested organisations on FRS matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/4">We will be advertising for the position of chief fire and rescue adviser commencing on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-11">Sunday 11 February 2007</phrase> and expect the new unit to be formally established by summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/5">The chief fire and rescue adviser will be a high profile position. We will be seeking to attract a candidate with proven experience and well developed skills who can demonstrate a strong record of performance across a broad range of criteria, given the key role that the chief fire and rescue adviser will be expected to play.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/6">Sir Graham Meldrum, HM Chief Inspector of Fire Services, retired on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January 2007</phrase> after many years of distinguished service as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Fire Services. We have established, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase>, a transition team within the fire and resilience directorate, with a clear brief to manage the interim period and prepare for the formation of the new advisory unit.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-12">Monday 12 February 2007</phrase>, Land Registry will launch a formal consultation exercise to seek views on the first part of the proposed secondary legislation required to enable professional conveyancers and others to have access to the electronic conveyancing network, which Land Registry will establish. Under the Land Registration Act 2002, a person must enter into a network access agreement with the Chief Land Registrar (who is the head of Land Registry) before he or she can carry out conveyancing transactions electronically. The consultation document includes draft network access rules dealing with the types of agreement there will be, the criteria a person must meet before he or she can obtain an agreement, those terms that must be included in an agreement, and the grounds, and procedure, for termination of an agreement by the registrar. The consultation document also includes a draft order, which it is proposed should be made under the Electronic Communications Act 2000, to provide for electronic contracts for registered land. The consultation document will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	Royal Mail: Financing Framework

	<p pid="b.50.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.3/2">The Government and Royal Mail have agreed to the financing framework following my Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-18">18 May</phrase> last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.3/3">The financing framework will provide Royal Mail with the ability to manage its pension deficit and invest in modernisation to improve its performance and efficiency. In addition to the loan facilities of &pound;900 million and the transfer of &pound;850 million of reserves into an escrow account to support the pension fund announced last year, we have also agreed to make an additional shareholder loan of &pound;300 million available to the business to provide the company with adequate financial headroom. As with the proposed framework already announced, all financing for the Royal Mail will be on commercial terms. We plan to agree the final legal documentation and have these measures in place by <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-25">25 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.3/4">We have also agreed with Royal Mail management a reward scheme that allows the employees to share in the value they help to create in the business as it improves its performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.3/5">Under this reward scheme the Government have agreed to the company providing employees with &quot;partnership units&quot; of a notional value equivalent to a 20 per cent economic interest in the projected equity value of the group in the ordinary course of business and based on the management's plan. This will allow employees to share fully in the value they help to create. In addition, we have agreed to the replacement of the current and highly effective &quot;Share in Success&quot; programme with a new scheme. To provide adequate certainty for the public finances, while properly rewarding the efforts of Royal Mail employees, the partnership unit scheme will run for the duration of the Royal Mail Letters' transformation plan, up until March 2012. Employees can receive a maximum of &pound;5,300 over the period.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.3/6">The scheme aligns employee, management and shareholder interests in making all parties committed to the successful performance of the business&mdash;this is the right approach in a fully competitive market.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.3/7">We fully support the business in delivering the programme of reform that it needs to undertake. We recognise that there are a number of difficult changes that need to be made to the way the company operates, including limiting the pension liability going forward, and fully support the business in making them. It is for the management and staff to make the changes necessary to give the company a sound platform on which to build for long-term success in a competitive market.</p>

	Transport Innovation Fund

	<p pid="b.51.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Mr Douglas Alexanderhas made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/2">Further to the Written Statement by the then Secretary of State, the right honourable Alistair Darling MP, on 26<sup></sup>January 2006 (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/.66"><I>Official Report, </I>Commons; cols. 66-67WS</phrase>), I am today publishing further guidance for local authorities interested in developing business cases for funding from the transport innovation fund (TIF) for local schemes to tackle congestion. Local authorities have asked for support in developing their proposals to enable them to come forward with business cases in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/3">The department has supported those authorities that want to bring forward innovative schemes to address specific local congestion problems. On 6<sup></sup>November we awarded a further &pound;7.5 million of pump-priming funds to support the development of local TIF packages that combine demand management, including road pricing, with better public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/4">Up to &pound;200 million per year from TIF will be made available for such packages. However, although we would not expect to fund any individual package that was larger than the total amount, more may be made available if a sufficient number of high quality and higher value schemes emerge.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/5">We will be particularly looking to fund schemes that can pilot approaches to road pricing elsewhere as well as provide benefits locally. We would hope to see small schemes that could be up and running by 2010-11 and larger local schemes within two years of that. As the forthcoming draft Road Transport Bill will specify, any subsequent proposals on a national road pricing scheme will require new primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/6">We are today sharing the product of the substantial analytical work on local scheme design and appraisal undertaken by the department over the past year. It will help local authorities to develop well designed schemes which are, where appropriate, consistent with each other and any future local or national schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/7">This funding policy is without prejudice to any other decisions that may be required in relation to the schemes that underlie TIF proposals, which will be separately considered at the appropriate time.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/8">Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
