	Sudan: Darfur
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-05-05a.53.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040505/text/40505-11.htm#40505-11_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.53.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Hilary Benn) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2">The Government are gravely concerned about the situation in Darfur, western Sudan. The UN estimates that the fighting has led to the internal displacement of over 750,000 people, with about 130,000 refugees sheltering in Chad. The civilian population is in a precarious state. Humanitarian requirements for food, water and shelter are enormous, but access remains limited. Civilian protection is a major concern with reports of systematic attacks on civilians, including killings, rape, pillage and destruction of livelihoods. The approaching rainy season, due to start in mid-May, will add to the problems, increasing the risk of epidemics and hindering the movement of relief supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">The humanitarian ceasefire agreement, signed on <phrase class="date" code="">8 April</phrase>, is a welcome step forward in resolving the crisis in Darfur. The parties must now live up to those commitments and allow international monitoring with full access to the areas and people affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/4">James Morris, head of the World Food Programme, has just returned from a mission to Sudan. I met him on <phrase class="date" code="">4 May</phrase> and discussed the grave humanitarian situation and the need for the international community to do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/5">I have therefore today agreed an additional &pound;10 million from our contingency reserve for the continuing and severe humanitarian needs in Darfur. This will bring total UK commitments for Darfur to &pound;19.5 million. The UK is the second biggest donor to the Darfur crisis, after the US. Additional information on the UK response to date is set out below.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/6">October to December 2003</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/7">Early assistance for organisations with some access (albeit very limited and variable) to Darfur:</p>

	<p pid="a.53.1/13">Total financial assistance October to December 2003: &pound;4.5 million</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/14">Continuing pressure on the Sudanese Government to allow humanitarian agencies unimpeded access to affected populations and security to operate, and to stop the fighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/15">January to March 2004</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/16">Following partial opening up of Darfur for humanitarian agencies, support to meet basic needs of affected population:</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/17" class="indent">UN Children's Fund &pound;1 million</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/18" class="indent">M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (for south Darfur) &pound;1.15 million</p>

	<p pid="a.53.1/20" class="indent">Action Contre la Faim (for north Darfur) &pound;0.25 million</p>

	<p pid="a.53.1/24">Total financial assistance October 2003 to March 2004: &pound;9.5 million</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/25">Support to UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs to improve its co-ordination and assessment capacity in response to the crisis:</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/26" class="indent">Senior humanitarian adviser based in Khartoum for three months (extended to six months)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-05-05a.54.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="54"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040505/text/40505-11.htm#40505-11_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.54.1/1">My Statements of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-05">5 February</phrase> gave details of a review process established following the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of Angela Cannings. I wish to inform the House of progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/2">The review process is now well advanced. A thorough search to identify all potentially relevant cases has been undertaken, and the process has been extended to include cases involving carers. These measures have resulted in an increase in the total number of cases subject to review from 258 to 298.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/3">To ensure thorough and independent scrutiny of all cases, a three-stage review process has been established. Every case file is subject to a preliminary review by a Crown Prosecution Service area to ascertain its key characteristics. Cases are then passed to a central review team comprising prosecutors who are highly experienced in complex criminal casework. A smaller number of cases are then referred to an interdepartmental group, for a final decision on whether the legal representatives of the convicted persons should be notified that there may be features in a case that warrant further consideration by the Court of Appeal or the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The interdepartmental group works under my direction, and includes representatives from the police, Crown Prosecution Service and Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/4">Reviews have been completed in 97 cases. In 38 of these the person convicted is still serving a custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/5">A significant further number of cases are at an advanced stage of review.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/6">Letters have been sent to the legal representatives of five convicted persons, notifying them that it may be appropriate for the safety of their clients' convictions to be considered further by the Court of Appeal or, if appropriate, the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Two of those convicted are sentenced to life imprisonment and remain in custody. Two have already unsuccessfully sought to appeal their convictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/7">I have made the Court of Appeal aware of the action I am taking and have liaised closely with the chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission to ensure that any cases referred to these bodies will be treated expeditiously. My office stands ready to refer appropriate case files to the CCRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/8">The fact that a case has been referred to legal representatives of the convicted person does not amount to a positive determination that their conviction is unsafe. Should any appeals result from this review, it will be for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide independently whether to contest the appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/9">Sixteen live cases were identified by the CPS as potentially affected by the Cannings judgment. Fifteen have been reviewed. Two cases have been discontinued: a Hampshire case discontinued before trial and a Coventry case discontinued before retrial.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/10">It would not be appropriate to place in the public domain the names of defendants or convicted persons in these cases. This will be a decision for them, following advice from their legal representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/11">CPS areas, the central review team and the interdepartmental group continue to accord this work the highest priority. I am determined that the review should be completed as soon as possible, to bring to an end this period of uncertainty for all those involved. I shall keep the House informed of further progress.</p>

	Department of Trade and Industry: Operating and Financial Review
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-05-05a.59.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040505/text/40505-12.htm#40505-13_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.59.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has made the following Ministerial Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">I am launching today a consultation on draft regulations for a statutory operating and financial review (OFR), following a recommendation of the Company Law Review and proposals set out in the Government's <i>Modernising Company Law </i>White Paper of July 2002. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House and the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3">The OFR regulations will require quoted companies to provide a narrative report setting out the company's business objectives, its strategy for achieving them and the risks and uncertainties that might affect their achievement. It will require companies to report on other matters where these are necessary for an understanding of the business. These matters include employees, the environment and social and community issues. It is proposed that where directors believe that they have nothing to report on those matters, they will have to state that fact. The OFR will represent a move from reporting on past performance to an assessment of the future prospects of the company in both the short and the long term. It will enable shareholders to judge whether the directors' view of the business meets their own long-term investment needs and their own expectations of the way good companies should perform&mdash;companies that understand the importance of human capital, open dealings with customers and suppliers, and their impact on the environment and on the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/4">The OFR will apply to all quoted companies. These are companies registered in Great Britain that are either listed in the Uk or in any other EEA state or whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. The regulations also implement related changes to the directors' report of other companies required by the Accounts Modernisation Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/5">A number of quoted companies already prepare OFRs or adopt the broad approach set out in a guidance statement originally introduced by the Accounting Standards Board in 1993 and revised in 2003. The directors of those companies recognise that such reporting can contribute to the profile of the company and offer the market confidence about its management and prospects. The OFR regulations will provide directors with the opportunity to provide key information to shareholders within a statutory regime which will give reassurance on the quality of the information provided. It will enable the best companies to maintain and promote their high standards while allowing other companies to raise their standards. It will contribute to market stability, shareholder engagement, investment, company performance and corporate social responsibility. It will facilitate informed dialogue between directors and shareholders, encouraging responsible institutional investors to adopt an understanding of the particular businesses their investments rely upon.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/6">The Accounting Standards Board will be preparing a new reporting standard for the OFR. In addition, alongside the consultation, a working group chaired by Rosemary Radcliffe and representing a range of business, investor and wider interests, is publishing practical guidance for directors on the preparation of the OFR. I am extremely grateful to the working group for the hard work it has undertaken on this essential element of the OFR.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/7">The consultation period will end on <phrase class="date" code="">6 August</phrase>. After taking into account responses to the consultation, I intend to lay the regulations before the end of the year, so that they can apply to accounting periods beginning on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>. I hope that all those interested in this issue will respond to our consultation and help us to ensure that the OFR is an effective tool.</p>

	Energy Companies: Special Shares
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-05-05a.63.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="63"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040505/text/40505-12.htm#40505-13_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.63.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has made the following Ministerial Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/2">I wish to inform the House about the Government's decision on the future of special shares held in the British Energy Group, Nuclear Generation Decommissioning Fund Ltd, National Grid Transco plc, Viridian, Phoenix Natural Gas, Scottish Power, and Scottish and Southern Energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/3">The Secretary of State for Scotland and I jointly hold a special share in British Energy plc. I hold a special share in British Energy's English operating subsidiary, British Energy Generation Limited, and the Secretary of State for Scotland holds a special share in the Scottish operating subsidiary, British Energy Generation (UK) Limited. I also hold a special share in the Nuclear Generation Decommissioning Fund Ltd (NGDF) which would be subsumed into the new Nuclear Liabilities Fund (NLF) being created as part of the proposed restructuring of British Energy. In addition, I also hold a special share in National Grid Transco plc. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland holds special shares in Viridian, and Phoenix Natural Gas. The Secretary of State for Scotland holds special shares in Scottish Power, and Scottish and Southern Energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/4">Special shares in these companies require the consent of the relevant Minister for certain significant decisions affecting shareholdings, the structure of the company or disposal of certain assets. In particular government consent is required for any move which would allow a single person to own more than 15 per cent in any of the companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/5">We have been considering carefully the future of these shares which date back to the original privatisation of the companies in the light of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgments on special shares (including BAA) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-13">13 May 2003</phrase>, and, in the case of British Energy, the proposed restructuring of the company. The Government have concluded that the current legal and regulatory framework now provides adequate protection of the public policy objectives, which the special shares were initially set up to cover. We will only maintain those which can be justified and are necessary in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/6">Taking account of the ECJ judgments, the Government have decided to redeem the special shares held in National Grid Transco plc, Viridian, Phoenix Natural Gas, Scottish Power, and Scottish and Southern Energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/7">The Government have decided, however, that it would be justifiable to retain two key provisions of the British Energy special share: first, the provision to require anyone having purchased more than 15 per cent of the issued shares of British Energy to obtain the Government's consent; secondly, the provision requiring the consent of the appropriate Secretary of State for any disposal of a nuclear station by British Energy. It is proposed that both of these provisions will be amended to provide that government consent may be refused only on national security grounds. The nuclear security regime operated by the department's Office for Civil Nuclear Security is robust and comprehensive, and is designed to prevent unauthorised access to nuclear stations or nuclear material falling into inappropriate hands. But in the context of nuclear energy we believe it is justified and proportionate to the risks involved to retain these two particular special share provisions in the companies of the British Energy Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/8">Other provisions of the special shares in the British Energy Group would be given up on the same basis as for the conventional electricity companies. In light of the ECJ judgment it would not be justified to retain general powers over the commercial operations of the company. These rights have not protected, and will not protect, the Government's economic interest in British Energy. This interest arises from the Government's ultimate responsibility to ensure safe management and funding of BE's nuclear liabilities, which would always fall to government in the last resort given their duty to safeguard nuclear safety, security and environmental protection. For the future, it is the contractual arrangements we are putting in place as part of the restructuring that would compel British Energy to contribute to its liabilities and help to minimise demands on the taxpayer, and enable us to monitor the performance of the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/9">The special share in the NGDF will be retained and carried forward into the NLF if British Energy's restructuring is successful. The special share contributes to the protection of government's significant interest in ensuring that the NGDF/NLF company achieves its purpose of receiving, investing and ultimately paying out moneys for the decommissioning of British Energy's nuclear power stations.</p>
