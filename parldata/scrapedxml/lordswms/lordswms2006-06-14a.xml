	<p pid="a.13.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">It was announced by the Secretary of State to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, House of Commons, col. 1795) that it was the Government's intention to restructure the British Army to meet the evolving needs of modern operations. It was confirmed that 22 Signal Regiment was to be formed under Future Army Structures in 2007&ndash;08. The regiment will consist of a new regimental headquarters and three squadrons, involving the transfer and resubordination of 248 Squadron from Colerne and 222 Squadron from Bulford, and the creation of the new 217 Squadron formed largely from personnel of 219 Squadron in York.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3">After detailed examination, I am now pleased to confirm that it has been decided (subject to further detailed work and trade union consultation) that it is our intention to form up the unit at the former RAF site at Stafford. This will enhance the Armed Forces presence currently provided by the Tactical Supply Wing of the Joint Helicopter Command. It is our aim to have 22 Signal Regiment fully formed, with all sub-units, personnel and equipment, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">The proposal will see approximately 570 additional military personnel based at the site, who will be accommodated in the Stafford area. It is also anticipated that approximately 200 families are likely to move to the area, and there will be a requirement for a small number of administrative posts to support the regiment. Taking account of other movements, there will be net decreases of approximately 120 uniformed personnel at Colerne, 130 at Bulford and 40 at York. There are no concomitant reductions in civilian staff anticipated at these three locations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-14a.19.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="19"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60614-49.htm#60614-49_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.19.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Gerry Sutcliffe) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/2">I am pleased to announce today that the Government have issued two publications. One is a consultation document on guidance for conducting domestic homicide reviews across England and Wales, under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 and the second is our annual domestic violence progress report. Copies of both publications have been placed in the Library and are also available from the crime reduction website at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/dv01.htm">www.crimereduction.gov.uk/dv01.htm</a>. These publications are the latest phase in a long line of work aimed at tackling domestic violence, a crime that ruins families and devastates lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/3">Section 9 of the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004, establishes a statutory basis for conducting domestic homicide reviews. The Act imposes a duty on named agencies to have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State as to establishing or conducting such reviews. The named agencies are: chief police officers; local probation boards; local authorities; strategic health authorities; primary care trusts; local health boards; and NHS trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/4">Under the Act, a domestic homicide review is defined as a review of the circumstances in which the death of a person aged 16 or over has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, abuse or neglect by:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/5" class="indent">(a) a person to whom he was related or with whom he was or had been in an intimate personal relationship, or</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/6" class="indent">(b) a member of the same household as himself,</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/7">held with a view to identifying the lessons to be learnt from the death. In practice this will include:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/8" class="indent">identifying the lessons to be learnt from the death, in particular about how local professionals and agencies work together to safeguard victims;</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/9" class="indent">identifying how those lessons will be acted upon and what is expected to change as a result; and</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/10" class="indent">improving inter-agency working and improving protection for domestic violence victims to help prevent future deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/11">Domestic homicide reviews are designed to complement the existing serious case reviews (SCRs) that take place when a child dies or is seriously injured and abuse or neglect is known or suspected to have played a part in the death or serious injury.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/12">The Government want to ensure that the reviews do not simply become a bureaucratic exercise. We will want to ensure that local agencies learn the lessons and implement any recommendations made by the reviews, and that findings with national relevance are shared and acted upon.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/13">The consultation period will end on <phrase class="date" code="">13 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/14">The Domestic Violence Progress Report provides an update on the comprehensive framework set out in last year's national delivery plan for domestic violence and the Government's achievements on this. All the achievements outlined in the delivery plan have only been possible because of the close partnership working across government and with the support and help of the public, private and non-government sectors. Future developments are predicated upon partnership making. It also looks forward to activities planned in 2006&ndash;07 and gives direction to local partnerships, agencies and communities on how to protect adult and child victims of domestic violence and bring perpetrators to justice.</p>
