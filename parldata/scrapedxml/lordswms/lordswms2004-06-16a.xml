	Armed Forces Pension Scheme
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-06-16a.29.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="29"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040616/text/40616-36.htm#40616-36_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.29.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">I announced on <phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, vol 413, cols. 39&ndash;40WS) that the Ministry of Defence would not seek leave to appeal to the House of Lords the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of <i>Mrs Hulme and the Pensions Ombudsman </i>v <i>the MoD</i>. I also announced that, as appropriate, the department would review previous decisions on entitlement to pensions where death in service or injury that resulted in invaliding was due to service and where Armed Forces Pension Scheme administrators have previously not accepted War Pension Scheme decisions on attributability; that awards would be backdated; and that the department would consider compensation to reflect the effect of inflation on the value of pensions over the period of non-payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/3">I can now advise the House that those pensioners, widows, widowers or their estates who will receive backdated pension benefits as a result of this judgment will also receive interest on those payments. Where the error occurred within the last six years, the interest will be based on the scheme's usual formula of simple interest. Where the error occurred beyond six years, interest will be based on a formula using the rate of RPI plus 2 per cent compounded. This is consistent with the formula used in compensating those who were affected by the Armed Forces Pension Scheme tax and related pension errors, which I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-15">15 December 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/4">Work has begun on identifying the cases involved and we hope that back payments and interest will be paid within one year to those who were affected.</p>

	Met Office: Key Performance Targets 2004&ndash;05
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-06-16a.30.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="30"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040616/text/40616-37.htm#40616-37_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.30.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/2">The chief executive of the Met Office is responsible for providing meteorological and related environmental services, including climate change prediction, to a wide range of customers, including the Armed Forces, government departments and local authorities, civil aviation, shipping, emergency services, media, commerce, industry and the general public. The Met Office also undertakes research related to meteorology and climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/3">Over the past 12 months the Met Office completed the challenging relocation of its headquarters and operations centre from Bracknell to Exeter. It was one of the biggest moves of IT capability undertaken in Europe, with no interruption in output or customer service. Some 1,000 staff transferred to Exeter in a project that was completed on time, to budget and against quality standards set. The move to new premises supports new ways of working and an advanced technology and IT infrastructure, which will result in increased resilience and data reliability for the Met Office's customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/4">To reflect the established strategy of investment and growth, the Met Office has adopted a new target relating to growth. A new target has also been included to ensure that the Met Office is prepared for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/5">Previously the Met Office has had a target set against commercial contribution. This has become less relevant given that there is no longer a clear distinction between commercial work and public sector work. This target has therefore been discontinued.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/6">Key Target 1: To achieve an increase in value for the numerical weather prediction index (measuring forecasting skill) of at least 1.4 by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, from the level achieved at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/7">Key target 2: To deliver an operating profit before strategic investments of at least &pound;15.5 million in the financial year 2004&ndash;05, while making strategic investments of between &pound;5.8 million and &pound;6.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/8">Key target 3: To achieve a return on capital employed of at least 3.5 per cent in the financial year 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/9">Key target 4: To achieve direct services growth in both government and non-government revenue of at least 4.1 per cent in the financial year 2004&ndash;05 from the 2003&ndash;04 baseline, while maintaining direct services operating profit.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/10">Key target 5: To have in place, by <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>, basic procedures to answer requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and to review by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> the initial operation of the procedures to ensure that they are fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/11">Key target 6: To develop, by March 2005, an efficiency measure which demonstrates the continuous improvement in value for money of the National Met Service (including the Public Met Service and relevant parts of the National Met Programme).</p>
