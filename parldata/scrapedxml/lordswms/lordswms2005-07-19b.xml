	<p pid="b.71.1/1">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on 18&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">19 July</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw) and the Minister for Europe (Douglas Alexander) will represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/2">The Foreign Secretary will make a short intervention at the start of the GAERC on the London bombings.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/3">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/4">Presidency Work Programme</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/5" class="indent">The Foreign Secretary will give a brief presentation on the GAERC work programme over the next six months. This is an information point only. His presentation will include a brief comment on presidency plans for the future financing negotiation and the future of Europe dossiers. Other key dossiers are: Africa/development, enlargement, UN summit, WTO ministerial and various EU summits (with India, China, Russia, Ukraine and Canada).</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/6">Enlargement</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/7" class="indent">The Foreign Secretary will debrief partners on the most recent meeting of the Croatia Task Force where there was further consideration of Croatian co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. There was no change in the assessment. The Foreign Secretary will confirm our intention to return to this dossier in September. Commissioner Rehn will present the Commission's draft negotiating mandate for Turkey to the Council. We do not expect a substantive discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/8">UN Millennium Review Summit</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/9" class="indent">Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will present the Commission's communication on UN reform to the Council. Conclusions reiterating the EU's strong support for a successful UN millennium review summit outcome are expected to be agreed. These will cover the full range of EU priorities at the UN on development, security and human rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/10">Syria/Lebanon</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/11" class="indent">Syria will be discussed over lunch and will include a briefing from Terje Roed-Larsen, the UN Secretary-General's special envoy on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1559. As president we will underline the importance of the full implementation of UNSCR 1559 and 1595; support the new Lebanese Government; and call on Syria to contribute to regional stability in Lebanon, Iraq and on the Middle East peace process (MEPP).</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/12">Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/13" class="indent">High Representative Solana will debrief the Council on his recent (10&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">14 July</phrase>) visit to the region. We then expect discussion to focus on disengagement (due to begin on <phrase class="date" code="">17 August</phrase>). As president, our priorities remain to work to ensure that disengagement proceeds as smoothly as possible and that Gaza should be left economically viable. In this context, we will call for continued EU support to the work of Jim Wolfensohn, Quartet Special Envoy on Disengagement. As president, we will also highlight the importance of increased co-ordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on disengagement and continue to urge both sides to continue to implement their road map and Sharm el-Sheikh commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/14">Iran</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/15" class="indent">The Council will hold a brief discussion on the results of the presidential election, EU/Iran relations and the E3 process. As president, we will call for a continuation of the existing foreign policy towards Iran and continuation of E3 dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/16">Zimbabwe</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/17" class="indent">The Council will discuss the crackdown by the authorities in Zimbabwe, which has destroyed housing and targeted informal traders. As president, we will be aiming for the agreement of Council conclusions, which make clear the EU's condemnation of these events and include consensus on the need to maintain EU pressure.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/18">Preparation of the EU-China Summit</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/19" class="indent">The EU-China summit will take place in Beijing on <phrase class="date" code="">5 September</phrase>. The GAERC will discuss preparations for the summit. As president, we will update partners on the progress of negotiations with the Chinese. The GAERC will provide an opportunity for partners to feed in their thoughts and to discuss the EU-China joint statement which will record the summit conclusions and set out aspirations for deepening the EU's relationship with China.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/20">Uzbekistan</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/21" class="indent">There will be a brief discussion and the Council is expected to reiterate its concern over the situation in Uzbekistan and to condemn the Uzbek authorities' refusal to allow an independent international inquiry into the recent events in Andizhan. At the <phrase class="date" code="">13 June</phrase> GAERC the Uzbek authorities were given until the end of June to allow for an international inquiry. With this deadline now passed, the EU will be considering a range of restrictive measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/22">World Trade Organisation (WTO)</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/23" class="indent">There will be a brief discussion by the Council. Peter Mandelson will report back to Foreign Ministers on the mini-ministerial in Dalian (12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">13 July</phrase>) and will give an assessment of how preparations are going in the run up to the end-July WTO general council in Geneva. The main trade discussion will however take place during the informal trade Ministers' dinner on <phrase class="date" code="">18 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/24">AOB&mdash;Estonia-Russia Border Treaty</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/25" class="indent">The Estonians have asked for the Estonia-Russia border treaty to be placed on the agenda. They will outline to partners why the ratification of this treaty has stalled and how they hope to take matters forward with the Russian Federation. We do not envision any substantial discussion.</p>

	Family Proceedings Cases

	<p pid="b.73.1/1">With the agreement of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, I am pleased to inform the House that I have today placed in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of the response to the public consultation on disclosure of information in family proceedings cases involving children. Statutory instruments have also been laid today specifying the circumstances in which information can be disclosed from family proceeding cases involving children.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/2">Members will recall that there have been a number of difficulties about what information can be received from individuals and constituents and what Members of both Houses may then do with that information to advise or assist. Accordingly I would like to make a Statement about the effect of these rules; particularly, in terms of how they allow Members to fulfil their vital role in helping and advising those involved in family proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/3">Further to my right honourable friend Harriet Harman QC's Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-14">14 October 2004</phrase>, the proposed legislative amendments have now been made by Section 62 of the Children Act 2004, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-12">12 April 2005</phrase>. This means that:</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/4" class="indent">Section 97 (2) Children Act 1989 has been amended so that it is no longer a criminal offence to publish information which identifies or is likely to identify a child as being involved in family proceedings, or the address or school of such a child; so long as publication is not made to the general public or a section of it (including the media);</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/5" class="indent">Section 12 (4) of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 has been amended so that disclosure of certain information is no longer a contempt of court where rules of court specify that such disclosures can be made; and</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/6" class="indent">a series of amendments have been made to current rule making powers to clarify that rules can be made specifying the circumstances in which disclosure may be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/7">The Government consulted on the proposed content of the rules of court. The consultation period closed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-23">23 March 2005</phrase>. The responses have helped to shape the final content of the rules. The rules will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>. Guidance will be published ahead of that date so that the various providers and recipients of information from family proceedings involving children heard in private will know what they are entitled to do with that information.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/8">The implications for Members of both Houses are that:</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/9" class="indent">A party to family proceedings involving children heard in private will be able to communicate to a Member the text or a summary of the whole or part of a judgment given in those proceedings. Members can also receive court orders, as that had been permitted since legislative amendments came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-12">12 April 2005</phrase>. Members may use the information received for the purposes stated in the rules only. For Members, this means that once the text or summary of a judgment has been received, the Member may use that information for the purposes of giving advice, investigating any complaint or raising any question of policy or procedure. Members may of course refer the information to other appropriate bodies or agencies to fulfil the purpose. If it appears that further information is required, an application to the court will need to be made.</p>

The Army Prosecuting Authority has directed that four individuals should stand trial by court martial for the offence of the manslaughter of Ahmed Kareem, an Iraqi civilian.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.5/2">The allegation against the servicemen relates to an incident in Basra, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-08">8 May 2003</phrase>. It is alleged that the four servicemen detained four suspected looters of whom Mr Kareem was one. The servicemen allegedly punched and kicked the looters before forcing them into the Shat Al-Basra Canal. Mr Kareem could not swim and drowned.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.5/3">The cases against all four servicemen were reviewed by prosecutors of the independent Army Prosecuting Authority who applied the evidential and public interest criteria set out in the code for crown prosecutors. The Army Prosecuting Authority, following advice from highly experienced counsel, is satisfied that there is a realistic prospect of convicting all defendants and that the prosecutions are in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.5/4">The servicemen who have been directed by the Army Prosecuting Authority to stand trial before a court martial have already been informed of the charges by the Army are:</p>
	<p pid="b.75.5/5" class="indent">Sergeant Carle Nicholas Selman, (38) currently serving with the Scots Guards, currently in Germany.</p>

The Army Prosecuting Authority has directed that seven individuals should stand trial by court martial for various offences. The offences and the names of those individuals are set out below.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.6/2">The allegations against the servicemen relate to incidents in Basra, from 13 to <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-15">15 September 2003</phrase>. It is alleged that seven servicemen committed a number of offences against Iraqi detainees who had been arrested following a planned operation. One of the detainees, Baha Da'oud Salim Musa, was allegedly killed and inhumanely treated by one of these servicemen. The same serviceman is also alleged to have inhumanely treated other detainees and committed acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice. It is further alleged that two other servicemen inhumanely treated the internees, who sustained injuries following repeated assaults. One further serviceman is alleged to have assaulted a detainee. The three remaining servicemen are charged with negligently performing their duties or neglecting to perform a duty, contrary to the Army Act 1955.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.6/3">The cases against all seven servicemen were reviewed by prosecutors of the independent Army Prosecuting Authority who applied the evidential and public interest criteria set out in the code for crown prosecutors. The Army Prosecuting Authority, following advice from highly experienced counsel, is satisfied that there is a realistic prospect of convicting all defendants and that the prosecutions are in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.6/4">These offences have been directed to be tried before a court martial rather than the civilian courts.</p>

	Local Government: Three-year Revenue and Capital Grant Settlements
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-07-19b.81.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="81"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050719/text/50719-43.htm#50719-43_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.81.1/1">My honourable Friend the Minister for Local Government has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/2">I am pleased to announce the broad outline of how the Government intend to implement three-year finance settlements for local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/3">The move to three-year settlements will provide greater financial certainty and stability for local government, council tax payers, businesses and other local partners. Three-year settlements will provide local government with the same certainty and planning horizons that departments already benefit from through our reformed public spending system. They will be a vehicle for greater long-term co-ordination across central government towards local government services. The benefits for local people should be improved service delivery and greater stability in future council tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/4">In December, ODPM published a consultation paper, <i>Three-year Revenue and Capital Settlements, </i>which sought views on the Government's proposals for the implementation of three-year settlements for local government in England. The consultation fulfilled a commitment in the 2004 spending review to consult on these proposals with local government and other stakeholders with a view to agreeing settlements for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 during 2005. The consultation ended on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. Some 186 responses were received and they broadly welcomed the principle of introducing three-year allocations for revenue and capital funding. A summary of responses was published on <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> and copies have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/5">The consultation paper stated the Government's intention to move to three-year settlements for local government by the end of the current Parliament. The first settlement, to be announced in autumn 2005, will cover the two remaining years of spending review 04 (2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08). From 2008&ndash;09, three-year settlements will be fully aligned with the spending review cycle.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/6">Following consideration of the consultation responses, implementation will proceed along the following broad principles:</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/7" class="indent">a move to greater certainty in forward indications of local authority council tax levels. This will be based on further discussions with local government to ensure maximum forward looking information for council tax payers;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/8" class="indent">specific revenue grants will generally be allocated on a three-year forward basis;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/9" class="indent">for formula and revenue grant, we will align all aspects of three-year settlements with the existing spending review round, with firm three-year allocations being announced for the first full spending review cycle after three-year settlements are introduced. To make these settlements more forward looking, stable and predictable we will use projections of changes in population and council tax base; and will not; except in entirely exceptional cases, retrospectively amend any year's settlement;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/10" class="indent">capital funding, whether in the form of grant or supported borrowing, will generally be allocated on a three-year forward basis with exceptions for some small bid-based programmes, funding for emergencies and funding for large one-off projects; and</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/11" class="indent">the formulae proposed for the 2006&ndash;07 housing revenue account subsidy (HRAS) determination will remain unchanged for the 2007&ndash;08 HRAS determination. Stock and other data on individual authorities will as usual be updated for 2007&ndash;08 by means of the base data return to be issued in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/12">To ensure local authorities and council tax payers gain the maximum benefits of three-year settlements, government departments will work to ensure that their funding is either moved to a firm three-year basis or designed to offer authorities as much forward certainty as possible. The principles outlined above will be applied by government departments, in conjunction with local government, as they finalise the details of the settlement in the run up to its announcement in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.84.1/1">This Statement sets out how I intend to take forward a racial equality strategy for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/2">This Statement is all the more timely following the appalling attacks in London of <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase>. These attacks were an attack on all of us. The bombs did not discriminate and people of all faiths and none and people of all racial groups have been victims.

	<p pid="b.84.1/3">Government are determined that the atrocities will not be allowed to create tension between our communities. The good relations policy and strategic framework, with its vision of a shared and inclusive society, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-21">21 March 2005</phrase> and the racial equality strategy provide solid foundations for a future shared between and within the communities of Northern Ireland&mdash;both old and new. They provide a sound basis for a society where relationships are rooted in mutual recognition and trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/4">The Government's vision for Northern Ireland is of a society in which racial diversity is supported, understood, valued and respected: a society where racism in any of its forms is not tolerated and where we live together as a society and enjoy equality of opportunity and equal protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/5">The publication of the strategy today sets a framework for Government and all sections of civil society in Northern Ireland to contribute to achieving that vision. The framework will allow us:</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/6" class="indent">to tackle racial inequalities in Northern Ireland and to open up opportunity for all;</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/7" class="indent">to eradicate racism and hate crime; and</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/8" class="indent">together with <i>A Shared Future&mdash;Policy and Strategic Framework for Good Relations in Northern Ireland</i>, to initiate actions to promote good race relations.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/9">It sets out six shared aims that will point the strategic direction for action by departments, agencies and wider society, working individually and together, to make a significant difference to the lives of people from minority ethnic backgrounds. The aims of the strategy are: eliminating racism, equality of protection; equality of service provision; participation; dialogue and capacity building.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/10">The strategy will be taken forward through an action plan that will be developed by the Government in collaboration with the Racial Equality Forum.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/11">Government will lead by example. They will set the pace to promote racial equality through a strong public policy agenda. Ultimately, however, sustained and deeper progress depends on political stability. It will require leadership at political, civic and community levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/12">Copies of the Racial Equality Strategy for Northern Ireland have been placed in the Libraries of the House and are also available on the website at <a href="http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/raceequality">www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/raceequality</a>.</p>
