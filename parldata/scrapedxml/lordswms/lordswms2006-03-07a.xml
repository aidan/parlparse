<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-03-07a.53.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60307-50.htm#60307-50_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.53.1/1">My right honourable friend the First Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister and my right honourable friend the Minister of Communities and Local Government have made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2">Today the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is publishing a major report entitled <i>State of the English Cities</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">This is an independent report to government by a group of city experts led by Professor Michael Parkinson at Liverpool John Moores University. It is the most comprehensive study ever undertaken of England's cities and towns, looking at their performance, the challenges they face, and their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/4">It fulfils the Government's commitment in the Urban White Paper 2000, <i>Our Towns and Cities: The Future</i>, to commission a report in five years on the progress and performance of English cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/5">The report reveals that England's major cities and towns are recovering after years of decline and are once again becoming successful places to live, work and enjoy; thanks to a combination of sustained economic growth, rising public investment, and strong local leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/6">Its key finding is that England's cities are better placed than at any time since the end of 19th century to become engines of regional and national growth, creating a unique opportunity to close the economic performance gap between England's cities and the very best cities in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/7">The report focuses on 56 major towns and cities in England with populations above 125,000 people. It provides a wealth of evidence to show they are getting better. There has been a reversal in population decline, rising economic performance and employment rates, and improvements in social cohesion, liveability and integration. It shows that national policies have made a real difference, with the gap beginning to narrow between poorer neighbourhoods and the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/8">But English cities also face difficult challenges in order to develop further. While they have a higher number of jobs, they also have higher rates of worklessness. Deprivation levels are higher in cities than elsewhere in England. Most cities have seen substantial economic recovery, with northern cities picking up, but there is still more to do to catch up with the best performers in England, which trail behind their European counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/9">The report highlights that:</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/10">The rebirth of our cities has been the culmination of an enormous amount of activity and change over the past eight years with the introduction of a range of measures to tackle the underlying causes of urban decline.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/11">The establishment of the RDAs, employment action zones, an urban taskforce and the neighbourhood renewal unit, followed by policies to strengthen sustainable communities have been the backbone of a cross-Whitehall drive to reinvigorate cities and regions and to devolve decision making to the most appropriate level.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/12">Cities matter for regional and national success. The successful economic recovery of our cities must be sustained and spread more widely, within the cities themselves, throughout their regions and across the country. London is in a league of its own but all our urban areas need to continue to improve to match the European and North American best. Closing the gap remains a big challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/13">There is a need to address key drivers of economic success, notably transport, skills and land use, and to do so at the level of the &quot;city region&quot;&mdash;the economic area beyond municipal boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/14">Strong local leadership, both public and private, is crucial in helping to find new economic futures for cities, their businesses and residents. Trusting and empowering cities and local leaders is essential to delivering local, regional and national ambitions, with stronger incentives to encourage co-operative working.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/15">The <i>State of the English Cities</i> report raises a number of key policy implications for cities and regions; and for Government to build on the opportunities and tackle the challenges faced in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/16">The Government will use the evidence base provided by the report in taking forward work strengthening the urban renaissance, in the context of work being done in the Comprehensive Spending Review for 2007. It is already working with a range of cities across the country, including the eight English core cities, to help them develop &quot;business cases&quot; to deliver a step change in their economic, social and cultural performance; and the second round of city summits beyond the biggest cities to include smaller urban centres will take place from March to May this year, will help to inform this work going forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/17">The Local Government White Paper will be published later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/18">Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of the House. Further copies can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/stateofthecities">www.odpm.gov.uk/stateofthecities</a>.</p>
