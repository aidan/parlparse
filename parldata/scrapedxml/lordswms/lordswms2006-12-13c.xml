<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-12-13c.185.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="185"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61213-wms0001.htm#061213101000015">
	<p pid="c.185.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/2">I am today announcing the publication of environmental measures in new housing as part of a wider package aimed at tackling climate change by moving towards zero-carbon development. These are:</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/3">(i) a consultation document, <I>Building a Greener Future</I>;</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/4">(ii) a draft planning policy statement, <I>Planning and Climate Change</I>;</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/5">(iii) final details of the <I>Code for Sustainable Homes</I>; and</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/6">(iv) a consultation document, <I>Water Efficiency in New Buildings</I>.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/7">All these documents will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/8">As the Stern review made clear, climate change is a serious and urgent issue, and carbon emissions are the main cause. Over a quarter of the energy used in this country is used by domestic households, so to meet our goal of reducing carbon emissions by 60 per cent by 2050, we will need to ensure that new as well as existing homes are environmentally sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/9">There is also an urgent need to build more homes. Since the early 1980s we have not been building sufficient housing, market or affordable, to meet demand. On <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>, we published Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing, which aims to increase housing supply to help ensure that the growing number of households have access to decent homes at prices they can afford. But we need to make sure that the new homes are truly sustainable for the future. By 2050, these new homes will make up around a third of the stock. That is why we are publishing:</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/10">a proposed timetable to progressively improve the energy/carbon standards in building regulations, with a target to achieve zero carbon for all new homes by 2016;a new planning policy statement on climate change for consultation, so that shaping places with lower carbon emissions is at the heart of what Government expect from good planning; anda new Code for Sustainable Homes, which will provide a set of environmental standards for developers and consumers to meet on a voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/11">These measures will also promote an emerging market in environmental technologies, pushing innovation and driving costs down. A diverse energy market will mean consumers gain through lower fuel bills and warmer homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/12"><I>Building a Greener Future</I></p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/13">The consultation document <I>Building a Greener Future</I> sets out the overall strategy for moving towards zero-carbon development. It sets out the three elements: consultation on a timetable for progressively improving building regulations to achieve zero-carbon homes by 2016; a draft planning policy on climate change (see below); and, a Code for Sustainable Homes (see below).</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/14">The proposed timetable would see the energy/carbon requirements of building regulations revised to be equivalent to the following levels of the Code for Sustainable Homes:</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/15">level 3 (25 per cent improvement on 2006 regulations) in 2010</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/16">level 6 (zero carbon) in 2016</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/17">In his Pre-Budget Report 2006, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a time-limited stamp duty exemption for the vast majority of new zero-carbon homes. This exemption will provide an incentive for buyers of new homes to demand, and house builders and developers to offer, zero-carbon homes in advance of level 6 of the code becoming a mandatory standard.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/18"><I>Planning Policy Statement: Planning and Climate Change</I></p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/19">The planning system has an important role to play in setting out a framework for the location, siting and design of new development, and in helping to secure enduring progress against the UK's emissions targets. This draft PPS on climate change sets out how planning, in providing for the new homes, jobs and infrastructure needed by communities, should contribute both to the reduction of emissions and delivery of zero-carbon development, and to the shaping of sustainable communities that are resilient to climate change. We are putting tackling climate change at the centre of what we expect from good planning. This is why the new PPS will sit alongside and supplement PPS1, where we set out our core objectives for the planning system</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/20">The draft PPS sets out where and how planning can contribute most effectively. We expect to see:</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/21">planning strategies put in place that help secure progress against the UK's emissions targets<I>&mdash;</I>both by direct influence on energy use and emissions, and through bringing together and encouraging action by others.these planning strategies being tested on their carbon ambition. They should deliver patterns of urban growth that help secure the fullest possible use of sustainable transport and, overall, reduce the need to travel. New development should be located to optimise its carbon performance. It should make the most of existing and planned opportunities for decentralised, renewable and low-carbon energy supplies.real ambition in regional and local planning policies for renewable and low-carbon energy supplies. We are challenging regional planning bodies to set targets for renewable energy capacity in line with national targets, or better where possible. Applicants for renewable energy will no longer have to demonstrate the need for their project, either in general or in particular locations.a planning process that supports business innovation and engages constructively and imaginatively with developers to secure the delivery of sustainable buildings. The draft PPS sets out the vision of a planning system that underpins delivery on the ground and helps secure the sustainable development needed in all communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/22"><I>Code for Sustainable Homes</I></p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/23">We are also publishing the final version ofthe Code for Sustainable Homes, which sets environmental sustainability standards which can be applied to all homes. A consultation on the code was published in December 2005 with the Government's response to the Barker review of housing supply. The code applies only in England, although it will have implications for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/24">The revised code has six levels. Minimum standards at code level 1 are higher than the minimum mandatory standards in building regulations. There are set minimum energy/carbon efficiency andwater efficiency standards at each level. The codealso rewards other environmental considerations,such as sustainable construction materials, recycling availability, cycle spaces and home offices, with credits towards their code rating.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/25">We are proposing that assessment against the code starts for new homes in April 2007. This will put in place accreditation and assessment arrangements to ensure that new homes can voluntarily receive a code assessment from that date. We are minded to propose mandatory rating against the code of all new homes by April 2008, which we believe will encourage take-up of higher environmental standards and boost demand for environmentally friendly technologies and construction methods. A further consultation on this will follow in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/26"><I>Water efficiency in new buildings</I></p>
	<p pid="c.185.3/27">The consultation sets out proposals for setting minimum standards for water efficiency in new homes and new offices and shops. It seeks views on the approaches suggested and on the performance standards that should be set for homes and the workplace. These new regulations would provide minimum mandatory standards for water in the building regulations to underpin the minimum standards for water efficiency at level 1 of the Code for Sustainable Homes and will establish best practice in the water efficiency of offices and shops as the norm. The minimum standards would also contribute to the wider package of measures being developedby the Defra-led Water Saving Group to reduce consumer demand for water.</p>

	<p pid="c.189.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan Ryan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.189.3/2">Today I am publishing the pilot review report for project IRIS (iris recognition immigration system). IRIS is the first major deliverable of the e-borders programme. Passengers enrolled on the scheme enter the United Kingdom through an automated immigration control barrier which incorporates an iris recognition camera. Since January, more than 45,000 people have enrolled on the scheme and more than 135,000 barrier crossings have taken place. The e-borders programme is strengthening our borders and creating an integrated secure border for the21st century. Copies of <I>Project IRIS (Iris Recognition Immigration System) Pilot Review Report</I> will be available in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.190.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.3/2">The Government will make a contribution of&pound;76.6 million to help meet the basic needs of Palestinian refugees across the Middle East over the next four years. Palestinian refugees are among the very poorest people in the Middle East. Their poverty levels are increasing, particularly where affected by conflict and insecurity, such as in the Gaza Strip, where refugees make up 70 per cent of the population.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.3/3">The 4.3 million registered Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza, Jordan and Syria need healthcare, education, housing, water and sanitation. The body charged with providing these basic services is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which needs predictable funding to ensure that it can plan and prioritise its work.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.3/4">This &pound;76.6 million package of support, announced yesterday, will help ensure that UNRWA can continue to deliver services to meet the basic needs of Palestinian refugees. The funding will be used to ensure that pupils have more time at school, that graduates are trained to find jobs quicker and that small businesses have access to microfinance. By providing predictable funding over four years, DfID will enable UNRWA to plan its work better and ensure that effective help reaches those who need it the most. The funding is linked to a performance framework, developed with UNRWA and the European Community. This will enable the release of additional DfID funding as UNRWA improves its efficiency in management and service delivery. Other donors are considering a similar approach, and we will continue to work with them and UNRWA to improve the situation for Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-12-13c.191.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="191"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61213-wms0001.htm#061213101000058">
	<p pid="c.191.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.3/2">I am today announcing the reinstatement of a franchise agreement with Virgin Rail Group to operate intercity services on the west coast main line. The train operating company running services on the route will continue to be Virgin West Coast. The original franchise agreement with Virgin Rail Group provided for the operation of services between Scotland, the north-west, the Midlands and London Euston between 1997 and 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.3/3">The agreement was predicated on the assumption that Railtrack would deliver its contractual commitments, outlined in the west coast main line route modernisation programme by 2005. In response to Railtrack's failure to deliver the agreed terms of the modernisation programme, a &quot;letter agreement&quot; was put into place with Virgin West Coast in 2002. The letter agreement provided for the unique circumstances that prevented the franchise agreement being implemented. It allowed the Government to secure continued passenger services while the modernisation project could be rescued.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.3/4">The reinstatement of the franchise agreement is the last stage in the overall programme of modernisation of the west coast main line. It puts our agreement with Virgin West Coast back on a secure contractual footing and has allowed my department to secure additional public value. It incentivises the operator to reduce costs and has provided a good deal for the taxpayer and the fare payer. The franchise agreement contractualises services improvements outlined in the west coast main line progress report, published in May 2006. At the introduction of a new timetablein December 2008, there will be a significant increase in rail services between major cities and faster journeys. Services between London and Manchester and London and Birmingham will operate at 20-minute intervals all day.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.3/5">London to Scotland journey times will be further reduced by 30 minutes, so that by 2008 the journey between London and Glasgow will take four and a half hours. There will be hourly services all day between London and Liverpool, London and Preston and London and Chester.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.3/6">The agreement also transfers services between Birmingham and Scotland, currently operated by Virgin Cross Country, to Virgin West Coast from<phrase class="date" code="">11 November 2007</phrase>. From December 2008, additional and faster services will be put in place. The journey time will be further reduced by up to 30 minutes, giving an overall journey time of four hours.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.3/7">Further capacity enhancements are being examined across the rail network. My department is actively examining the needs of the passenger, the economy and the environment and will publish a high-level output specification and a longer-term framework for the railways next summer.</p>
