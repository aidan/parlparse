	Armed Forces: Compensation Schemes
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-10-11b.41.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="41"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/71011-wms0001.htm#07101122000009">
	<p pid="b.41.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/2">A review of the multiple injury lump sum element of the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces compensation scheme has been undertaken over recent weeks. The purpose of the review was to ensure that the scheme's intent of focusing benefit on the most seriously injured was being delivered. We have concluded that, while the scheme overall remains fundamentally sound, the existing rule for multiple injuries received in a single incident was not intended for the type of multiple injury cases seen today, and that it is appropriate to reinforce the focus on the most seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/3">Subject to consultation, we are proposing to amend the rule so that those with multiple injuries who qualify for 100 per cent of the guaranteed income payment (GIP), who are by definition the most seriously injured, will receive the full lump sum compensation award for each of their injuries sustained in a single incident, up to the maximum of &pound;285,000. It is also proposed that additional benefits will be conferred on those who have had their cases determined under the current rule, so that they receive the same level of compensation as those determined after the rules have been changed. Those with less serious injuries, who do not qualify for 100 per cent GIP payments, will continue to have the current rule applied to their multiple injuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/4">The proposal has the full support of the service Chiefs of Staff. We are now consulting the members of the Central Advisory Committee, the statutory consultative body which advises on war pension and compensation issues, before finalising arrangements and making the necessary changes to the secondary legislation to put the new rule in place at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.3/7">The council is expected to discuss civil protection capabilities following recent forest fires in southern Europe.

	<p pid="b.41.3/8">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/9"><I>EU-Russia </I><I>s</I><I>ummit preparations</I></p>

The council is likely to adopt conclusions on the deployment of a possible peacekeeping force to Chad and the Central African Republic under the European security and defence policy. The conclusions are also expected to reiterate the EU's support for Darfur's political process, particularly the peace talks in Libya starting on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>, rapid deployment of the UN/AU hybrid peacekeeping force, and the EU's readiness to consider further measures against any party who obstructs this process.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.3/18"><I>Western Balkans</I></p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/19">The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Carla Del Ponte, is expected to brief the council on Serbia's co-operation with ICTY. The June council conclusions made clear that full co-operation by the Serb Government with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia remains a requirement for the conclusion of the stabilisation and association agreement. The Government fully support this position.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/20">The council is also expected to discuss ways in which the EU can support the negotiations on Kosovo's final status, and to adopt conclusions expressing full support for ongoing efforts by the EU/Russia/US troika to reach agreement between Belgrade and Pristina on a status settlement. The council is also expected to adopt conclusions on the signature of the stabilisation and association agreement with Montenegro and expressing the EU's support for High Representative Miroslav Lajcak and his efforts to advance key reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

	<p pid="b.41.3/21"><I>Libya</I></p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/22">The External Relations Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, is expected to update the council on plans for an EU/Libya framework agreement. The council is expected to adopt conclusions giving the Commission a mandate to take this forward. The Government believe that the EU should move quickly towards a formalised relationship with Libya, which will help secure progress in areas of mutual interest, such as combating illegal migration.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/23"><I>Middle East</I></p>

	<p pid="b.41.3/25">The council is likely to discuss Lebanon in light of the political tensions surrounding the Lebanese parliamentary elections and the recent assassination of MP Antoine Ghanem on <phrase class="date" code="">19 September</phrase>. The council is expected to adopt conclusions on Lebanon, which the Government support, condemning the assassination of MP Antoine Ghanem and urging agreement on a consensus presidential candidate through dialogue. The conclusions are also likely to welcome the end of fighting between the army and extremist militants in the Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp, and support Lebanon's reconstruction efforts in the damaged camp.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/26"><I>Iran</I></p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/27">The council is expected to discuss steps that the EU can take to support the agreed twin-track international approach to the Iranian nuclear issue. This includes discussions between the high representative for common foreign and security policy, Javier Solana, and Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, and incremental sanctions against Iran for continued defiance of the will of the international community, as set out in UN Security Council Resolutions 1696, 1737 and 1747.

	<p pid="b.45.1/1">In my reply on <phrase class="date" code="">23 July</phrase> to the Question from my noble friend Lord Judd, I incorrectly stated that the UK's contribution to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was &pound;98 million (<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WA 71</I>). I regret the error and my corrected Answer is given below:</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/2">The UK is not in a position to assess the numbers of Iraqi refugees in Syria who have been victims of torture. We have not had any discussions on this issue with either the UNHCR or the Government of Syria.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/3">The UK continues to support the UNHCR's leading role in providing humanitarian support to Iraq refugees in Syria. In 2006 the UK contributed approximately $52 million (approximately &pound;26 million) to support the work of the UNHCR worldwide, including in Syria. In addition, officials from our embassy in Damascus have visited the UNHCR refugee reception centre in Damascus to assess the conditions there. We are now looking at supporting a range of projects aimed at improving conditions for Iraqi refugees, specifically in the areas of education and healthcare.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.3/1">My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/2">In a Written Ministerial Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>, the previous Economic Secretary undertook to report to Parliament on a quarterly basis on the operation of the UK's asset freezing regime. This is the fourth of these reports and covers the period July-September 2007. <sup>(</sup><sup>1</sup><sup>)</sup></p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/3"><I>Asset-freezing designations</I></p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/4">In the quarter July-September 2007, the Treasury made eight domestic designations under the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006. None of these was a person already designated under earlier orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/5">The terrorism order and the al-Qaeda and Taliban order provide, where appropriate, for designations to be made confidentially and with restricted circulation of notice. Six persons were designated on this basis in this quarter.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/6">Four persons were designated on the basis of closed source material provided by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/7">There were no financial sanctions listings at the EU or the UN in relation to terrorism or al-Qaeda and the Taliban of persons with links to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/8">A total of 284 separate accounts and approximately &pound;625,000<sup>(</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>)</sup> of suspected terrorist funds have been frozen in the UK since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/9"><I>Reviews</I></p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/10">The Treasury keeps domestic asset-freezing cases under review. A number of formal reviews have been initiated in this quarter and the review of one case was completed. In this case a decision was taken to delist the designated person.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/11"><I>Litigation</I></p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/12">An application under Article 5(4) of the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 for an order to set aside a designation was lodged at the High Court on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-21">21 August 2007</phrase> by a designated person. Three other applications to set aside have subsequently been received on behalf of designated persons, who have sought to join them to the first application. A directions hearing which will cover all four cases is scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-12">12 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/13"><I>Licensing policy</I></p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/14">In accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1452 (2002), the Treasury operates a licensing system whereby designated persons and others are able to apply to make or receive payments under specific and, if necessary, monitored conditions. In this quarter, the following licences were issued:</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/15">11 listed persons were granted legal expenses licences;13 listed persons were granted basic expenses licences&mdash;two of which were for benefits payments; andfive listed persons were granted extraordinary expenses licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/16">In addition, the households of four listed persons were granted benefits licences in accordance with the policy set out in the previous Economic Secretary's Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July 2006</phrase> to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/17" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The detail that can be provided to the House on a quarterly basis is subject to the need to avoid the identification, directly or indirectly, of personal or operationally sensitive information.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.3/18" class="indent"><sup>(2)</sup> This figure includes approximately $58,000 of suspected terrorist funds frozen in the UK. This has been converted using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in the exchange rate may impact on the contribution this sum makes to future totals of suspected terrorist funds frozen.</p>
