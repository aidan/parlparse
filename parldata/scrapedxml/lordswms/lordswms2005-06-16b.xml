	Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005: Report to Parliament
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-06-16b.59.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050616/text/50616-25.htm#50616-25_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.59.1/1">My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/2">Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires me to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on my exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/3">The 2005 Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. During the first three months of the operation of the Act, I made 11 non-derogating control orders. Ten control orders were made on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase> under Section 3(1)(b) and (c) of the 2005 Act in respect of individuals who were at that time certified under Section 21(1) of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (the 2001 Act.). A further order was made with the permission of the court under Section 3(1)(a) of the 2005 Act on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-26">26 April 2005</phrase>&mdash;again in respect of an individual who was formerly certified under Section 21(1) of the 2001 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/4">I have modified these orders to authorise a change of address in three instances: to give effect to the court's ruling following an appeal&mdash;see below; to give access to further family members in one case; and to clarify the wording of certain obligations in the control orders on two further occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/5">A right of appeal exists in Section 10 of the 2005 Act against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an obligation contained in a control order. One of those subject to a control order has exercised his right of appeal under this section and has had his appeal upheld. His order has since been varied to substitute different obligations on him.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/6">Section 14(2) of the 2005 Act requires the Secretary of State to appoint a person to review the operation of that Act. Lord Carlile of Berriew QC was appointed as the independent reviewer of the 2005 Act on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>.</p>

	Local Government Pension Scheme

	<p pid="b.59.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/2">In a Statement issued on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-18">18 March</phrase>, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he was establishing a tripartite committee with key stakeholders, to discuss the future of the local government pension scheme. The first meeting of the tripartite committee, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, subsequently met on <phrase class="date" code="">24 May</phrase> and was attended by representatives of the local authority employers and the trades unions.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/3">The committee will focus on the development and modernisation of the scheme and will consider the measures which need to be put in place to ensure the scheme's affordability and sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/4">The Government believe that local authority employees should have a stable, strong pension scheme in which they can have confidence. It is important, however, that the balance is right between, on the one hand, the cost of the scheme to the taxpayer, and, on the other hand, the value of the benefits which the scheme offers to current and future pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/5">Further meetings of the committee are now being arranged to ensure the implementation of essential decisions about the scheme's long term future.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-14">14 June 2005</phrase> I made an order under Section 2 (6) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 amalgamating a number of divisions in Northamptonshire, Tyne and Wear and Greater London with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>, as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.60.1/5">All the amalgamations were made at the request of the general commissioners in all the divisions with the aim of improving the organisational efficiency of the divisions concerned. I have placed a copy of the order amalgamating the divisions in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.3/1">Today I have deposited copies of the report on the review of statutory prohibitions on disclosure in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.3/2">The review stems from the order-making power in Section 75 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to remove or relax statutory prohibitions on disclosure. The report gives details of all the provisions examined during the course of the review and sets out the Government's intention in relation to each of them. Of the 183 provisions which were reviewed and found to be within the scope of the power, 13 have already been amended using that power, and a further 59 will be repealed, amended or time-limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.3/3">The Government will continue to assess the scope for further amendments or repeals to the remaining prohibitions on disclosure. Beginning in 2005, the Government will prepare and bring forward a series of orders under Section 75 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, giving effect to the commitments made in this report.</p>

I am also appointing seven new commissioners: Jonathan Bell, Thomas Duncan, Professor Colin Harvey, Alan Henry, Ann Hope, Eamonn O'Neill and Geraldine Rice.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/3">These new appointments will join the existing two commissioners, Lady Christine Eames and Kevin McLoughlin, who were reappointed last autumn to serve until December 2007. The appointments follow an open recruitment process based on merit. The new chief commissioner and seven new commissioners will take up their posts in the early autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/4">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is a key part of the architecture of human rights protections in Northern Ireland, and an important feature of the Belfast agreement. The Government have consistently been clear that it is in all our interests to have a strong, independent and self-confident commission which draws support from all parts of the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/5">I am confident that these new appointments will ensure that the commission will make a significant contribution to the advancement and protection of human rights in Northern Ireland in the coming months and years. I look forward to working with the new commission.</p>
