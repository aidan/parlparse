	<p pid="b.59.3/1">Today I have deposited copies of the report on the review of statutory prohibitions on disclosure in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/2">The review stems from the order-making power in Section 75 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to remove or relax statutory prohibitions on disclosure. The report gives details of all the provisions examined during the course of the review and sets out the Government's intention in relation to each of them. Of the 183 provisions which were reviewed and found to be within the scope of the power, 13 have already been amended using that power, and a further 59 will be repealed, amended or time-limited.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.3/3">The Government will continue to assess the scope for further amendments or repeals to the remaining prohibitions on disclosure. Beginning in 2005, the Government will prepare and bring forward a series of orders under Section 75 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, giving effect to the commitments made in this report.</p>
