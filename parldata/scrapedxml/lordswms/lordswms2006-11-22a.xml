	<p pid="a.56.3/1">My right honourable friend the Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/2">The Government propose to introduce legislation in the 2007 Finance Bill to take effect from<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-22">22 November 2006</phrase>, in response to disclosures of schemes which undermine the effectiveness of legislation enacted in the Finance Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/3">The legislation will prevent companies from exploiting a mismatch in definitions of ownership of a company or manipulating the balance-sheet value of assets to reduce or cancel the effect of the 2006 legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/4">Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2006 targeted sales to loss-making groups of lessor companies that were about to become tax profitable. The sales turned an acceptable tax-timing advantage into an unacceptable permanent deferral of tax. The legislation gave a clear signal that this was not acceptable. The disclosures show that some groups are willing to enter into contrived schemes to side-step the 2006 legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/5">The Government have decided to act promptly in response to the disclosures, to emphasise that attempts by companies to avoid paying their fair share of tax are not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/6">A copy of today's HMRC technical note giving the relevant background to this measure has been deposited in the Libraries and is accessible on the HMRC website at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">www.hmrc.gov.uk/</a>.</p>
