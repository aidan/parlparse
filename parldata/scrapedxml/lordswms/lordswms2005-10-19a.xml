	Health, Work and Well-being
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-10-19a.53.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51019-39.htm#51019-40_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.53.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health and I have today published a paper &quot;Health, Work and Wellbeing&mdash;Caring for our future: A strategy for the health and wellbeing of working age people&quot;. The report has been placed in the Library and copies are available for honourable Members in the Vote Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2">With a 10 per cent reduction in accidents at work since 1997, the UK today has one of the best health and safety records in the world. Yet 40 million working days are still lost every year to occupational ill health and injury, and a third of those coming onto incapacity benefit come from work.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">In a modern world where rising dependency ratios and global market forces place an ever greater burden on those of working age in supporting others. For the sake of the individual and their family, and for the well-being of our overall economy, we cannot afford to stand back and allow those with moderate health or disability challenges to be written off.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/4">This strategy is a crucial part of delivering on the Government's commitment to improving the health and well-being of the working age population. This is a central element of our wider welfare reform agenda and is set out in the White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health: Making Healthier Choices Easier&quot;. It helps to make a reality of the Health and Safety Commission's Strategy for Workplace Health and Safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/5">Underpinned by a ground-breaking partnership between my department (including the Health and Safety Commission/Executive) and the Department of Health, this strategy will enable us to work with all our partners across and outside government to take the first steps in breaking the link between ill-health and inactivity. It will advance the prevention of ill-health and injury, encourage good management of occupational health and transform opportunities for people to recover from illness while at work, maintaining their independence and their sense of worth.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/6">This is an ambitious agenda&mdash;far more stretching than any commitments of previous governments and more wide-ranging&mdash;placing responsibility not just in the hands of government, but with employers, individuals, the healthcare profession and all our stakeholders. It will be led by a new national Director for Occupational Health and include the creation of a National Charter for Health, Work and Wellbeing, setting out the contribution of all stakeholders in delivering this transformation in occupational health.</p>

	NHS: Specialist Services
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-10-19a.55.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="55"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51019-39.htm#51019-40_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.55.1/1">I am today setting up of a review aimed at helping the National Health Service plan and pay for specialised services which include some of the most expensive treatments and drugs provided in the NHS. Patients expect to experience equal access to specialised services in the NHS and it may be necessary to strengthen collective commissioning arrangements between primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/2">The new taskforce, headed by Scotland's former Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir David Carter, will investigate how the NHS currently commissions specialised services and consider ways of tightening these commissioning arrangements so that there is greater consistency across the NHS. The review will also look at ways of ensuring primary care trusts work together to commission specialised services so that the financial risk is shared. It will consider whether the balance is right between PCT commissioning collaboration and a more national or regional commissioning approach. The review team will report to Ministers in spring 2006.</p>
