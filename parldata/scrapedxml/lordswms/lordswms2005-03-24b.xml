The targets build upon progress made by the agency since it formed on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase> and reflect the importance of achieving joint personnel administration implementation while maintaining current outputs. Furthermore they provide customers with assurance that, in focusing on joint personnel administration and higher profile services such as pay and pensions, AFPAA will continue to give sufficient attention to the broad range of other outputs.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.3/3">To Deliver Pay</p>
	<p pid="b.43.3/4" class="indent">To make 99.9 per cent of all pay payments by the due date (excluding late payments caused by events determined to be outside the control of the agency).</p>

	<p pid="b.43.3/9">To Support the delivery of Joint Personnel Administration Programme</p>
	<p pid="b.43.3/10" class="indent">Achieve live service to the RAF by end March 2006. Live service to the RN and Army are to follow by end August 2006 and by end December 2006 respectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/2">I am pleased to be able to announce that new regulations governing the payment of financial assistance to reservists and their employers during mobilisation were laid before Parliament today and that subject to parliamentary scrutiny are due to come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-14">14 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/3">These changes represent a significant improvement in the assistance available to reservists and employers. They reaffirm our continuing commitment to the Reserve Forces and reflect the value we place on them and their contribution to the United Kingdom's defence commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/4">These regulations have been prepared following a comprehensive consultation process, which I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-22">22 July 2004</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>62 WS</i>). They replace the previous complex and intrusive scheme which only matched individuals' earnings up to a rank-related threshold or band, with a separate hardship award scheme for those whose earnings exceeded the band for their rank. Payments to employers under that scheme were limited and complex.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/5">The full detail of the scheme of both reservists and employers are available in the documents laid before the House. I also propose that the financial limit shall be subject to annual review commencing in April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/2">In my previous Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-16">16 September 2004</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>162 WS</i>) I gave an undertaking to keep the House informed of the progress with regard to the creation of the Ministry of Defence Medal Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/3">I am pleased to report that on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase> I officially opened the MoD Medal Office which is now established at a single location within the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) at Innsworth, Gloucester.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/4">The change from separate offices for each service to the new office is affording the opportunity to adopt common procedures based upon best practice. The significant investment in personnel, laser engraving and computer technology has already led to a substantial reduction in the backlog of medals assessment and engraving and underlines the priority and commitment the MoD attaches to the prompt delivery of medals to veterans, their relatives and serving personnel. Indeed, since the introduction of a new laser engraving facility at Innsworth, around 40,000 extra medals have been handed out to recipients.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/5">AFPAA assumed full responsibility for the management of medal output, target setting and performance monitoring with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> and has successfully filled all of the 61 medal-related posts. While the introduction of the Suez Canal zone and Iraq medals has resulted in unprecedented numbers of medal applications (117,425 since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-10">10 April 2004</phrase>), the backlog for the Canal zone medal today is 13,275 compared with 21,371 as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-24">24 September 2004</phrase> and for the Iraq medal is 13,382 compared with 25,178.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.1/6">The formation of the MoD Medal Office is already producing significant benefits and I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the single service medal offices and the MoD Medal Office for their part in bringing about this improvement.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Geoffrey Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.3/2">I am pleased to announce that the Ministry of Defence has agreed a heads of agreement with Agusta Westland which commits us to working together towards a long-term partnering and business transformation arrangement. Although the details are subject to further negotiation with the company over the coming months, we expect this to provide significant efficiency and effectiveness improvements in how we support our helicopter fleet.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.3/3">Competition remains the cornerstone of our procurement policy. This applies to our future rotorcraft capability requirements, as elsewhere, in particular for the land lift (medium) element. As the defence industrial policy makes clear, however, value for money judgments can sometimes suggest different approaches. Since the Agusta Westland future Lynx project has already benefited from extensive assessment work and de-risking, it would be our preferred procurement option for meeting the land find and maritime (surface) attack element. This is, however, subject to continuing negotiations with the company to agree acceptable contract conditions and prices, which must meet clearly defined parameters.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.3/4">This approach is excellent news for Agusta Westland, for the highly skilled staff at its Yeovil plant, and for the British defence industry. Other key partners include Smiths Industries in Cheltenham and Thales(UK) in Raynes Park and Taunton, GD(UK) in St Leonards-on-Sea and South Dorset Engineering Ltd in Weymouth.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.3/5">We believe that, subject to negotiating the precise commercial details, the future Lynx represents a highly capable, value for money, solution to our requirement. We expect to make a final &quot;main gate&quot; procurement decision later this year. The contract is potentially worth over &pound;1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.3/6">This is a key first milestone for the future rotorcraft capability programme, and is part of the commitment we made in last year's supplement to the defence White Paper to invest some &pound;3 billion in our helicopter fleet.</p>

	<p pid="b.48.3/21">In addition to the above targets I have asked that, as part of its efficiency promise, the service looks to reduce the costs of accommodation and procurement by 8 per cent by <phrase class="date" code="">31 April 2006</phrase> from the 2003&ndash;04 baseline, and further reduce the costs of redundancy payment processing by 2.5 per cent by <phrase class="date" code="">31 April 2006</phrase>. Overall I have asked the service to produce efficiency gains of at least &pound;6 million over the period to 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.3/22">The service will also be seeking re-accreditation to the Investors in People standard by January 2006. The service is also required to meet centrally promulgated targets relating to replying to correspondence from honourable Members, reducing the level of sick absence and processing payments to suppliers. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> the service's case administration work has been funded by its fee income and the service is also required to ensure that it balances its costs and income over a three-year period.</p>
