	<p pid="a.59.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">Changes to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 for England came into force today introducing a new permitted development right to help mitigate the current increased risk of avian influenza (&quot;bird flu&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3">Following the recent outbreak of avian influenza on a farm in Suffolk, Defra has taken measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including the culling of all birds on the infected premises, putting in place a three kilometre protection zone and a 10 kilometre surveillance zone around the infected area and a restriction zone covering approximately 2090km2 of north-east Suffolk and south-east Norfolk. In all of those zones, bird keepers are required to house their birds or, if that is not practical, otherwise isolate them from contact with wild birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/4">In order to help deal with the current increased risk of avian influenza nationwide, the Government have decided to assist poultry farmers and owners of other captive birds by granting planning permission in the whole of England for temporary and reversible works to shelter poultry and other captive birds from contact with wild birds. Landowners will be allowed to erect a building with a ground area of up to 465 square metres, or extend an existing building by up to 50 per cent. Any such development will be permitted to remain standing for as long as it is necessary to protect poultry and other captive birds from avian influenza, but not beyond 12 months. After such time, the structures will either need to be removed and the land restored to its original condition or to any condition as agreed between the local planning authority and the developer or planning permission for a permanent structure will need to be sought.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/5">The amendment will also cover conservation areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks. Legislation protecting listed buildings and sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) will continue to apply.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/2">The Government announced last year that restrictions on smoking in enclosed workplaces, public places and vehicles would be introduced in England from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase>. These provisions are described in the Health Act 2006 which aims to act on medical and scientific advice. This will save thousands of lives over the next decade by reducing both exposure to hazardous second-hand smoke and overall smoking rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/3">The Health Act 2006 includes provisions designed to prohibit smoking in enclosed public places and vehicles, but does not cover vessels operating at sea or on inland waters. I now intend to introduce similar provisions to provide protection from second-hand smoke for people on vessels operating in UK waters, both at sea and on inland waterways.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-14">14 February</phrase>, I launched a consultation paper asking for comments as to how smoke free provisions should be implemented on sea-going and inland-waterways vessels. The provisions under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 will apply to all vessels operating in UK inland waters or within the 12 mile territorial waters, regardless of which country they are flagged with, provided they carry passengers or employees. I am also keen to see these provisions extended to Wales and Northern Ireland and for a consistent set of restrictions to be established in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/5">In line with the Health Act 2006, I am proposing that owners and operators of vessels may provide for residents and guests on merchant ships to be allowed to continue smoking in an entirely private area of residential accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/6">I am also proposing that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency holds the responsibility for enforcement of these provisions with a scale of penalties similar to those laid down in the Health Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/7">Copies of the consultation paper have been sent to a wide range of representatives in the shipping industry and they will have 12 weeks to respond to the consultation. Further copies of the consultation paper are available on the DfT website at <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk">www.dft.gov.uk</a>. Copies have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.3/3">The first and main item is preparation for the spring European Council, which will be held on the 8-<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-09">9 March 2007</phrase>. The key messages paper, prepared by the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee, identifies the key messages emerging from the various other reports for adoption and endorsement at the March Council. The key messages paper will be adopted following a policy debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/4">The second item is an information point from the presidency on the content of the tripartite social summit. This will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March</phrase> in advance of the spring European Council to allow the European social partners to feed in their views to the spring Council. Attendees are the current presidency, the two subsequent presidencies (Portugal and Slovenia), the Commission and the social partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/5">The Council will also deal with the opportunities and challenges of demographic change in Europe. The exchange of views on <I>Structuring the European Debate on Demographic Change</I> will be the main discussion on the Council's agenda. I shall insist that Europe should avoid the temptation to set up new or duplicate processes at EU level where perfectly good mechanisms already exist. We need to place any new actions we take within the context of achieving greater growth and jobs and the existing open method of co-ordination. Within the context of demographic change in Europe, the Council will also be asked to adopt a resolution on the contribution of older people to economic and social development.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/6">Under any other business, there is a Commission presentation on the <I>New Community Strategy on Health and Safety at Work 2007-2013</I>, which we expect to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February</phrase>. Also, the committee chairs will give an oral presentation of the 2007 work programmes of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee. The Council is informed annually about the committees' work programmes.</p>

Currently, relief from stamp duty is available for intermediaries that trade securities listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) only if they are members of the LSE and they report their trades to the LSE. This will allow new providers of transaction reporting services to enter the market more easily. The Government are today publishing draft clauses for consultation in advance of this year's Finance Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/4">Secondly, the Government are announcing that, in addition to shares admitted to trading on a regulated market, they also intend to extend this approach to include shares admitted to trading on a multilateral trading facility (MTF). Currently, in order to benefit from stamp duty relief, intermediaries trading in such securities are required to report transactions to the market on which the securities are admitted to trade. The Government intend to remove this requirement, in order further to extend choice in transaction reporting. However, before proceeding with this proposal, the Government are providing time for the Financial Services Authority to consider fully any possible regulatory implications from this change and will provide an update on progress at the pre-Budget report.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/5">Thirdly, the Government also propose to modernise the definition of a recognised stock exchange for tax purposes to allow shares traded on other regulated markets under MiFID to benefit from the same tax arrangements that currently apply only to the LSE in the UK. For example, this will allow shares listed by the UK Listing Authority and traded on a regulated market under MiFID to be held in an individual savings account or to meet the listing requirement to be a UK real estate investment trust. The Government will publish draft clauses in advance of this year's Finance Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/6">Taken together, these changes will help expand choice and increase competition in the provision of services to trade financial instruments in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/7">The Government have been a leading proponent of the need to improve competition and efficiency in Europe's securities markets for three reasons:</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/8">first, to ensure that capital markets play their full role in financing the long-term investment needs of the wider economy as efficiently as possible; secondly, to liberalise the provision of services to trade financial instruments within the EU so that successful firms and financial centres such as London can benefit from these opportunities within the European single market; thirdly, to ensure that the UK's markets and related services remain competitive internationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/9">The Government have supported the introduction of greater competition through MiFID. The UK is the only major financial centre in the European Union to transpose the MiFID by the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January</phrase>. This gives UK-based financial firms the maximum time to prepare for the impact of the new trading environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/10">Today's announcement removes other unnecessary non-regulatory obstacles to greater competition in trading financial instruments by modernising the tax system to bring it closer into line with the liberalised regulatory environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/11">These announcements today coincide with an informal meeting of the high level group on City competitiveness, during which senior figures from the UK-based financial services sector met European Commissioners Charlie McCreevy and Neelie Kroes to discuss the future direction of financial services policy in Europe, including developments in trading securities.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.3/15">The change in DEL &pound;68,798,000 relates to the draw down of end-year flexibility &pound;61,303,000 of which is &pound;36,900,000 is near-cash resource and &pound;24,403,000 is non-cash. The department is also receiving net budget transfers from other Northern Ireland departments of &pound;2,547,000k resource and &pound;24,000 capital. Also, the department has increased its DEL as a result of a swap from AME budget of &pound;3,500,000. As DEL stated excludes depreciation, the change is adjusted by &pound;1,424,000 to &pound;68,798,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.3/16">The cash drawdown is required to fund additional pressures declared during the year in areas such as central administration, political directorate, and criminal justice directorate. The non-cash element is mainly required to create provision for potential liabilities in Compensation Agency, Youth Justice Agency, and the NI Prison Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.3/1">My honourable friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr John Healey) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2">Subject to parliamentary approval of any necessary supplementary estimate, HM Treasury resource DEL will be reduced by &pound;6,939,000 from &pound;247,599,000 to &pound;240,660,000. The administration budget will be reduced by &pound;4,465,000 from &pound;167,794,000 to &pound;163,329,000. Within the DEL change, the impact on the voted and non-voted elements and near-cash are as set out in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.84.3/16">The reduction in the resource element of the DEL arises from a machinery of government change transfer of &pound;6,940,000 following the transfer of budgetary responsibility for the salaries and pensions of UK members of the European Parliament from the Treasury to the Cabinet Office, to align with the policy responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/17">The net reduction in the administration budget arises from a transfer of &pound;4,465,000 from RfR 1: &quot;Raising the rate of sustainable growth and achieving rising prosperity and a better quality of life, with economic and employment opportunities for all&quot; to RfR 2 &quot;Cost-effective management of the supply of coins and actions to protect the integrity of coinage&quot; to partially offset an increase in programme spending due to increased metal prices and increased demand for coinage.</p>
