	Civil and Family Court Fees
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-10-10a.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51010-40.htm#51010-40_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.1.1/1">The Department for Constitutional Affairs has published a consultation paper, which sets out proposals for increases to certain civil and family court fees. The purpose of the consultation is to identify whether the package of proposed increases is the most apt to meet the need to increase fee income and to cover costs and seek views on whether a particular increase in an individual fee might have specific untoward consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and can also be obtained free on the department's website at the following web address: <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/civilfam/civilfam.htm">www.dca.gov.uk/consult/civilfam/civilfam.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">The closing date for consultation is <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase>.</p>

	Conditional Fee Agreements

	<p pid="a.1.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-10">10 August 2005</phrase> I published the department's response to the consultation paper <i>Making Simple CFAs a Reality,</i> published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-29">29 June 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/2">The paper <i>New Regulation for CFAs: A summary of responses to the consultation paper &quot;Making Simple CFAs a Reality&quot;&mdash;DCA's conclusions and new regulations </i>sets out the department's conclusions on the simplification of the CFAs and related secondary legislation. The paper includes drafts of the regulations (which have now been laid as the the Conditional Fee Agreements (Revocation) Regulations 2005 and the Access to Justice (Membership Organisation) Regulations 2005), which revoke the current secondary legislation governing CFAs, collective conditional fee agreement regulations (CCFA) and a new set of simplified membership organisation regulations. These regulations will be laid before Parliament separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/3">The current CFA regulations are unnecessarily complex and opaque and duplicate regulation already performed by the Law Society. Removing unnecessary regulation will apply to all CFAs which are used across a range of civil cases and will put into place the Government's commitment to introduce better regulation and strip out unnecessary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/4">The existing CFA and CCFA regulations will be revoked and the new simplified membership organisation regulations will be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-01">1 November 2005</phrase>. The primary legislation (Section 27 of the Access to Justice Act 1999) will provide the minimum government legislative framework needed for the use of CFAs by legal representatives. Primary responsibility for client care will be focused on solicitors through the Law Society's regulation. The DCA has been working closely with the Law Society on improvements to its guidance and rules and the Law Society plans to amend its rules and publish new CFA model agreements to coincide with the changes to regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/5">Copies of the paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It is also available on the Department for Constitutional Affairs' website at <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk">www.dca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

In accordance with the established procedure, all the nominations have been approved by the Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/2">The Government made the nominations following the usual consultation process with local and regional government.

	UN World Summit
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.4.1/1">The 2005 UN World Summit took place in New York from 14 to <phrase class="date" code="">16 September</phrase>. My right honourable friends the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for International Development and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs attended for the Government. At the initiative of the UK and other UN member states, the summit included a session devoted to financing for development.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/2">Overall, the summit delivered a worthwhile package of reforms and commitments. The full text of the outcome document is available at <a href="http://www.un.org/summit2005">www.un.org/summit2005</a>. Negotiations on the document were at times difficult, reflecting the ambitious agenda and divergence of views between UN member states on several issues. As EU presidency, the UK played an important role in these negotiations. Follow-up work is now under way in several areas to implement the agreements reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/3">The reforms agreed included:</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/4" class="indent">agreement on the responsibility to protect, acknowledging that the international community should act if states fail to protect their populations from the worst atrocities: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity;</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/5" class="indent">good language on development and climate change, with several important Gleneagles outcomes endorsed and new EU commitments welcomed by the broader UN membership. These include the need to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals and to address the special needs of Africa;</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/6" class="indent">agreement to create by the end of this year a new peacebuilding commission, to close an institutional gap in the UN's conflict architecture and assist countries emerge from conflict;</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/7" class="indent">agreement to establish a new Human Rights Council, to replace the much-maligned Commission for Human Rights;</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/8" class="indent">endorsement of further work to strengthen UN effectiveness in operational activities for tackling humanitarian crises and to ensure more coherent international institutional arrangements for environmental action;</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/9" class="indent">endorsement of UN Secretariat reforms under way and a mandate to the Secretary-General to make proposals for further reforms in such areas as ethics, accountability/oversight and financial and human resource management; and</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/10" class="indent">unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestation and, separately, unanimous adoption by the Security Council of the UK's Security Council resolution to prohibit by law incitement of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/11">In some areas the outcome text did not meet our aspirations. Stronger language on terrorism, stating that the targeted killing of civilians is never justified and constitutes an act of terrorism, proved out of reach. Efforts to secure strong language on non-proliferation and disarmament (following disappointment at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference) were unsuccessful. The EU pushed for more extensive reforms of the UN Secretariat. Furthermore, opposition from some countries prevented more detailed modalities being agreed for the new Human Rights Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/12">Some have criticised the summit's outcome document as modest. However, as the Prime Minister said in his speech at the summit, &quot;if we did what we have agreed on doubling aid, on opening up trade, on debt relief, on HIV/AIDS and malaria, on conflict prevention so that never again would the world stand by, helpless when genocide struck, our modesty would surprise. There would be more democracy, less oppression. More freedom, less terrorism. More growth, less poverty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/13">The Government are committed to the full and early implementation of the reforms. We will continue to work towards achieving reforms where we wanted to see greater progress.</p>
