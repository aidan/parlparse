	<p pid="a.24.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/2">Sudan remains a priority for the UK Government. The Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are jointly supporting the Government of Sudan to implement the Darfur peace agreement (DPA) signed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May</phrase> and to deliver development in Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/3">Together with our international partners, we call on the Government of Sudan and SLM-Minni Minnawi to implement the agreement without delay. We are providing support for immediate implementation needs, including assistance for the African Union (AU) to publicise the DPA and its benefits on the ground. The UK is also engaged with the Darfur joint assessment mission on recovery and development. We are disappointed that the SLM/A Abdel Wahid faction and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) have not signed the DPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/4">The African Union (AU) troops continue to do an important and much needed job in seeking to ease the suffering of the people of Darfur, but they need to be replaced by a UN peacekeeping operation. The Sudanese Government have not yet agreed to this. Kofi Annan is explicit that he wants a UN force in Darfur; the Security Council has taken a strong line. The African Union wants such a force, as do many leading African countries. We will continue to press the Government of Sudan to accept it and call on others to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/5">Lord Triesman, the Minister for Africa, attended the AU summit on 1 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-02">2 July</phrase> in Banjul to push for faster progress in implementing the DPA and for an early handover from AMIS to the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/6">The UK will be represented at an AU donors' conference on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-18">18 July</phrase> in Brussels. We are encouraging the AU and other participants to use the conference to address how the AU and the international community can help to take forward the Darfur peace agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-23">Friday 23 June</phrase>, the Government of Sudan publicly began disarming a small group of Janjaweed in south Darfur, witnessed by UK and US embassy representatives. We welcome this step and will call on the Government to continue this work and to present a plan for neutralising and disarming the Janjaweed/armed militias, as they are required to do under the Darfur peace agreement (DPA).</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-25">25 June</phrase>, the Sudanese Government suspended all UN activity in Darfur apart from humanitarian assistance from the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF. They lifted the suspension the following day. This had some impact on the UN's humanitarian work in west Darfur, but minimal disruption elsewhere. It was a provocative act by the Sudanese Government in response to the UN helping a prominent Darfur rebel. The Government of Sudan should allow UN humanitarian agencies and NGOs unimpeded access in Darfur. Some 3.6 million people are affected by the conflict, of whom 2 million are internally displaced persons (IDPs). The UK is the second biggest bilateral humanitarian donor to the Darfur crisis (after the US), contributing over &pound;126 million since September 2003. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May</phrase>, I announced a further &pound;9 million to the multi-donor Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), bringing our total allocation to &pound;49 million this year. The UK is now providing more to the UN work plan in 2006 than in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/9">We are concerned about the IDPs in Darfur and the temporary cutting of rations by the World Food Programme (WFP). The WFP was forced to halve its rations in Darfur in May due to lack of funding, but rations have now been improved to 84 per cent as a result of recent US and Government of Sudan contributions (20,000 metric tonnes of cereals). We welcome this announcement, as it comes at a critical time in the year, with the rainy season starting in Darfur. The full ration will be restored by October and we are working with the UN and the largest food aid donors (EU and US) to ensure that shortfalls are prevented in the future. The UK is also funding nutritional safety net programmes to mitigate the impact of reduced rations on the most vulnerable in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/10">We condemn the continuing cross-border attacks from Darfur into eastern Chad, which have led to the displacement of 50,000 Chadians within Chad and further numbers fleeing across the border into Darfur. Eastern Chad now hosts 200,000 refugees from Darfur, and there are 45,000 from the Central African Republic in the south. Further insecurity in eastern Chad would have very serious humanitarian implications. The UK is providing &pound;4 million in humanitarian assistance in 2006 to Chad.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/11">We are pressing both Governments to fulfil their obligations under the Tripoli agreement and for the Government of Sudan to disarm and expel these Chadian groups as soon as possible, which they are required to do under the Darfur peace agreement (DPA).</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/12">In terms of international co-operation, the UK has stated that it is willing to chair a group of donors to look at the restructuring of Sudan's external debt. This is, however, conditional on real progress by the Government of Sudan in resolving the Darfur conflict.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">In November 2005, my predecessor asked DTI officials to look at the impact of relaxing the current restrictions on Sunday shopping hours. At present, large shops over 280 square metres or 3,000 square feet are permitted to open for six continuous hours between 10 am and 6 pm on a Sunday. These shops are not permitted to open on Easter Sunday. The current Sunday trading rules have been in place for many years now and it is important that from time to time we look at whether regulations such as these are still appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/3">As part of the review, the DTI commissioned an independent economic cost benefit analysis from Indepen Consulting Ltd, which is now available on the DTI website. The headline conclusion of the cost benefit analysis is that the net economic benefit of full liberalisation is worth &pound;20.3 billion over 20 years or &pound;1.4 billion per annum. The report also states that the net benefit of allowing large shops to open on Easter Sunday would be &pound;1.03 billion over 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/4">At the same time (January 2006 to April 2006) the department has sought a wide range of views on all aspects of this issue. Consumers, religious groups, employees and businesses of all sizes have all given us their views. We received nearly 1,000 responses to the informal consultation. A summary of these responses has been published on the DTI website today and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. We also held a small business focus group in February and a stakeholder conference in May, which was attended by a wide range of interested parties. Write-ups of both these events are available on the DTI website and in the Libraries of both Houses. In addition, we asked the Office for National Statistics to ask some survey questions on our behalf, and the analysis of this data has also been published today.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/5">We considered all aspects of the impact of changes to Sunday trading. It is clear that there is no substantial demand for change to the present regime. Most respondents believe that the current situation strikes the right balance between all the interests involved. After considering all the evidence received, we have concluded that this is not the right time to make any changes to the Sunday trading laws.</p>
