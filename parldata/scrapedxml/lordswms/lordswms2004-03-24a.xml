<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-03-24a.37.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="37"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040324/text/40324-10.htm#40324-10_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.37.1/1">In our last information and communications technology (ICT) strategy published in 2000 we set ourselves the goal of transforming the FCO from a headquarters with outstations to a single global online organisation. We have come a long way towards achieving that goal. The FCO telecommunications network (FTN) together with our desktop system (Firecrest) provides a dedicated global network that connects our UK offices with over 200 overseas posts and to the rest of Whitehall. On it we send over 1 million e-mails and download gigabytes of data every day, and run a number of applications including Genie (for issuing passports).</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">Following publication of the FCO strategy in December last year, we have reviewed what we need from our ICT to enable the more flexible FCO envisaged in that strategy. <i>E-diplomacy </i>explains how we will introduce greater flexibility to our ICT infrastructure and enable more flexible use of information. This includes more use of mobile and remote-working technology and new applications to make information more accessible, while keeping it secure. We will continue to improve our project management skills and develop closer working partnerships with the private sector to ensure that we provide the most cost-effective service to FCO users. We will also work with other government departments to achieve efficiency savings wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">The plans we have set out in <i>e-diplomacy </i>are challenging but achievable. We believe that they are crucial to the overall effectiveness of the FCO.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/4">Copies of <i>e-diplomacy </i>have been placed in the Library of the House. It is also available on the FCO's web-site <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	Public Audit (Wales) Bill: Clause 54
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-03-24a.37.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100199" speakername="Lord Evans of Temple Guiting" colon=":" colnum="37"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040324/text/40324-10.htm#40324-10_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.37.3/1">Clause 54 was included in the Public Audit (Wales) Bill to ensure consistency in the criminal law across England and Wales. The Government have brought forward an amendment to Clause 54 to make clear the link with the present legislation that currently applies across England and Wales&mdash;Section 49 of the Audit Commission Act 1998. It also ensures that any relaxation of the restrictions in the Audit Commission Act can be applied at the same time in England and Wales, following consultation with the National Assembly for Wales of course.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/2">The Government acknowledge the concerns that have been raised about this clause. Indeed, Section 49 of the Audit Commission Act is already being considered as part of a much wider review of statutory restrictions on disclosure that the Government are undertaking. This is the Department for Constitutional Affairs' review into existing statutory prohibitions on disclosure. Such restrictions can be removed by order under Section 75 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in the case of Acts passed before or in the same Session as that Act. The DCA's <i>Second Report to Parliament on the Review of Legislation Governing the Disclosure of Information </i>published in November 2002 is available at <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/foidoirpt2.htm">http://www.dca.gov.uk/foi/foidoirpt2.htm</a>. Section 49 of the Audit Commission Act is specifically referred to in Part 11 of that report, &quot;Listing by Lead Department&quot;, under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister heading.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.3/3">Following preliminary consideration and consultation, the Government's preferred treatment for Section 49 is to amend it so that it is consistent with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act, which has an overall presumption in favour of disclosure. The Department for Constitutional Affairs currently plans to publish a final report on its review in the autumn. The Department for Constitutional Affairs is also intending to bring forward the first order to be made under the freedom of information legislation later this year, and the Government will include the proposed amendment to Section 49 in that order. When Section 49 is amended, the Government amendment to Clause 54 will allow the relaxation of the restriction on disclosure to apply also in Wales. The Government are therefore following the proper process to address this issue, and are already well advanced in doing this.</p>

	Defence Estate Stewardship Report
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-03-24a.39.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="39"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040324/text/40324-10.htm#40324-10_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.39.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Mnisterial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/2">The 2003 Defence Estate Stewardship Report is published today. This report outlines the continuing progress that the Ministry of Defence is making in implementing the estate strategy that was launched in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/3">The Ministry of Defence is continually examining ways of improving military capability and value for money for the taxpayer. As part of this approach, we want to keep the size and location of our bases under review. Building on initial work that has been done to identify the MoD's core sites, the department is now undertaking further work to examine where estate rationalisation may be possible. This work is consistent with the department's contribution to the Government's independent review of public sector rationalisation&mdash;the Lyons review.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/4">The work now under way is looking at consolidating defence activity at a smaller number of more densely utilised locations in order to achieve the optimum use of land and facilities. This ongoing review will necessarily involve the examination of a number of proposals for the potential collocation and relocation of units. It will also take into account existing relocation studies that have already been announced. It is important to recognise that any options that are considered will need to meet operational requirements as well as representing value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/5">The department is currently at an early stage of this wider review and each proposal that emerges from this work will be subject to full consultation in the normal way. This consultation is essential to determine whether the options under consideration are viable in the widest sense, for instance, in relation to transport, education, health and the future use of potential surplus MoD sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/6">No decisions have yet been reached on any site but as this matter progresses I will ensure that right honourable and honourable Members are advised of progress where such an issue may affect their constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/7">A copy of the report is in the Library of the House.</p>
