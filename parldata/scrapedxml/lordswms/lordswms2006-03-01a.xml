	Inquiries Act 2005
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-03-01a.19.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="19"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60301-44.htm#60301-45_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.19.1/1">I have today published a public consultation paper on the draft rules of procedure to accompany the Inquiries Act 2005. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The consultation is aimed at those people with an interest in and experience of inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/2">The Inquiries Act received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April 2005</phrase> and the provisions were commenced from <phrase class="date" code="">7 June</phrase>. The Act provides a framework for inquiries within the United Kingdom, established by Ministers, into events that have caused or are capable of causing public concern. Section 41 of the Act contains provisions for the making of rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/3">The rules are intended to build upon the best practice of recent inquiries. In particular they set out the procedures for applying for publicly funded legal representation, requiring rates and extent of work to be agreed in advance. This is intended to help the inquiry control costs and avoid disputes over the payment of bills. The rules also assist the chairman in controlling oral proceedings and seek to prevent extensive and costly cross-examination procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/4">Once laid, the rules would apply to all inquiries established by UK Ministers. Devolved administrations have powers to make rules in respect of any inquiries for which they are responsible. Where an inquiry covers issues that cross administrations the commissioning Minister, or Ministers, in respect of joint inquiries, would specify which set of rules was to be applied, or whether a combination of rules was to be adopted.</p>

	Supreme Court
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-03-01a.19.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100203" speakername="Lord Falconer of Thoroton" colon=":" colnum="19"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60301-44.htm#60301-46_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.19.3/1">The location and the setting for the UK Supreme Court should be a reflection of its importance and its place at the apex of the justice system, and the heart of the constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/2">The Supreme Court Implementation Programme has taken a significant step towards delivering a world-class organisation in a location that properly meets the expectations of the public, the Law Lords, the legal profession and court users.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/3">The refurbishment plans for Middlesex Guildhall, the preferred location for the Supreme Court, have been completed and will be formally presented to me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase> for statutory approval. The designs have been developed in close consultation with the Law Lords, in accordance with Section 148 of the Constitutional Reform Act, and meet the statement of requirement that was agreed with Lord Bingham of Cornhill in August 2003. The general opinion of the Law Lords is that the existing plans, very imaginatively, provide reasonable accommodation for the Supreme Court within the confines of the Middlesex Guildhall, although there are some members who remain unconvinced that the building can, even re-designed as proposed, provide a suitable modern setting for the Supreme Court of the UK. We are working within the financial parameters set out in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-14">14 December 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/4">Middlesex Guildhall is a grade II* listed building that requires consent from Westminster City Council before the designs can be finalised. Our aim is to submit an application for planning approval at the end of April.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.3/5">We plan to open the Supreme Court for business in October 2009. This is later than originally envisaged but reflects the time likely to be needed to deliver the current plans and enables us to open the court at the beginning of the legal year.</p>
