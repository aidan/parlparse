	Penalty Notices for Disorder
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-03-15a.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040315/text/40315-21.htm#40315-21_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.1.1/1">Home Office research findings summarising the main findings of the interim evaluation of pilots for penalty notices for disorder, which ran for 12 months from August and September 2002 to 2003, have been published today. The findings show that police officers have welcomed the scheme and are making good use of penalty notices for disorder. In particular the pilots showed that the police find penalty notices for disorder a quick and effective tool for tackling the low-level, drink-related nuisance offending which occurs late at night in city centres. Using a penalty notice for disorder saves police time and there has been a demonstrable switch from cautions and prosecutions in the pilot areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">The issues raised by police officers about repeat offenders, flagging on PNC and taking of fingerprints and DNA have already been addressed. A programme is being developed which will identify repeat offenders on the computer database. A facility now exists to record penalty notices on PNC and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 contains powers for the police to take DNA and fingerprints on arrest for recordable offences. These powers will be introduced on <phrase class="date" code="">5 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">Copies of the research findings have been placed in the Library.</p>

	Doctors and Dentists Remuneration

	<p pid="a.2.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health made the following Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-11">11 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/2">I am responding on behalf of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to the 33rd report of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) which is published today. Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office and the Library. I am grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their hard work.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/3">This year's report deals primarily with general dental practitioners, doctors and dentists in training, non-consultant career grade doctors, medical and dental consultants who have chosen not to take up new contracts, and ophthalmic medical practitioners. For consultants taking up new contracts, general medical practitioners and the salaried primary dental care services, 2004&ndash;05 will be the second year of three-year pay deals agreed as part of NHS pay reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/4">The review body has recommended with effect from April 2004 general increases in remuneration of 2.7 per cent for doctors and dentists in training and non-consultant career grade doctors, 2.5 per cent for consultants who remain on the old contract and an increase of 2.9 per cent in gross fees for general dental practitioners. The review body has also recommended adjustments to some features of the pay scales for associate specialists, staff grade practitioners and specialist registrars and additional funding to support a structured change management programme for dentists and their staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/5">The review body's pay recommendations are being accepted in full and without staging.</p>

	Low Pay Commission
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="a.2.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/2">In July 2003 I asked the independent Low Pay Commission to report on the national minimum wage by the end of February 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/3">The Government are today publishing the commission's 2004 report and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the chair of the commission, Adair Turner, and its other members for their work on this very important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/4">We asked the commission to consider two issues. We asked it to look at possible fine-tuning of the minimum wage rates proposed for October 2004, in the light of the latest economic position; and we asked it, following the recommendation in its fourth report last spring, to look at the possible introduction of a new minimum wage rate for 16 and 17 year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/5">The commission has concluded, first, that the overall economic outlook remains favourable, with growth being slightly higher than forecast last year and the labour market remaining robust with high employment and very low unemployment. In addition, employment across low-paying sectors as a whole is continuing to grow and there seems to be little or no evidence that the minimum wage is having an adverse impact on these sectors. On the basis that the commission believes these recommendations are affordable for business and will not have any significant effect on levels of employment, the Government have accepted the recommended rate increases for 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/6">The commission has also considered whether to introduce a new minimum wage rate for 16 and 17 year-old workers. It has found continued evidence that some jobs in this age group offer very low rates of pay and little or no training, and concluded that it is important to introduce a minimum wage for 16 and 17 year-old workers in order to stop exploitative rates of pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/7">However it is clearly important to set any rate for this group cautiously. Unemployment and employment levels for 16 and 17 year-old workers are substantially worse than those for those aged 18 to 21. The commission believes that a rate of around &pound;3.00 per hour would have negligible impact on young people's decisions on whether to remain in education, and the national implementation of education and maintenance allowances this autumn will encourage young people to stay on in education after they have completed compulsory schooling. The commission has therefore recommended that a rate should be introduced for 16 and 17 year-olds, at &pound;3 in October 2004. The Government have accepted this recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/8">The commission has also considered the position of young apprentices. Many young apprentices earn less than &pound;3 an hour at 16 and 17, and many 18 year-old apprentices earn less than the development rate of &pound;4.10 an hour. We are very concerned to ensure that employers continue to offer apprenticeships and, recognising the need for caution, the commission has recommended extending the current exemption for apprentices aged under 19 to cover 16 and 17 year-old apprentices as well. It has also recommended extending this exemption to cover participants on specified pre-apprenticeship programmes. The Government have accepted this recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/9">I have placed copies of this Statement, the report from the Low Pay Commission and our regulatory impact assessment in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/10" class="italic">Summary of recommendations in the Low Pay Commission's 2004 report and the Government's response</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/11" class="italic">National Minimum Wage Rates </p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/12">The adult rate of the minimum wage should be increased from the present hourly rate of &pound;4.50 to &pound;4.85 in October 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/13">Accept. This increase will take place on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/14">The youth rate (which applies to 18 to 21 year-olds) should be increased from the present hourly rate of &pound;3.80 to &pound;4.10 in October 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/15">Accept. This increase will take place on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/16" class="italic">Young People </p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/17">The Government should introduce a minimum wage for 16 to 17 year-olds, set at an hourly rate of &pound;3 in October 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/18">Accept. We will introduce a new minimum wage rate for 16 to 17 year-olds on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/19">Apprentices aged 16 and 17 and participants on specified pre-apprenticeship programmes should be exempt from the new rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/20">Accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/21"><i>Awareness </i>The Government should consider specific channels to promote awareness of the minimum wage for young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/22">Accept. We will consider this point when developing the publicity campaign to inform people of the new rates this autumn.</p>
