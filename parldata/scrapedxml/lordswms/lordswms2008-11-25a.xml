	<p pid="a.130.1/1">My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Jonathan Shaw) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-03">3 March</phrase>, the Government published the five-year cross-Government Independent Living Strategy. The strategy sets out a series of government commitments aimed at ensuring that disabled people have choice and control over the support they need to live their everyday lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/3">The strategy was produced in partnership with disabled people, and we need to ensure that disabled people are actively involved in making the strategy a reality and checking that good progress is being made. Consequently, the launch of the strategy saw the start of a consultation to seek views on how best to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/4">The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-20">20 June</phrase>, and I am pleased to announce that I am today placing copies of the Government's response to this consultation in both House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/5">Following the consultation, and the further involvement of disabled people in the development of the Government's response, the Government have decided to implement the following steps to make sure disabled people are actively involved in the implementation and monitoring of the strategy:</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/6">establish an Independent Living Scrutiny Group to review progress on implementing the strategy;develop a web-based and print resource to support disabled people's involvement in local strategic partnership boards;work with Equality 2025 to look at how best to use and develop existing networks to form a &quot;network of networks&quot;, creating a two-way channel for communication between the Government and disabled people; examine some of the options, for example, specific courses suggested by respondents for building leadership capacity; andwork to help disabled people's organisations benefit more from new opportunities to build capacity in the third sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/7">The Government's response will be available on the Office for Disability Issues website later today at <a href="http://www.odi.gov.uk/working/independentlivingstrategy.asp">http://www.odi.gov.uk/working/independentlivingstrategy.asp</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.3/1">My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-21">21 November 2008</phrase>, I represented the UK at the Budget Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN).</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/3">Finance Ministers agreed to adopt preliminary draft amending budgets 10 (as amended by the Commission during the course of negotiations) and 11 to the 2008 EC budget. These amend the 2008 budget respectively to reflect latest implementation capacity, thus reducing the level of funding required from member states in 2008, and to mobilise the EU solidarity fund for Cyprus following the recent drought there.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/4">Finance Ministers agreed to adopt amending letters 2 (as amended by the Commission to include budgetary aspects relating to the proposed food facility for developing countries), and 3 to the preliminary draft budget for 2009. These reflected the latest information on agricultural market prices and other developments, and a budgetary transfer to cover the costs of a new reflection group as called for by the October European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/5">During a conciliation meeting between the Council and the European Parliament, agreement was reached on the 2009 EC budget and on the financing for the proposed food facility. The agreement establishes total payment levels of &euro;116.1 billion (0.89 per cent of EU GNI). The European Parliament is scheduled to vote on its own Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-18">18 December</phrase>, after which the 2009 EC budget will be formally adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/6">Five joint statements relating to the budget were also agreed at budget ECOFIN. These concerned the financing of the food facility, the implementation of cohesion policy and EU agencies. The Government are supportive of these statements, which affirm the co-ordination and visibility of Community development assistance and call for sound financial management and budget discipline in the areas that they concern.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Rt. Hon. James Purnell) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) and I have today published the Government's response to Dame Carol Black's review of the health of Britain's working-age population, <I>Working for a H</I><I>ealthier </I><I>T</I><I>omorrow</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/3">Dame Carol's review, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-17">17 March 2008</phrase>, built upon the growing evidence that work is generally good for health and that the mounting costs of ill health are unacceptable, whether for individuals and families, for businesses, or for society as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/4">Her analysis brought into focus, as never before, the scale of the economic cost of ill health and its impact not just on work but on human life. She laid the foundation for a consensus around a new vision for health and work, setting out radical and far- reaching proposals to prevent illness; make early access to work-related health support available to all; and improve the health of the workless so that everyone with the potential to work has the support they need to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/5">Today we are responding in full to Dame Carol's recommendations. Our response <I>Improving H</I><I>ealth and </I><I>Work: Changing L</I><I>ives</I> sets out our proposals. It includes a series of pilots and programmes with the potential to redefine the ambition of health and employment support in Britain, shifting the focus of welfare beyond helping people into work to helping them stay there, and further widening the focus of national healthcare from treatment to prevention and early intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/6">Our proposals include:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/7">changing the paper-based &quot;sick note&quot; to an electronic &quot;fit note&quot;; piloting a &quot;Fit for Work&quot; service;creating a National Centre for Working-Age Health and Well-being;establishing a network of Health, Work and Well-being Co-ordinators;introducing an occupational health helpline; extending NHS Plus; anda review of the health and well-being of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/8">Dame Carol set out a challenging vision for improving the health of the working-age population. Ultimately, responsibility rests with a range of people: government; employers; trade unions; healthcare professionals; and individuals themselves. Today, with the publication of our response, we are setting out the Government's real commitment to this agenda and how we will play our part.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Higher Education and Intellectual Property (David Lammy) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-29">29 October 2008</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills announced that the Government are making extra money available, totalling &pound;100 million in steady state, to meet the higher than expected demand for student support in 2009-10 and beyond. This will enable the Government to maintain their intention that two-thirds of eligible students should receive either the full grant of &pound;2,906 or a partial grant in 2009-10. We also expect that our commitment for one-third of eligible students to receive a full grant will be exceeded&mdash;under the new package, we anticipate that 40 per cent of students may be eligible for a full grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/3">This means that students with household incomes ranging from &pound;18,360 to &pound;50,020 will be eligible for higher levels of grant than in 2007-08, while those with incomes ranging from &pound;18,360 to &pound;57,708 will be eligible for a more generous package of grant and loan support than in 2007-08. Amendment regulations to the Education (Student Support) (No. 2) Regulations 2008 are being laid today.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/4">My predecessor as Minister of State for Higher Education, Bill Rammell, placed a memorandum in the Library on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-13">13 May 2008</phrase> giving details of the increased loan, grant and fee rates for the 2009-10 academic year, in line with forecast price increases. The detailed tables in that memorandum gave income thresholds for the partial maintenance grant and for the non-means-tested element of the student loan, which have now been revised. I am therefore placing an updated memorandum in the Library which makes clear the levels of support available to new entrants in 2009-10, as well as giving tables showing support for continuing students.</p>

	Iraq: Coalition Regional Commands

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-11-25a.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100844" speakername="Baroness Taylor of Bolton" colon=":" colnum="138"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81125-wms0009.htm#81125-wms0009.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.138.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (John Hutton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">I should like to make a Statement on the restructuring of coalition regional commands in Iraq and the implications for the ongoing UK mission there.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3">As the Iraqi security forces have grown and matured, coalition forces across Iraq have been able to move increasingly into overwatch and mentoring operations. These successes have allowed coalition forces and structures to be rationalised and combat forces from several nations have been able to return home. The UK has also been able to reduce the scale of its deployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/4">Until recently, the area south of Baghdad was divided into three multinational divisional areas, with MND-Centre under US control, MND-Centre South under Polish control and MND-South East under UK control. In future, it is anticipated that only a single multinational divisional headquarters will be required south of Baghdad, given that the Iraqi security forces now have the lead in providing the security for all nine provinces in this area. As part of this restructuring, MND-Centre merged with MND-Centre South as Polish forces completed their mission and MND-Centre has now also taken over overwatch from MND-South East of the three provinces Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan. This new US divisional area is called MND-Centre. Security in these three provinces is provided by the 10th Division of the Iraqi Army (previously trained by UK and Australian forces) and therefore this boundary move does not affect any UK forces, which are focused in Basra. This restructuring of divisional areas is therefore an adjustment to reflect better both the dispositions of coalition and Iraqi forces on the ground and the continuing improvements in security. This new divisional area will remain MND-Centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/5">MND-South East, which now consists solely of Basra province, remains focused on developing the rapidly improving 14th Division. The delivery of 14th Division was defined by the Prime Minister in his <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July</phrase> statement as one of the decisive conditions for transition and it is therefore right that this is where UK forces concentrate their efforts. As the Iraqi security forces increasingly take responsibility for providing security, the role and shape of the coalition will naturally evolve as efforts increasingly focus on economic development, reconstruction and capacity building.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (John Hutton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/2">I attended an informal meeting of NATO Defence Ministers in Budapest, Hungary on 9-<phrase class="date" code="2008-10-10">10 October 2008</phrase>. It provided an important opportunity for discussions on operations and on the transformation of NATO capabilities, following the informal Defence Ministers' meeting in London on 18-<phrase class="date" code="2008-09-19">19 September 2008</phrase>, which was attended by my predecessor as Secretary of State for Defence, the right honourable Des Browne.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/3">The main focus of the meeting in London was the continuing transformation of the Alliance. Ministers expressed their strong support for NATO transformation and for proposals made during the meeting to increase the targets for Allies' deployable capabilities. Over dinner, Ministers reflected on the implications for NATO of the events in Georgia in the preceding months. There was consensus that collective defence and discretionary, out-of-area operations required the same expeditionary capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/4">The focus of the meeting in Budapest was on current operations. This was the first ministerial meeting in which Albania and Croatia participated fully. Ministers underlined the importance of the NATO operation in Afghanistan, and in response to a request from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, directed ISAF to take action, with the Afghan authorities, against narcotics facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency within priority regions. Ministers stated their continued support for NATO's KFOR mission and its work in providing a safe and secure environment in Kosovo. On Afghanistan, NATO Ministers also had a meeting with their counterparts from non-NATO nations making valuable contributions to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, together with the Defence Minister of Afghanistan, the United Nations Secretary-General's special representative for Afghanistan and a European Union senior representative.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/2">The Office for Strategic Co-ordination of Health Research (OSCHR) was established 22 months ago following Sir David Cooksey's recommendations for better co-ordination of health research activities across the UK, and a stronger focus on translating basic science into improved care for NHS patients. Sir David's report <I>A Review of UK Health Research Funding</I> was published in December 2006. The first progress report from the chairman of OSCHR, Professor Sir John Bell, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-18">18 November 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/3">Sir John's report <I>Office for Strategic Coordination of Health: Chairman's First Progress Report</I> highlights the main elements of the combined approach that has been put in place by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) since the Cooksey review. This period has seen an unprecedented commitment to health research in terms of funding, infrastructure, research programmes and the volume of health research commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/4">The Government's single health research fund, which will soon top &pound;1.7 billion a year, is allocated by the Department of Health to the National Institute for Health Research in England, and by the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills to the Medical Research Council, which supports research throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/5">The progress report also announces that the Prime Minister has asked for a set of national ambitions for health research to be developed to build on the progress so far and encourage the translation of major research breakthroughs into new NHS treatments and services. The national ambitions will be developed independently of government by the research funding bodies, under the auspices of OSCHR, in consultation with the academic community.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/6">A copy of the report has been placed in the Library.</p>

This document marks the latest milestone in our longer-term planning process, setting out our goals and identifying the various challenges that future transport schemes will need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/3">The publication of <I>Towards a Sustainable Transport System</I> in October 2007 outlined our approach to long-term transport planning. Since then, the department has been undertaking further work and accelerating the process for identifying the strategic national corridors where we face our most immediate transport challenges. The national networks strategy group I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-29">29 October</phrase> will be focusing on measures to ensure that we make best use of investment in key strategic national corridors and develop these for the longer term. The development of solutions for international networks will also be led by the department. Regions and local authorities will undertake similar work for the remaining networks.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.1/6">I am also announcing today that I am bringing forward over &pound;1 billion of investment in improving our nation's transport infrastructure, in particular to tackle bottlenecks and improve access to key international gateways. This comprises an extra &pound;700 million which will be invested in major transport projects next year to accelerate government plans to cut congestion and significantly increase rail capacity. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/7">dualling of the A46 between Newark and Widmerpool (&pound;100 million&mdash;as part of &pound;174 million government funding overall);</p>

	<p pid="a.147.1/9">and introducing more managed motorways schemes to make best use of our existing motorway capacity (&pound;300 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/10">Alongside that, &pound;300 million of new government funding will be committed to speeding up the delivery of other key schemes that improve transport links to some of the UK's most important airports and ports, as well as offering more environmentally friendly options for transporting freight. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/11">improvements to the A180/A160 junction to enhance access to Immingham Port (&pound;30 million);</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/12">technology improvements to enhance traffic flow on the A12 between the M25 and Ipswich, improving access to Felixstowe and Harwich ports (&pound;60 million);</p>

	<p pid="a.149.1/1">My right honourable friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/2">The Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday announced as part of the Pre-Budget Report a temporary reduction in the standard rate of VAT to 15 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-01">1 December 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> when the rate will return to 17.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/3">The Government have taken these steps to provide further support for growth and incomes during the economic downturn. The Government's discretionary fiscal action will deliver support of around 1 per cent of GDP to the economy in total in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/4">However, it is also important that the Government protect the public finances from artificial avoidance seeking to exploit the change in VAT rates where there is no current economic activity. Therefore, the Finance Bill 2009 will contain anti-forestalling legislation to ensure that the announced VAT rate changes are fully effective. The Government will expose the draft legislation for comment as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/5">Anti-forestalling legislation will apply from today to ensure that, in the circumstances set out below, supplies with a basic time of supply after a VAT rate increase takes effect will be subject to the rate of VAT in force at that time. The provisions are designed to prevent artificial forestalling while being straightforward for business to understand and operate and not affecting genuine commercial transactions. This legislation is not intended to catch the normal commercial activity of providing goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/6">The anti-forestalling legislation will apply in the circumstances set out below where the supplier receives a prepayment for the goods or services or issues a VAT invoice in advance of the rate increase. It will also apply where, in advance of the rate increase, the supplier grants the customer an option or a right to obtain goods or services at a discount or free of charge after the rate increase takes effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/7">The circumstances are that the customer cannot recover VAT in full on the supply and that:</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/8">the supplier and customer are connected parties;</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/9">the supplier receives a prepayment, or grants the customer an option or a right, and the prepayment, or the acquisition of the option or right, is wholly or partly funded (directly or indirectly) by the supplier;</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/10">or a VAT invoice is issued by the supplier showing an amount any part of which is due more than six months after the date of the invoice.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/11">The basic time of supply is normally when goods are delivered or made available, or when services are performed. For continuous supplies of goods or services, with consideration payable periodically or from time to time, the basic time of supply will be the end of the period to which a payment or invoice relates (e.g. a billing period).</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/12">Although the anti-forestalling legislation will apply from today, any extra VAT arising from its operation will not become due until after Royal Assent of the Finance Bill 2009. Until then, suppliers should continue to account for VAT as normal, applying the VAT rate at the time of the prepayment, VAT invoice issue or grant of the right or option.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/13">The operation of the legislation will be kept under review to ensure that the provisions work as intended. Any additional or alternative anti-forestalling provisions included in the Finance Bill 2009 will only take effect at the earliest from the date that they are announced.</p>
