	<p pid="a.153.1/1">My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Kenneth Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/2">I am pleased to announce the appointment of the right honourable Dame Janet Smith DBE as the new independent assessor of miscarriages of justice compensation under Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The assessor is appointed under Schedule 12 to the Criminal Justice Act 1988.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/3">The assessor's role is to assess the amount of compensation to be paid under Section 133 once Ministers have decided that the eligibility criteria are met. Neither Ministers nor civil servants play any role in the assessment of compensation and I am required by Section 133(4) to accept the award made by the assessor. The assessor plays no role in deciding whether an applicant is eligible under Section 133.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/4">Dame Janet, who retired as an appeal court judge in May, replaces Lord Brennan of Bibury QC who has held the position since <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-27">27 July 2001</phrase> and whose term of office comes to an end on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-26">26 July 2011</phrase>. Lord Brennan indicated that he did not wish to be appointed for a further term. Dame Janet will take up her appointment on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-01">1 July</phrase>, which will initially be for two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/5">The assessor is an office holder rather than a public appointment so the appointment rules of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) are not required to be followed. However, the previous assessor was appointed following an open recruitment campaign using OCPA guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/6">However, in considering who should be appointed to the role I consulted the Lord Chief Justice and he recommended Dame Janet. I was delighted to accept his recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/7">Dame Janet is eminently qualified for the role. She has extensive experience of the assessment of damages in personal injury litigation. As a former Lady Justice of Appeal she will continue the robust independence which her predecessors have brought to the role. As well as my full confidence she will have the confidence of applicants and their representatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/8">Finally, I am extremely grateful to Lord Brennan for the very high level of service he has provided over the past 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Liam Fox) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/2">As part of his Statement on the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-19">19 October 2010</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said that we had reviewed our deterrence requirements and concluded that we could meet the requirement for an effective and credible deterrent with a smaller number of nuclear weapons, and over the next few years would reduce the scale of the current deployed capability, incorporating this reduction into plans for the successor submarine. Therefore, we would reduce the number of warheads on board each submarine from a maximum of 48 to a maximum of 40, reduce the number of operational missiles in the Vanguard class submarines to no more than eight, and reduce the number of operational warheads from fewer than 160 to no more than 120.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/3">I wish to inform the House that the programme for implementing the SDSR warhead reductions has commenced: at least one of the Vanguard class ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) now carries a maximum of 40 nuclear warheads. The programme of work to complete these changes across the Vanguard SSBN fleet will be completed within the constraints of the deterrent's operational programme. We currently expect completion to be made within this Parliament. The Government do not comment upon the operational programme and therefore updates on this implementation programme will not be given. I will update the House further once the changes have been completed across the current SSBN fleet and the SDSR commitment to reducing our stock of operationally deployed warheads has been fulfilled. On current plans our expectation is that the subsequent reduction in our total stockpile to no more than 180 warheads will be completed by the mid 2020s.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/4">The early commencement of the programme for these reductions in warheads is a significant step and further demonstrates the Government's commitment to fulfilling the UK's disarmament obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Government remain committed to maintaining the minimum credible deterrent necessary to achieve our deterrence objectives of guaranteeing national security.</p>
