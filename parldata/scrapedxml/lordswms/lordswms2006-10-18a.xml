<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-10-18a.81.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="81"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61018-wms0001.htm#06101842000007">
	<p pid="a.81.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Margaret Beckett) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/2">The informal summit of European Union heads of state and government will be held on <phrase class="date" code="">20 October</phrase> in Lahti, Finland. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister will represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/3">The Government welcome the opportunity the Lahti summit provides for EU leaders to take forward the &quot;delivery agenda&quot; agreed at the Hampton Court summit last October, during the United Kingdom's presidency of the EU. This will help the EU respond to the challenges of the 21st century: improving European innovation and research; ensuring Europe's universities can compete globally; tackling the energy challenges all member states face; addressing citizens' concerns on security and on migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/4">In particular, Lahti will concentrate on EU external energy policy and innovation. There will also be discussion of immigration and of Darfur, as well as diner with President Putin.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/5">At Lahti, we will underline the importance of climate security in the EU's discussion of energy; for example, through the extension of the emissions trading scheme and developing clean coal technology. Delivering our climate change goals is bound up with improving our competitiveness and fostering jobs, growth and innovation. Lahti will be an opportunity to set a clear political framework for future work.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/6">The discussion of external energy issues will also ensure we maintain the momentum of the Hampton Court agenda, for example by mainstreaming energy into the EU's relations with third countries. Energy will also feature in the discussions with President Putin over dinner. This will also be an opportunity to consider the future of the strategic relationship between Russia and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/7">The other main theme at Lahti will be innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/8">The Government believe there are two major challenges for the EU in this area. First, a fragmentation of effort in research; and, secondly, Europe's relative weakness in getting to market the high quality research and innovation carried out by its research base and universities. Lahti should make progress on the key aspects of improving the EU's innovation performance, such as intellectual property rights and the links between business and education.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/9">Heads of government will also discuss the situation in Darfur, at the request of the Prime Minister. It is important that EU heads send a clear message underlining the urgent need to implement the peace deal agreed in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/10">We also expect a discussion of migration issues, bearing in mind recent experience in Spain. Member states agreed at Hampton Court to a series of commitments as part of the global approach to migration. It is important that the EU continues to prioritise delivery of those actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/11">The Government will provide a Written Statement to the House next week on the outcome of the Lahti summit.</p>
