	Afghanistan: Counter-narcotics
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-02-14b.59.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060214/text/60214-18.htm#60214-18_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.59.1/1">In his opening remarks to the London Conference on Afghanistan held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February</phrase>, his Excellency Hamid Karzai, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, described narcotics and terrorism as the two gravest threats facing Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/2">Despite a 21 per cent reduction in opium poppy cultivation in 2005 (130,000 hectares in 2003&ndash;04 to 104,000 hectares in 2004&ndash;05), the trade in Afghan drugs remains a significant challenge to Afghanistan's long-term security, development and effective governance. It undermines the stability of the region and accounts for almost 90 per cent of the world supply of opiates.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/3">President Karzai has taken a strong lead in the struggle against the pervasive and corrosive threat posed by the cultivation, production and trafficking of narcotics. His Government have, with the support of the UK as the key partner nation for counter-narcotics, recently reviewed and updated their National Drug Control Strategy to ensure their policy approach is the right one. The strategy was endorsed by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Counter-narcotics and approved by President Karzai in January. The international community also expressed its strong collective support for the updated strategy following its presentation by the Afghan Minister for Counter-narcotics, Engineer Habibullah Qaderi, during the counter-narcotics session of the London conference.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/4">The National Drug Control Strategy represents a balanced and comprehensive approach to the drug problem. It sets out four key priorities, which I believe will help make a greater impact on the trade and sustain the reduction in cultivation we have seen in 2005. These are:</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/5" class="indent">disrupting the drugs trade by targeting traffickers and their backers;</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/6" class="indent">strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods;</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/7" class="indent">reducing the demand for illicit drugs and treatment of problem drug users; and</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/8" class="indent">developing state institutions at the central and provincial level.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/9">The strategy also notes that,</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/10" class="indent">&quot;where there are legal livelihoods, a credible threat of eradication is needed in order to incentivise the shift away from poppy cultivation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/11">It also highlights the importance of raising public awareness and improving international and regional co-operation on counter-narcotics.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/12">In recognition of the serious threat that narcotics pose to the broader reconstruction effort in Afghanistan and the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach equal to the scale of the challenge, counter-narcotics is also included as a cross-cutting theme in the Afghanistan compact between the Afghan Government and the international community, which was also launched at the London conference. The compact includes high-level benchmarks to measure progress in the counter-narcotics effort. These benchmarks are underpinned by the more detailed planning in the National Drug Control Strategy and the interim Afghan National Development Strategy, the third of the interlocking documents launched in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/13">The challenge now is implementation. In support of the Government of Afghanistan's efforts, the UK will spend &pound;270 million over this and the next two financial years, including some &pound;130 million on legal rural livelihoods and institutional development from the Department for International Development. In the current financial year, about 70 per cent of the rest of UK spending has been channelled into efforts to target traffickers and disrupt the trade. We expect this to remain a top priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/14">As part of the activity to date, the UK has helped to establish and provide training for the Counter-narcotics Police of Afghanistan&mdash;the lead drug law enforcement agency, headquartered in Kabul, with seven provincial offices. The UK is also providing training for the Afghan Special Narcotics Force, an elite and highly trained force equipped to tackle high-value targets across the country. We are also working with the international community to recruit and train a counter-narcotics criminal justice task force of Afghan investigators, prosecutors and judges to work with the counter-narcotics police, to be able to push through successful drugs investigations and prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/15">The UK has funded the development of five drug treatment centres and is working with the Ministry of Counter-narcotics to determine how best to support activity in this area following the completion of UNODC's survey on drug use within Afghanistan late last year. We are also supporting the US-led Poppy Elimination Programme (PEP) by funding the salaries of Afghan staff charged with raising awareness of the illegality of the opium industry and monitoring governor-led eradication in priority poppy growing provinces.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/16">From the spring, as my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Dr John Reid) announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-26">26 January</phrase>, UK troops will be deployed to the south of Afghanistan, to Helmand province, in support of the UN-authorised, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. They will work to counter insurgency and help the appropriate authorities build security and government institutions to continue the progress of recent years. Above all, their presence will help the Afghans create the environment in which economic development and institutional reform&mdash;both essential to the elimination of the opium industry&mdash;can take place. ISAF forces will be able to help with the provision of training to Afghan counter-narcotics forces and will, when necessary, provide support to their operations. They will also help the Afghan Government explain their policies to the Afghan people. ISAF forces will not take part in the eradication of opium poppy or in pre-planned and direct military action against the drugs trade. As President Karzai has pointed out, this is a job for the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/17">The UK is working hard to increase international support, including NATO and coalition support, for the counter-narcotics campaign. It was heartening to note the collective recognition at the London conference of the need to increase resources to help the Government of Afghanistan deliver against the ambitious, but essential, benchmarks they have set themselves. Several delegations, including the US ($2 million), Sweden ($2 million), Korea and the UK (at least &pound;30 million, or $52.9 million), announced contributions to the Counter-narcotics Trust Fund set up to support the strategy in London. These contributions add to those already committed by Australia, New Zealand, the EC and Estonia ($1.5 million, $338,000, $18.4 million and $50,000 respectively), giving a total of $77 million pledged to the CN trust fund. The fund will bring counter-narcotics funding on budget; give the Afghans greater ownership over this important agenda; and ensure that assistance is targeted as effectively as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/18">The commitment of the Government of Afghanistan and the support of the international community are starting to yield results. Progress is being made. 2005 saw the establishment of a Ministry for Counter-narcotics in Afghanistan, the passage of vital counter-narcotics legislation, the conviction of over 90 drug traffickers and the seizure of some 165 tonnes of opiates. The Counter-narcotics Police of Afghanistan is now 500 strong and the operations of the Afghan Special Narcotics Force are starting to make an impact on the trade, forcing traffickers to shift their <i>modus operandi</i>, moving and storing drugs in smaller quantities.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/19">In parallel, the National Rural Access Programme has restored thousands of kilometres of roads and renovated hundreds of irrigation systems through labour-intensive cash-for-work schemes aimed at providing basic employment opportunities for the rural poor. Work is also taking place to improve social protection for the poor (through the creation of social safety nets); to improve access to finance and credit; and to develop better provincial development planning processes and research programmes into new crops and markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/20">It will not be easy to sustain last year's reduction in cultivation. Sustainable drug elimination strategies take time. Afghanistan will continue to require the strong support of the international community and the firm commitment of its own Government. As the key partner nation for counter-narcotics the UK remains committed to the challenge and to supporting the delivery of the National Drug Control Strategy. We believe this represents the best means of securing a sustainable reduction in the cultivation and trafficking in opium.</p>

	Armed Forces: MARS Programme
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-02-14b.62.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="62"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060214/text/60214-19.htm#60214-19_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.62.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/2">I am pleased to announce that the following three companies have been chosen to compete for the role of integrator for the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) programme:</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/3" class="indent">AMEC</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/4" class="indent">KBR</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/5" class="indent">Raytheon Systems Ltd</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/6">MARS will form an essential part of the UK's versatile maritime force, providing a suite of vessels to supply UK and allied vessels with fuel, food, ordnance and other support they need to sustain operations. MARS will also introduce a new capability, providing joint sea-based logistics for those operations where host-nation support is absent or limited or where we would wish to reduce our footprint ashore.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/7">The MARS vessels will have some military features while being technically similar to specialist merchant ships. We therefore want the build of the MARS ships to harness the efficiency of specialist commercial shipbuilding practice. As indicated in the <i>Defence Industrial Strategy</i>, we expect the competition for the shipbuilding element of this project to be wide-ranging. UK yards and other suppliers will be given every opportunity to compete for this shipbuilding work and should see it as both a challenge and an opportunity to demonstrate world-class performance. With the high planned workload on CVF and Type 45, the complex warship design and integration capabilities that we intend to sustain in the UK will remain healthy for some years.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/8">The integrator's key role will be to use its expertise in engineering project management and supply-chain relationships to drive good project management and partnering practice into a delivery team consisting of the MoD, the integrator, and key suppliers. The selected integrator will also help the MoD identify the shipbuilders and other key suppliers, and develop the right partnering approach to ensure successful delivery of the MARS programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/9">The shortlisting of potential integrators marks a significant step forward for this project. The companies will now work with the Ministry of Defence to provide evidence of their suitability to be the MARS integrator.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/10">The MARS project, along with the future aircraft carriers, Type 45 destroyers and Astute submarines, forms part of the largest procurement programme of new ships for many years, reinforcing our firm commitment to provide UK Armed Forces with the enhanced naval capabilities needed to face the threats of the 21st century.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.1/36">The Department of Health DEL has increased by &pound;112,322,000 to reflect take-up of &pound;200,000,000 capital end-year flexibility as announced in the public expenditure White Paper (Cm 6639) of July 2005, and &pound;1,461,000 from the &quot;invest to save&quot; budget for social care projects. In addition, transfers have been agreed with the DHSS Northern Ireland of &pound;554,000 for out-of-area treatments and from the Cabinet Office of &pound;484,000 (administration costs) for services of the parliamentary counsel. These increases are offset by transfers to the Department for Education and Skills of &pound;18,854,000 mainly for capital building programmes and pension costs; a transfer to the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs of &pound;60,000,000 for a contribution towards the over-30 months scheme; to the Department for Constitutional Affairs of &pound;1,500,000 capital associated with the transfer of the mental health review tribunals; to the Scottish Executive of &pound;4,140,000 for out-of-area treatments; to the National Assembly for Wales of &pound;5,684,000 mainly for out-of-area treatments and cross-border flows.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.1/38">The changes to the Food Standards Agency resource element of the departmental expenditure limit arises from an increase in MHS gross cost of &pound;5,000,000 offset by a similar increase in the income limit. Due to this neutral change the programme DEL has been increased by &pound;1,000 to ensure there is a token supplementary amount to be voted.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/39">The changes to the Food Standards Agency capital element of the departmental expenditure limit arises from increased capital expenditure of &pound;950,000 for the renewal of IT infrastructure and strengthening IT contingency arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.84.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Alistair Darling) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.3/2">With construction of the link nearing completion, my department has been considering its future relationship with the project and with London and Continental Railways, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the rail link. A number of options have been considered, touching on future financial arrangements, the current structure of controls in light of current best practice in such projects and the structure of LCR and its subsidiary companies. Officials have for some time held discussions with LCR about the best long-term commercial structure. Separately, my department has recently been approached by a third party, asking about the department's attitude to its discussing with LCR's shareholders the potential acquisition of its current holdings, and about the issues of finance, structure and control mentioned above. My department has made it clear that any changes to LCR's ownership, corporate structure or controls structure will be considered against the primary objective of ensuring continuing value for taxpayers' money.</p>

	Royal Navy: Surface Warship Maintenance and Repair
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-02-14b.85.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="85"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060214/text/60214-25.htm#60214-25_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.85.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Dr John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/2">I am pleased to announce new, alternative contracting arrangements for surface warship maintenance and repair. These arrangements were signalled as part of the wider <i>Defence Industrial Strategy</i> and today's announcement is an important step towards ensuring that the capability requirements of the Royal Navy can be met now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/3">Surface warship upkeep (generally known as refitting) contracts have increasingly been awarded following competition while operational (or fleet) time support is delivered through partnering arrangements under the Warship Support Modernisation Initiative. While these arrangements have delivered clear, value-for-money benefits to the MoD, recent force level reductions coupled with overcapacity in the surface ship repair market prompted a review. The department, in consultation with industry, undertook a study (the Surface Ship Support Study) to identify the optimum approach for the future maintenance and repair of surface warships (aircraft carriers, major amphibious vessels, destroyers, frigates and mine warfare vessels) that would deliver the most efficient, effective and sustainable support policy and offer best value for money to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/4">The study has concluded that the option best able to meet the needs of both the department and industry would be the formation of a surface warship support alliance, which would include current providers of surface warship upkeep and fleet time support. We will now enter into detailed dialogue with industry to investigate the feasibility of delivering such support through an alliance. During this exploratory phase, which is planned to last up to two years, competition policy will be suspended, to enable the alliance concept to be developed and tested progressively in a controlled manner. The first package of surface warship upkeep to be included in the exploratory phase will be that for HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot;, HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot;, HMS &quot;Chiddingfold&quot; and HMS &quot;Penzance&quot;. It is currently planned to commence in autumn 2006. At the end of the exploratory phase there will be a review of the alliancing approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/5">These new arrangements will promote a sustainable industrial base that retains key operational support and system upgrade capabilities within the UK, so are vital to our ability to maintain and support the Royal Navy. We will be working closely with industry in a spirit of transparency and trust to ensure more effective joint planning for the longer term. The aim will be to improve the delivery of surface ship support, with benefits for the Royal Navy, industry and the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.1/15">The net change in the resource element of the DEL arises from the Machinery of Government change transferring the Government Social Research Unit from Cabinet Office to HM Treasury, &pound;914,000 for 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/16">The following items are DEL-neutral:</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/17">The drawdown of &pound;600,000 administration costs from the Financial Inclusion Fund for expenditure on the promotion of banking services to those on low incomes. &pound;1 million of funding for the FIF was classified as Treasury non-voted DEL administration budget at the start of the year; the other &pound;400,000 remains within non-voted DEL.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/18">Transfer between RfRs 1 and 3, &pound;12,465,000, to fund OGC's work on its wider remit, including delivering the efficiency programme and changes in provisions relating to the residual vacant estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/19">Transfer between RfRs 1 and 2, &pound;3,700,000, for increased spend on coinage arising from higher metal prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/20">Increase in appropriations-in-aid within all three RfRs (RfR1 &pound;10,702,000, RfR2 &pound;500,000, RfR3 &pound;325,000) with increased expenditure switching from RfR1 to RfR2 for coinage spend, see above, and RfR3 for expenditure relating to OGC's fee-earning services.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/21">Movement of OGC Efficiency Challenge Fund allocation from non-voted to voted, &pound;2,422,000. The allocation for the ECF within non-voted DEL for 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;7,800,000, and total forecast ECF expenditure for 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;8,868,000. The other &pound;6,446,000 of funding is being transferred from RfR1, as above.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/22">The net reduction of &pound;1,745,000 in the capital element of the DEL arises from:</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/23">Transfer of capital spend from core Treasury (RfR1) to fund planned expenditure by OGC (RfR3). The transfer is DEL-neutral. In addition, non-operating appropriations in aid are increased by &pound;1,380,000 to cover loan repayments from OGC buying solutions to OGC. The increased net provision is to finance OGC's spend on its domestic IT systems and capital improvements to its Norwich office.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/24">A further reduction in core Treasury and DMO capital for provision in the main estimate is no longer required.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/25">The non-voted resource DEL of &pound;35.4 million in the table above includes banking and gilts registration services provided by the Bank of England and Computershare, plus MEPs' salaries and the Civil List. Latest forecasts indicate that those activities are likely to underspend the provision by around &pound;3.9 million in aggregate. In addition, &pound;400,000 of the original &pound;1 million provision for the Financial Inclusion Fund and &pound;5,378,000 of the original &pound;7.8 million provision for the Efficiency Challenge Fund has not been transferred to voted resource DEL and will not be applied in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
