	European Union Bill
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-10-06a.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100308" speakername="Lord Howell of Guildford" colon=":" colnum="5"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101006-wms0001.htm#10100614000003">
	<p pid="a.5.1/1">The coalition programme for government said that the Government would examine the case for a United Kingdom sovereignty Bill affirming that ultimate authority remains with Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/2">The common law is already clear on this. Parliament is sovereign. EU law has effect in the UK because-and solely because-Parliament wills that it should. Parliament chose to pass the European Communities Act 1972. That was the act of a sovereign Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/3">The Government have explored how to ensure that this fundamental principle of Parliamentary sovereignty is upheld in relation to EU law. We have assessed whether the common law provides sufficient ongoing and unassailable protection for that principle. Our assessment is that to date, case law has upheld that principle. But we have decided to put the matter beyond speculation by placing this principle on a statutory footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/4">In the autumn, the Government will legislate to underline that what a sovereign Parliament can do, a sovereign Parliament can always undo. A clause to this effect will be included in the European Union Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/5">This clause will not alter the existing UK legal order on a day-to-day basis in relation to EU law. And it will be in line with the practice of other member states, like Germany. Although they have a different constitutional framework, they have given effect to EU law through a sovereign act.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Tourism and Heritage (John Penrose) made the following Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-15">15 September</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-09-15.39"><I>Official Report</I>,Commons, col. 39WS</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/2">The Government announced in the Budget on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June</phrase> that they would over the next 12 months resolve the future of the Tote in a way that secures value for the taxpayer and which recognises the support the Tote currently provides to the racing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/3">In line with that objective, the Government are now preparing to launch an open market process in the late autumn in which it will invite proposals from interested parties. This process will be open to all organisations which have an interest in the Tote, and the Government expect to be in a position to update the House early in the New Year.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/4">The Government will continue to liaise closely with the Board of the Tote and with racing interests as this process unfolds.</p>
