	<p pid="a.130.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/2">The supplement to the 2006 report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body, making recommendations on the pay of service medical and dental officers, has been published today. Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I wish to express my thanks to the chairman and members of the review body for their report.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/3">The review body recommended a pay increase of 2.2 per cent for junior doctors and cadets, and 2.4 per cent for associate specialists. In addition, the review body recommended that there should be an increase of 2.2 per cent in the values of trainer pay and distinction and clinical excellence awards. These recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/4">All regular and reserve defence medical services consultants, general medical practitioners, general dental practitioners and higher medical management personnel will also receive a 2.2 per cent increase effective from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. In addition, and closely matching the recommendation of the AFPRB, the Government have agreed to a further consolidated payment effective from <phrase class="date" code="">1 November 2006</phrase> to ensure that the levels of pay are comparable to their counterparts in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/5">The agreed pay award will be met from within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-07-24a.131.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="131"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60724-wms0175.htm#06072430000057">
	<p pid="a.131.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/2">I have made clear my determination to ensure that the Armed Forces on operations have the resources that they need to do the job. I said that I would update the House on developments in two particular areas of operational capability: additional options for armoured vehicles and helicopter support for Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/3">As I told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-26">26 June</phrase>, I ordered an urgent review of our armoured vehicle fleet, particularly focused on the evolving threat in Iraq, but covering the whole operational picture, including Afghanistan, to ensure that we were providing commanders with the best options.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/4">That review has now concluded. It has confirmed that there is a growing requirement for a protected vehicle with capabilities between our heavy armour, such as Warrior, and lighter patrol vehicles, such as Snatch. The review has also identified feasible options to address the gap in the short term. We have now completed a very rapid assessment of those options and have identified three complementary ways forward. Two of these build on and accelerate work that is already ongoing in the department. The third is new. The necessary funding will come in part from acceleration of existing funding within the defence budget and in part from substantial new funding from the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/5">The first element is an additional buy of around 100 Vector, our new Pinzgauer-based protected patrol vehicle, for Afghanistan, on top of the 62 already on contract. Vector provides good protection and, importantly, increased mobility and capacity compared with Snatch, which makes it very suitable for the rugged terrain and long patrol distances in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/6">The second element is to provide around 70 additional up-armoured and upgraded FV430 to equip a mechanised infantry battlegroup for Iraq by the spring of 2007, again on top of the 54 that we have already ordered. The FV430 will be delivered incrementally, with the first vehicles currently expected to be delivered this autumn. Significantly smaller and lighter than Warrior, the up-armoured FV430 will provide a similar level of protection while being less intimidating and having less impact on local infrastructure, thereby providing commanders with an important additional option. Since it is able to carry out many of the same tasks as Warrior, it will also relieve pressure on heavily committed Warrior vehicles and armoured infantry battlegroups.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/7">The third, new element is the Cougar, manufactured by Force Protection Incorporated of Charleston, South Carolina. We judge that this vehicle meets our requirement for a well protected, wheeled patrol vehicle with a less intimidating profile than tracked vehicles such as Warrior or FV430. We are arranging to rapidly procure around 100 vehicles through US military sources. We have received excellent co-operation from the US Government, military and industry&mdash;an example of the special relationship bringing real benefits for our soldiers on the ground. Once we take possession of the vehicles, we must then customise them with Bowman radios and electronic countermeasures, and then fit additional armour beyond the standard level, to ensure that they have the best possible protection. This procurement and enhancement process takes time. But we expect to be able to deliver the vehicles, in batches, with an effective capability in place before the end of the year and continuing through the next six-month rotations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/8">These three vehicles will complement existing Warrior and Snatch. Warrior will continue to provide the capability to deal with the most demanding threats, but its profile and weight make is unsuitable for some operations and situations, such as Afghanistan. Snatch, with a much less intimidating profile, enables troops to interact with locals and promotes a sense of normality, and it will remain a key tool for building and maintaining consent. The up-armoured FV430, the Cougar medium PPV and Vector fill the requirements for varying degrees of protection, mobility and profile between these two extremes. But I am confident that together these vehicles provide commanders with the right range of options to deal with the situations and threats that they face.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/9">In my Afghanistan Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-10">10 July 2006</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 1131-35), I detailed the additional forces that we shall deploy to southern Afghanistan. I also undertook to provide further details of the enhancement of the support helicopter force deployed as part of the Helmand task force once I had received definitive advice on the needs of our commanders on the ground. I have now had that advice, as endorsed by the Chief of the Defence Staff, and I have directed that those needs be met in full. I have therefore directed that two extra CH-47 Chinook be deployed, the first in early September 2006 and the second in October. Helicopter force levels will remain under constant review.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/10">I also wish to update the House on the units assigned to provide additional forces for Afghanistan. Force protection for 28 Regiment, Royal Engineers will be provided by W Company, 45 Commando, Royal Marines&mdash;not a composite unit as has been suggested. Finally, I erroneously referred in my earlier Statement to 12 Signal Regiment. The unit listed should have been 14 Signal Regiment.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.5/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-25">25 May 2006</phrase>, I informed the House that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had published its final report on the investigations into the incident that occurred with the phase 1 clinical trial for a drug in development known as TGN 1412 (<I>Official Report, </I>col. 95WS). I also announced the membership of the expert group established by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State under the chairmanship of Professor Gordon Duff, to consider what the incident revealed about the underlying science and how clinical trials involving these types of products should be managed in the future. I promised a further report to the House when the expert group provided its interim report.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.5/3">That interim report is being published tomorrow, <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-25">25 July</phrase>, together with the minutes of all its meetings, the documents submitted for its consideration and details of the evidence given by a wide range of stakeholders, all of which have contributed to its preliminary findings. A copy of the interim report will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.5/4">It is important to recognise that this is an interim report, that a public consultation will take place on its proposals and that further opportunities for interested parties to give evidence will be available in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.5/5">The Government are very grateful for the great deal of progress already made on this important issue by the expert group in the two months since it first met. The group anticipates completing its work in the autumn and I will provide a further report to the House when this report is available.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/2">The Electoral Administration Act received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>. The Act aims to tackle four areas at the core of a healthy democracy by improving access, by improving confidence, by extending openness and transparency of party financing and by maintaining professional delivery of elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/3">In line with the Government's commitment to bring as many of the important provisions in the Act into force as soon as possible, a commencement order has been made which includes the following key provisions:</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/4">new rules for transparency and permissibility of loans;registration provisions to apply to the 2006 annual canvass process;a package of offences in relation to postal voting applications and conduct of elections;provisions in relation to the regulation of political parties; and power for the Electoral Commission to set performance standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/5">The provisions in the Act to bring a similar regime of transparency and permissibility to that set out for donations in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) to loans from political parties will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">11 September 2006</phrase>. The Government consider that it is important for the new regime to be brought into force at the earliest opportunity. Political parties will be required to report to the Electoral Commission all regulated transactions existing at that date and any entered into between that date and the end of that month, within 30 days from the end of September. Taken together, the existing donations regime and the new regulated transactions regime provide a robust and transparent mechanism to ensure that significant financial benefits to political parties are disclosed.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/6">We have also brought into force a package of offences in the Electoral Administration Act that aim to improve the security and confidence of the electoral process. These will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">11 September 2006</phrase> and relate to the application for postal and proxy votes as well as to offences around the conduct of elections. We believe that it is vital that we tackle potential problems of fraud in relation to elections. Along with other provisions in the Act that will be brought into force in time for the May 2007 elections, we believe that this represents a comprehensive set of legislative changes that will improve the confidence in the electoral system.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/7">The Government are also committed to improving the accuracy of the register and to tackling potential registration fraud at the earliest opportunity. We have therefore commenced those provisions in the Act that relate to the annual canvass process so that they can be in place for the 2006 annual canvass. This includes the new duty on electoral registration officers (EROS) to carry out necessary steps to maintain the register and the new registration offence of supplying false information in connection with registration. Both these provisions will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">11 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/8">In addition, the Electoral Administration Act contains miscellaneous provisions in Part 7 that are designed to simplify and streamline procedures for the regulation of political parties. Many of these will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">11 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/9">The power for the Electoral Commission to set performance standards in relation to electoral activity will also come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>. This will allow the Electoral Commission to carry out the important preparatory work in relation to the performance standards scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.3/10">We aim for the Electoral Administration Act to be implemented in full, where possible, for the May 2007 elections. We will therefore be making subsequent commencement orders to commence the remaining provisions in the Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" name="Geoff Hoon">My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Mr Geoff Hoon)</phrase> will today lay before the House Foreign and Commonwealth Office Command Paper 6896 on prospects for the European Union 2006. This is the latest in a series of forward looks to the work programmes of the respective European Union presidencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/2">Copies will be placed in the Library of the House. Additional copies can also be obtained from the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. A copy will also be available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/3">The last White Paper was published in January at the conclusion of the UK presidency of the EU. This was a retrospective of our presidency as well as a forward look to the year ahead. The White Paper that I am laying before the House today is an update to the spring paper and sets out in more detail the priorities of the Finnish presidency over the next six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/4">The Finnish presidency began on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July</phrase>. The Finns have presented an ambitious programme for the next six months, which builds on the work of previous presidencies and addresses many important challenges for the European Union. We agree with the challenges identified by the Finns and welcome their proposed priority actions. In particular, we welcome the focus on follow-up to the Hampton Court agenda initiated under the UK presidency in October 2005. The informal meeting of the European Council in Lahti on <phrase class="date" code="">20 October</phrase> will focus on innovation and energy and will be an opportunity to look at the next steps that we collectively need to take to meet Europe's needs in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/5">The Finnish presidency also plans to take forward work in key areas such as tackling climate change, enlargement, competitiveness, security and migration. For example, we will see an open dialogue on the best way to drive international action on tackling climate change. This presidency will host a discussion on the Commission report on enlargement progress in the autumn. It will also oversee the mid-term review of the 2004 Hague programme, which will, among other issues, look at stronger EU co-operation to tackle illegal migration. The Finns hope to reach agreement on a number of important measures to boost European competitiveness, including final adoption of the services directive and increased investment in research and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/6">This agenda demonstrates the EU's commitment to delivering on issues of concern to our citizens. We welcome these priorities and look forward to working with the Finnish presidency over an important six months.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Nationality, Citizenship and Immigration (Joan Ryan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/2">The Justice and Home Affairs Council will be held today, <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase>, in Brussels. I am attending on behalf of the Home Office. I thought that it would be useful if I were to outline the main issues that I expect to be discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/3">The Council will take an initial presentation by the Commission on The Hague programme review. There will also be discussion of migration issues and, in the mixed committee format, the second generation Schengen information system. On the first of these, the Commission will present four communications: the future direction of The Hague programme, which includes a proposed use of Article 42 TEU (the passerelle clause); reviewing the implementation of The Hague programme to date (the scorecard); options for better evaluation of the impact of EU policies in the area of justice and home affairs (JHA); and a legislative proposal based on Article 67(2) TEC adapting the provisions of the European Court of Justice under Title IV (immigration, asylum and civil law matters). The presidency has indicated that it will focus on procedure and handling and is not looking for substantive discussion on these items at this Council. Detailed discussion, including in relation to the more controversial aspects, such as the possible use of Article 42 TEU (the passerelle clause) and Article 67(2) TEC (adapting the remit of the ECJ in Title IV) will take place later in the year, including at the September informal JHA Council in Finland. Those aspects aside, the Government's initial view is to welcome the focus on implementation and more effective evaluation contained in the communications.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/4">There will be information items on the EU preparations for the UN high-level dialogue on international migration and development and the report on the outcome of the Euro-African ministerial conference on migration and development held in Rabat on 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>. The Government welcome the adoption of the EU common position at the General Affairs and External Relations Council last week, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-13">13 July</phrase>; we will continue to feed into preparations for the UN high-level dialogue on international migration and development, which takes place in September. There will also be a presentation by the Commission and Frontex (EU border agency) on the situation in the Mediterranean and Africa. We expect there to be a focus on the continuing influx of illegal immigrants to the Canaries and Malta. The UK strongly supports EU joint operational activity in the Mediterranean and has offered technical assistance to the Spanish and Maltese authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/5">There will be discussion on the management of migration flows, specifically on the two Commission communications on a policy plan for legal migration and a common policy on illegal immigration. The presidency will be seeking a first exchange of views on both items. The UK will be encouraging solutions of sharing best practice and establishing common principles, while advising against inflexible, detailed prescription, especially in the form of legislative measures on labour access. The Government are fully committed to tackling the problem of illegal immigration of third-country nationals and notes with interest the Commission's communication; we will examine concrete proposals for measures when they are tabled in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/6">In the mixed committee format, the presidency will be hoping to agree a general approach on the key outstanding issues in the three legal instruments establishing SIS II&mdash;a regulation covering immigration aspects, a Council decision covering law enforcement aspects and a regulation covering access by vehicle registration authorities&mdash;with a view to reaching a First Reading deal with the European Parliament in September. This is the last opportunity to resolve the major outstanding issues within the Council before the expected EP vote in September. The UK will not participate in the regulation covering immigration but will participate in the other two legal instruments.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/7">Two further presentations by the Commission are expected in the margins of the meeting. These are on (i) a proposal for a regulation setting up the powers and the financing of teams of national border control experts of member states (rapid border intervention teams) to provide joint EU technical and operational assistance at the external EU border, co-ordinated by Frontex; and (ii) a proposal for a Community code on visas&mdash;a Schengen measure in which the UK will not participate. Although the UK will not participate in the first proposal, we support the concept of nominated experts deployed at short notice to respond to emergencies to help to enhance the security of the EU external border, but will wish to look carefully at the detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/8">Finally, there is likely to be a lunchtime presentation by Commissioner Franco Frattini on the issue of CIA rendition flights.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.1/1">My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/2">Careless handling of smokers' materials continues to be one of the major causes of UK accidental fire deaths in the home. Evidence has shown that reduced ignition propensity (RIP) cigarettes decrease the risk of inducing ignition or progressive smouldering in materials, therefore reducing the number of accidental fire deaths in the home.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/3">RIP cigarettes have been legislated for in New York State, California, Vermont, Illinois, New Hampshire and Massachusetts and are all now in place, as well as in Canada. The legislation requires that all cigarettes conform to American Society for Testing and Materials Standards (ASTM International).</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/4">At the request of the UK, supported by Sweden, the European Commission undertook to look into the case for developing an appropriate technical standard for RIP cigarettes. The Department for Communities and Local Government will be working very closely with the Department of Health, which has led government work on tobacco regulation, and the Department of Trade and Industry, which leads on consumer product safety. It is expected that further discussion on the case for developing a European technical standard for RIP cigarettes will take place at the next general product committee meeting in Brussels this September.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.1/1">The final report of the fraud review is published today and I have placed copies in the Libraries of both Houses. The Government are issuing it for consultation and seek responses by <phrase class="date" code="">27 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/2">The report outlines current arrangements for dealing with fraud, identifies gaps and shortcomings in the system and makes recommendations for dealing with them. The recommendations are wide-ranging and are aimed at improving fraud deterrence, prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution and penalties. Benefits will include reduction of fraud losses to taxpayers, consumers and businesses, and a reduction in the harm that fraud causes to individuals and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/3">The Government accept the analysis of the report and are sympathetic to the broad conclusions and recommendations, but we believe that the report would benefit from a wider public consultation. Implementation of the recommendations will be considered in the light of consultation responses and after further evaluation of the funding and legislative implications.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/2">In our December response to the Kate Barker review of housing supply, we committed to reform the planning delivery grant to support local housing delivery and to conduct a wider consultation on local planning and housing incentives. Today we launch the consultation on a proposal for a new housing and planning delivery grant and the criteria for allocations for the final year of the current planning delivery grant. The consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="">17 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/3">The Government's aim is to encourage local authorities to respond more effectively to local housing demand. Over 200,000 new households are formed each year, but last year just under 170,000 additional homes were built, with upward pressure on house prices as result. The Government believe that local authorities do not have sufficient incentives to respond to housing need.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/4">Under our proposals, a performance-related grant would be paid to local authorities as a reward for meeting the housing needs of the community and for improving planning performance. The proposal is part of the Government's package of measures to improve housing affordability and our commitment to create and maintain sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/5">The Government's aim with a new grant would be to encourage local authorities to become active in the delivery of new housing to meet local housing demand. The grant would be awarded to local authorities with high levels of demand that are delivering additional housing. The proposal envisages that the grant would continue to resource planning to ensure effective delivery of the new planning system.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/6">We are also consulting on the criteria to allocate &pound;120 million of planning delivery grant for the financial year 2007-08. Within this allocation, we are proposing to increase the percentage of planning delivery grant awarded to support housing. This is to ensure that the grant better supports areas that are delivering high numbers of new homes and areas struggling with issues of low demand. We plan to announce the first part of this grant in November 2006, with further announcements planned for spring 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/7">Copies of the <I>Planning Delivery Grant 2007/08: Proposed Allocations Criteria</I> have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and the document is available on the DCLG website at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1501792">www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1501792</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.3/8">The housing and planning delivery grant consultation paper will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses tomorrow and will be available from tomorrow afternoon on the DCLG website at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1017165">www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1017165</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/2">I am today updating the House on the housing and regeneration review, launched in April this year by the Deputy Prime Minister and David Miliband.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/3">This Government have an ambitious agenda for housing and regeneration. My letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July</phrase> to the Prime Minister outlined my vision for developing mixed communities and increasing the supply of affordable and market housing. Delivering this agenda requires a step change in our activities. It is therefore vital that we get our delivery arrangements absolutely right, with clear, focused and accountable delivery chains.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/4">The current review of housing and regeneration provides an important opportunity to build on the existing strengths of English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation and to ensure a coherent approach to delivering new housing and mixed sustainable communities. We must make the most of the skills and expertise of these bodies and maximise the use of private investment, public subsidy, landholdings and assets to support and deliver local and regional housing and regeneration strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/5">At the same time, the creation of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) as a new strategic department, focused on delivering for people and places, offers an opportunity to evaluate our wider departmental delivery chain for housing and regeneration. I have therefore asked my officials to undertake further work in three key areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/6">First, I have asked officials, in addition to addressing the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships, to examine the DCLG's delivery functions to determine the scope for rationalising existing delivery-focused activities across the piece. Secondly, I have asked officials to undertake a distinct stream of work on modernising the regulation of affordable housing, particularly in the light of the increasing involvement of the private sector. Finally and relatedly, I have asked officials to carry out further work and analysis on the range of potential modernisation and structural options for reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/7">I will make a further announcement in the autumn on my plans for creating a modern, dynamic delivery chain to support stronger communities and to create places in which people feel proud to live.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/2">I am deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Lebanon and in the Gaza Strip.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/3">In Lebanon, the crisis has led the UN to estimate that at least 500,000 people have been displaced. Insecurity and damaged infrastructure are making it difficult to reach those in need of medical care, food and water supplies. The supply of electricity has stopped to most villages and towns in southern Lebanon. Stocks of fuel will be exhausted in two weeks. Factories producing medicines, milk, wood and housing supplies have been destroyed. It is clear from aid agencies that they need immediate and safe access to the displaced and the wounded and those requiring humanitarian assistance. I support the proposals by the UN and ICRC for safe humanitarian access, but ultimately the security situation needs to stabilise in order to ensure that vital assistance can get to where it is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/4">We have responded to international appeals for humanitarian aid. Following the initial response that I announced last week, I am today committing a further &pound;2.2 million to support humanitarian relief, including for the UN flash appeal, which has been launched today. The UN Central Emergency Response Fund is also providing an initial contribution of $5 million, of which the UK share is $1.4 million (&pound;770,000). This brings the total UK commitment to &pound;5 million, and we stand ready to do more as needed. DfID is deploying two humanitarian advisers to the region. Two stabilisation and recovery advisers will join them shortly. The Post Conflict Reconstruction Unit is helping cross-government planning for the UK's contribution to stabilisation and recovery, immediately hostilities cease.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/5">The situation in Gaza is also very difficult. Following the Israeli attack on Gaza's only power station, electricity is limited to supplies received from Israel. Households receive six to eight hours' electricity per day. Electricity is vital for hospitals and clinics, which need constant supplies of power to run medical equipment and to keep drugs at constant temperatures. It is needed to pump fresh water to houses and to treat sewage. It is essential for the safe storage of food and for processing flour to make bread. Most households in Gaza are receiving two hours of water per day. This means that they do not have reliable access to water for drinking, personal hygiene and washing clothes. According to the World Health Organisation, cases of diarrhoea among refugee children in Gaza in early July were 50 per cent higher than at the same period last year. Humanitarian supplies are vital. The Rafah crossing was opened temporarily on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-18">18 July</phrase> to allow those stranded at the crossing in desperate conditions to enter and the Karni crossing was temporarily opened for humanitarian and commercial imports, but both are now closed again. Action is needed to ensure unrestricted humanitarian access, including the supply of medical equipment, fuel, food and electricity.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/6">In April, the UK made a contribution of &pound;15 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides basic services for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. This is helping UNRWA to provide healthcare and other basic services to Palestinian refugees, who comprise 70 per cent of Gaza's population. The EU collectively provides over half of UNRWA's funding and the UK last year was the third largest bilateral donor.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/7">The European Union has established a temporary international mechanism to support the basic needs of the Palestinian people. The mechanism will provide support to health, education and social affairs, help to pay for utilities and assist the very poorest Palestinians. The UK stands ready to allocate up to &pound;12 million to the mechanism, plus our share of the European Community contribution, giving a total of up to &pound;25 million. The mechanism has already enabled much needed fuel supplies for emergency generators after Gaza's only power station was damaged by military action. These fuel deliveries are keeping hospitals open, water pumps going and waste treatment plants open. The mechanism will soon start making payments to health workers in both Gaza and the West Bank to ensure that they can continue to provide essential medical care. We welcome the decision of G8 leaders to immediately expand the mechanism to provide wider assistance to the people of Gaza, and we are working closely with the quartet and others to ensure that this happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/8">The UK is also providing assistance to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs to enable it to monitor closely the humanitarian situation in Gaza to assist donors and others to make sure that help gets to those who need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/9">It is particularly important for the humanitarian welfare of innocent civilians in Lebanon, Israel and Gaza that there is an end to the violence on all sides. The UK Government support efforts to put in place a durable ceasefire.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Tom Watson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/2">Late last year, it emerged that inconsistent criteria had been used for deciding payments over the history of the ex-gratia payment scheme for former Far East prisoners of war and civilian internees. In response to this, my predecessor, the then Veterans Minister (Don Touhig), agreed that there should be an independent investigation to examine how the use of inconsistent criteria had arisen and why this had not been exposed earlier. Mr David Watkins, a retired senior civil servant from the Northern Ireland Office, was appointed to undertake this work and his findings were presented to me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase>. A copy of his report has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/3">The report finds no evidence of culpable behaviour by individuals but identifies a number of shortcomings with the scheme's development and administration and makes recommendations designed to avoid any recurrence.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/4">I am grateful to Mr Watkins for an investigation that has been thorough and far-reaching, and has included consultation with the key representatives of those who were adversely affected by the errors. I welcome his report and can say now that we accept the overall thrust of its recommendations. We will analyse it in more detail, in consultation with other interested departments, and I intend to give a more detailed response in a further Statement after the Recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/5">While the errors in administering the scheme were deeply regrettable, I would echo the report's recognition of the admirable work undertaken by the then War Pensions Agency and others that allowed the scheme to be introduced in a remarkably short timescale, with some 14,000 payments made within three months of the scheme's introduction and a total of over 25,000 payments now made.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/6">Finally, I know that there has been a residual concern that a number of those who do not qualify under the scheme may be experiencing hardship. To respond to this concern, my officials have been in discussion with the charity that provides support in such cases among those from the UK who were once prisoners of war or civilian internees in the Far East. I am pleased to announce that the Ministry of Defence will shortly be providing financial assistance to support the charity's work in dealing with such cases and to help to publicise the recently announced changes to the criteria, as a result of which eligibility under the scheme has been extended to those who can show a close link to the UK since the Second World War.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-15">15 May</phrase>, Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly were recalled to participate in a process to secure the full restoration of the institutions in Northern Ireland on or before <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.153.1/3">Following their discussions with the Northern Ireland political parties in Parliament Buildings, Stormont, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-29">29 June</phrase>, the Prime Minister and Taoiseach issued a statement that again reiterated their commitment to the November deadline and called for all sides to commit to a period of genuine and frank political engagement on the outstanding issues in the months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/4">A work plan was also published alongside the statement in order to assist the parties in their work between now and the November deadline. Both the statement and the work plan have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/5">The plan allows for the Committee on the Preparation for Government to continue its valuable work during the Summer Recess, and I have recently provided for the creation of subgroups within the committee to deal with the issues of devolution of justice and policing, changes to the institutions and the economic challenges facing Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/6">I have made it clear previously that, in the event that devolved government is not restored on or before <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>, all MLAs' salaries and allowances will be cancelled with immediate effect. I have repeatedly stressed that it remains the Government's firm hope that devolution can and will be restored by that deadline, but I wish to ensure that MLAs have the fullest of opportunities to arrange their affairs in advance. My officials have therefore written to all MLAs explaining the implications of the termination of allowances for MLAs in respect of their responsibilities as employers of their staff and for their constituency offices. A copy of this letter has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/2">I am pleased to announce the severance package for the estimated 1,500 MoD civilians in Northern Ireland being made redundant during the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2008</phrase> as a result of the process of normalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/3">The House will recall that, when I announced the package for the Royal Irish (Home Service) (R IRISH (HS)) on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March 2006</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 961), I explained that a process of consultation would take place with the trades unions on the civilian redundancies in accordance with our duties under Section 188 of the Trade Unions and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. That consultation has now been concluded and the redundancy package has been decided.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/4">First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the dedication and commitment shown by MoD civilians in Northern Ireland over many years in supporting the Armed Forces and in helping to bring about the enabling environment for the current security normalisation programme. While normalisation is good news for Northern Ireland, it also brings substantial change for our civilian workforce, and my department has been working hard to draw up an enhanced redundancy package for those affected. I am now in a position to provide details of that package.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/5">In addition to the normal occupational redundancy package (which, for the majority, will be compulsory terms under the Civil Service Compensation Scheme (CSCS)), affected staff will receive a flat-rate financial recognition award (FRA) payment of &pound;14,000 gross. The payment is being made to MoD civilians based in Northern Ireland in recognition of a unique set of circumstances, which are a combination of the following factors:</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/6">the pressures and restrictions arising from their association with the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland, which they experienced while working for the MoD and are likely to continue to affect them in the immediate aftermath of being made redundant;the difficulties that they may experience as a result of normalisation and directly arising from their former association with the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland; andthe effect of those pressures being exacerbated by the fact that the whole of the R IRISH (HS) is being disbanded, affecting over 3,000 individuals and nearly 50 per cent of the civilian workforce are losing their jobs over a compressed timescale.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/7">In summary, during the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2008</phrase>, MoD civil servants made redundant through the process of normalisation will receive:</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/8">redundancy compensation under the terms of their occupational redundancy scheme;access to the MoD outplacement service for a period of 12 months (an increase over the normal six months);a retraining allowance of up to &pound;1,000 per person, anda flat-rate additional payment of &pound;14,000 gross.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/9">The package, which goes significantly beyond statutory entitlements, is well deserved and we hope will be well received by MoD civilians in Northern Ireland. To put this into context, typically an individual who is aged 50 or over and made redundant between <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2008</phrase> will receive the immediate payment of an enhanced pension (and a tax-free pension lump sum for those in the 1972 section of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS)), redundancy compensation of up to six months' pensionable pay and the FRA of &pound;14,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/10">To give examples, a 51 year-old band C with an average salary of &pound;26,167 and 31 years' service will receive a lump sum payment of &pound;27,084 (this is the redundancy compensation and the FRA); in addition, they will receive their pension lump sum of approximately &pound;30,419 and an annual pension. A 54 year-old band E/skill zone 3 with an average salary of &pound;17,975 and 34 years' service will receive a lump sum payment of &pound;22,987 (this is the redundancy compensation and the FRA); in addition, they will receive their pension lump sum of approximately &pound;25,136 and an annual pension. Those staff under the age of 50 and made redundant in the same period will typically receive a preserved pension payable at age 60, redundancy compensation up to three times their annual pensionable pay and the FRA of &pound;14,000. To illustrate, a 34 year-old band E/skill zone 3 with an average salary of &pound;17,975 and 16 years' service will receive a lump sum payment of &pound;43,958; and a 27 year-old band D/skill zone 4 with an average salary of &pound;20,617 and nine years' service will receive a lump sum payment of &pound;29,463. These lump sums are the combined totals of redundancy compensation and the FRA. Redundancy compensation and the FRA combined will be tax free up to the first &pound;30,000 in accordance with the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/11">This is a generous package for a unique set of circumstances for those MoD civilians in Northern Ireland made redundant between <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan Ryan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/2">The Privy Council has made an Order in Council&mdash;the Consular Fees (Amendment) Order 2006&mdash;which gives authority for a revision in passport fees. The revision will take effect on <phrase class="date" code="">5 October 2006</phrase>. The fee for a standard 32-page passport will increase from &pound;51 to &pound;66, while the fee for a 48-page passport will increase from &pound;62.50 to &pound;77. The fee for a passport for a child will increase from &pound;34 to &pound;45. The fee for an adult using the guaranteed one-week counter service for a standard 32-page passport will increase from &pound;77.50 to &pound;91, for a child from &pound;70 to &pound;80, and for a 48-page jumbo from &pound;87 to &pound;97. The fee for an adult using the guaranteed same-day service for a standard 32-page passport will increase from &pound;96.50 to &pound;108, for a child from &pound;83 to &pound;93, and for a 48-page passport from &pound;104.50 to &pound;114.50. The fee for a collective passport, for organised trips for schools and youth groups, will remain unchanged at &pound;39.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/3">This increase represents the second stage of the two-year fee agreement reached with HM Treasury last year. This followed a stringent review of costs to ensure that the fee for each type of passport service closely reflects the production costs accrued by that service and bears its share of the cost of consular protection services. This increase will deliver extensive improvements required in the ongoing efforts to combat passport and identity fraud.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions Reform (James Purnell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June</phrase>, I wrote to Members to advise them that I had commissioned a review of the administration of the financial assistance scheme and would report the outcome before the Summer Recess. In particular, I was concerned about ensuring that all eligible people receive payments as quickly as possible, that we ensure the most cost-efficient operation and that we examine a full range of options for the appropriate organisational location of the operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.3/3">Today I have placed copies of the findings of the review in the Library. These show that obtaining data from trustees is the key to making payments and highlight the need to significantly strengthen the skills within the financial assistance scheme operations needed to obtain these data, concluding that this can best be achieved through an injection of skills from the private sector or the Pension Protection Fund. These skills can best be managed from within DWP.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.3/4">The review has also identified the scope for some operational efficiencies and more detailed work will be undertaken to establish optimum staffing levels. In addition, it has concluded that the long-term governance of the operational unit is best placed in the Pension Service. Overall we expect these changes to increase the speed at which people receive help from the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.3/5">I have now commissioned work to implement the findings and will update on implementation in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.3/6">I am also pleased to announce that today we have published the draft Financial Assistance Scheme (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2006. These regulations will bring into effect the extension to the financial assistance scheme announced in the White Paper on pension reform on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-25">25 May</phrase>. We will be consulting on the draft regulations over the next eight weeks and will publish a response to the consultation along with the final version of the draft regulations. Copies of the draft regulations and consultation document have been placed in the Library and can also be found on the FAS website at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/fas">www.dwp.gov.uk/fas</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.1/1">I have today placed in the Library of the House copies of the first annual report of the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland and of its business plan for the coming year.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/2">While the new service was formally launched in June 2005, it initially took work only from the six police districts that make up the PPS Belfast region. It has, however, been planned from the start as a regional service and the last year has seen good progress in rolling out the service over the whole of Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/3">In August 2005, the PPS western and southern region assumed responsibility for the conduct of all youth offences occurring in the PSNI's Armagh, Banbridge and Newry and Mourne districts, as well as all prosecutions from the five police districts within Fermanagh and Tyrone. A new Lisburn office, serving as headquarters of the PPS eastern region, opened in March 2006 and will be fully operational by October of this year, when it will add a further six police districts to those already within the PPS structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/4">The rollout of the PPS will continue through this year and next, and when completed will operate from six regional offices planned for Belfast, Lisburn, Newry, Omagh, Londonderry and Ballymena. This regional approach, with each office having its own regional prosecutor, will encourage local involvement with the service, helping the community to understand its work and how it goes about reaching decisions, and thereby building public confidence in the criminal justice system. The annual report and business plan is part of this process and will be of interest to anyone with an interest in the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland or in criminal justice generally.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/2">I have today laid before Parliament the annual reports and accounts for 2005-06 for the eight regional development agencies (RDAs) outside London. Copies have been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/3">The annual report and accounts for London are presented to the Lord Mayor rather than before Parliament. I shall provide a copy to the House of Commons Library when these are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/4">The Government welcome the contribution that the RDAs have made during this year to driving forward economic development in their respective regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/5">Also published today are the RDAs' reported outputs for 2005-06. These results are evidence that the RDAs continue to play a valuable role in improving the economic performance of the English regions; through working with their partners, the RDAs are making a real difference to the individual regional economies concerned. The figures cover the creation and safeguarding of jobs, the number of people helped to get a job, the amount of brownfield land brought back into use, the number of businesses added to the regional economies, the number of businesses helped to improve their performance, the number of learning opportunities created and the amount of private sector investment attracted benefiting deprived areas, all as a result of RDA activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/6">Press releases on the outputs have been issued in each region. Copies of the output results have been placed in the House Library, and are also available on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/regional/regional-dev-agencies/index.html">www.dti.gov.uk/regional/regional-dev-agencies/index.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.1/1">The 2005 annual report on strategic export controls will be published today as a Command Paper. Copies will be placed in the Library of the House. The report describes UK policy and international developments in export control regimes, as well as information on export licensing decisions taken during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.1/2">The annual report on strategic export controls is an innovation of this Government. This report, the ninth annual report (the first report was published in 1997), is a step away from the traditional reports of the past. Our export licensing system is one of the most rigorous and transparent regimes in the world and the annual report, in this new format, symbolises our continued commitment to accountability and transparency by presenting detailed information in a more modern and user-friendly format. This year, due to the increasing volume of information on strategic exports that is being published by the Government, all the statistical data that were historically published only in hard copy are now made available on a CD-ROM which accompanies the report. Since 2004, the Government have also produced detailed quarterly reports available on the internet, ensuring that the UK provides some of the most open and timely export licensing information available anywhere. The new CD-ROM includes the quarterly reports for 2005, as well as more consolidated data, information on licence refusals and fuller information on trade control (trafficking and brokering) licences issued during 2005. The complete report will be available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website and also published through The Stationery Office.</p>

The target included for Merseyside unfortunately used an interim version of Merseyside's target, rather than the final target that was adopted. Incorporating the final target has a small beneficial effect on the national journey time target, lowering it by just 0.03 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/3">The revised success criteria is therefore as follows: the target will be deemed to have been met if, on target routes in the 10 largest urban areas in England, an average increase in travel of 4.4 per cent is accommodated within an increase of 3.6 per cent in person journey time per mile.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.5/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/2">I am today announcing 14 major new measures to ensure that the release of data from the UK vehicle registers is undertaken in a way that:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/3">protects vehicle keepers from misuse of their information;ensures that those who have reasonable cause can get the data they need;balances the right to privacy of individuals whose data are held on the register with the need of others to gain proper redress;is cost-effective, in that the costs to all are proportionate to the benefits that the scheme delivers; andis right in principle and works in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/4">This follows the review that I announced in December last year and the public consultation launched in February this year. I will give a full update on progress in delivering these new measures in the autumn. I will continue to scrutinise closely the way in which the scheme operates and how it is used. Should further action be merited, I will ensure that it is taken quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/5">The new measures are as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/6"><I>New requirements for evidence of &quot;reasonable cause&quot;</I></p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/7">New detailed guidance on what is likely to constitute &quot;reasonable cause&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/8">Clarity that behaviour in using data will be considered in judging whether a particular applicant's assertions as to the &quot;reasonable cause&quot; for his application are to be believed, and in deciding whether approved conditional access is granted or maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/9">For all applications where &quot;reasonable cause&quot; relates to a vehicle left on land without permission or in breach of terms and conditions, evidence is required that the applicant is the landowner or has the permission of the landowner to pursue the vehicle keeper.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/10">For all applications where &quot;reasonable cause&quot; relates to the pursuit of a penalty charge, evidence is required that a penalty scheme was indeed in place on that piece of land (eg that there was signage).</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/11"><I>New requirements for &quot;approved conditional access&quot;</I></p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/12">Those bodies and companies seeking approved conditional access that do not have an appropriate regulatory body are required to be current members of an &quot;accredited&quot; trade association. Part of the process for &quot;accrediting&quot; trade associations will include ensuring that there is a clear and enforced code of conduct (for example, relating to conduct, parking charge signage, charge levels, appeals procedure, approval of ticket wording, and appropriate pursuit of penalties, eg approach by letter only and county court action only to permit a house call).</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/13">Organisations that do not comply with the terms of the accredited trade association will be expelled and without valid membership of another accredited trade association will lose their approved conditional access. Trade associations that do not police the conditions of membership adequately will lose their accreditation.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/14">All those seeking approved conditional access will be required to serve a &quot;probationary&quot; period of six months or, if longer, for the period of time that it takes to make 20 requests&mdash;during which all requests should be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/15"><I>New measures to ensure awareness of the vehicle keeper</I></p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/16">That all those who receive data, as evidence of their &quot;reasonable behaviour&quot; and as a condition of &quot;approved conditional access&quot;, include in any correspondence with the keeper a leaflet or statement advising them of:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/17">the &quot;reasonable cause&quot; which formed the basis of the request;the &quot;complaints&quot; procedure by which a data subject can notify both DVLA and the Information Commissioner if they believe that their data have been used inappropriately; andthe appeals procedure (for the regulatory body) if they feel that, for example, a parking charge notice has been issued incorrectly.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/18">And that this information is also placed on the DVLA website.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/19">That DVLA maintain on its website a list of organisations and companies that have requested data and the reasons for their request.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/20">That a reference to the location on the DVLA website of guidance and advice and all other information relating to the release of vehicle keeper data is included on all DVLA documentation sent to the vehicle keeper, including the annual VED reminder.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/21"><I>New auditing procedures and action to combat misuse or complaints</I></p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/22">A rolling three-year programme of audit check, including targeted checks on those where concerns have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/23">A clear set of procedures where such concerns are raised:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/24">an audit is triggered by complaints of substance representing a disproportionate level of granted requests or any complaint of a serious nature;if, following implementation of the audit recommendations, a disproportionate level of complaints of substance is received, an organisation with approved conditional access will be required to submit requests on a case-by-case basis; if it is already subject to request on a case-by-case basis, it will be subject to additional scrutiny of each request that it makes; andif a disproportionate level of further complaints of substance is received and a company is found to be consistently using data inappropriately or a serious complaint of abuse of the system by an applicant is substantiated, then there is a distinct possibility that we will not believe the applicant to have reasonable cause on a future request and, if so, data release would then be declined in that case.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/25"><I>New complaints procedures</I></p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/26">A clear procedure by which data subjects can notify DVLA if they feel that their data have been used inappropriately; steps must be taken to draw this to the attention of vehicle keepers by including information in paperwork sent to them and on the DVLA website. This will include information of how they can notify the Information Commissioner of the misuse of their data.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.5/27">Complaints received will form part of the evaluation of whether an applicant's assertion of &quot;reasonable cause&quot; is valid.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/2">Members will be interested to know that the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) will be jointly consulting on ways of making water efficiency mandatory, during the Recess. The scope of the consultation will cover water efficiency in new homes, in existing buildings and in respect of the domestic uses of non-household buildings. We are considering a range of measures, including amendments to the Building Regulations 2000. There will be a slightly longer consultation than normal&mdash;four months rather than three&mdash;as we recognised the difficulty of consulting during a holiday period.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/3">Copies of the consultation document will be available later in the year on both the DCLG and Defra websites and in the Libraries of both Houses. I will be writing separately to Peter Ainsworth, chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee, Michael Jack, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, and Dr Phyllis Starkey, chairman of the Communities and Local Government Committee.</p>
