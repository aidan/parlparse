	EU: Agriculture and Fisheries Council
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-01-21a.63.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="63"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100121-wms0001.htm#10012118000109">
	<p pid="a.63.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/2">My honourable friends the Ministers for Marine and the Natural Environment (Huw Irranca-Davies), and Food, Farming and Environment (Jim Fitzpatrick) represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-20">20 November</phrase>. Richard Lochhead MSP and Michelle Gildernew MLA also attended. Due to the European Council, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council was shortened to one day, with the majority of agriculture business now being taken in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/3">On agriculture, the council approved Poland's state aid application enabling farmers to purchase agricultural land. The UK, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Spain, Netherlands, Austria, Germany all abstained, agreeing with the Commission that the application was not justified, and on the overriding of state aid rules, but stopped short of blocking the application. Latvia and Hungary would now bring similar applications for approval at the December Agriculture Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/4">There was a brief discussion to clarify member states' voting intentions with regard to the authorisation of GM maize for use in the EU. There was no qualified majority in favour of the authorisation and the proposal will now revert to Commission competence and be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/5">A number of issues were raised under any other agriculture business. Belgium and France requested that export refunds for the fresh and frozen pigmeat be reactivated. Only the UK and Malta expressed dissatisfaction with the use of such market management measures. The Commission sympathised with the request but also did not agree with reactivating export refunds.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/6">France outlined its support for the Commission's forthcoming Green Paper on forest protection, emphasising the importance of taking a holistic approach-covering everything from the benefits that forests bring in respect of climate change, to forest-based industries. A number of member states, including the UK, supported emphasising the importance of the EU forest action plan and a member state-led approach. The Commission agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/7">France requested more details about the parameters within which the Commission intended to prepare for and conduct the forthcoming WTO ministerial conference. The Commission emphasised that these were regular events and that trade colleagues within the council were informed of the Commission's approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/8">Hungary, supported by the Czech Republic and Slovakia, presented a paper seeking to resurrect a proposal, previously rejected through comitology, that sheep and goats going direct to slaughter on intra-Community trade do not have to be electronically identified. The UK also intervened to sympathise and, while making it clear that it would not go back on its agreement not to seek further changes, urged the Commission to thoroughly review implementation of the regulation at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/9">With regard to fisheries and the technical conservation measures regulation, council reached political agreement (with the UK and Ireland voting against) on an interim compromise for 18 months only of the current annual provisions governing mesh sizes, gear types and catch composition, having failed to agree the main framework proposal. This was in the context of the impending entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, which would require co-decision with the European Parliament on this aspect of fisheries. An absence of any decision would have left a legal gap on such technical measures from <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> given that current measures are in the annual fishing opportunities regulation, which will remain as a council-only decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/10">The UK and Ireland worked very hard in bilaterals with the presidency and the Commission to find an acceptable solution. The Commission was inflexible, claiming that the relaxation of the relevant catch composition measures would be detrimental to haddock stocks. The UK asserted that this had no effect on fishing mortality and merely led to increased discarding. Regrettably, the presidency was not able to accept UK and Irish requests and a final compromise was agreed with no concessions offered. Agreement was reached by qualified majority, with the final formal adoption by written procedure by <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/11">The Commission then updated the council on the progress of the annual fisheries negotiations with Norway. It explained that the negotiations were particularly difficult this year after the Community's decision not to allow Norway to access mackerel in the North Sea. It is therefore possible that the negotiations will carry on into 2010 or even fail completely, with the danger of a precipitate rush to fish quotas and no access to each other's waters. The UK underlined the need for a balanced outcome on mackerel and the need for progress on the Danish discards initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/12">Next, the proposal fixing the 2010 total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for the Black Sea was agreed. The TAC for turbot was increased to 96 tonnes from the 76 proposed by the Commission (a 4 per cent reduction, not 24 per cent) on condition that Bulgaria and Romania developed by <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-15">15 February 2010</phrase> national plans to control the turbot fisheries and landings. The Commission also announced that it would speak to Turkey about its introducing similar measures for turbot.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/13">Finally, two issues were raised under any other fisheries business. The Commission had tabled a seven-page statement outlining its plans to combat seabird by-catch. The UK underlined the importance of this, calling for the Commission to publish a formal action plan, as this would give a chance for a full consultation with stakeholders including the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/14">Italy called for the cut in bluefin tuna quota agreed at the recent International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) meeting to be phased in by 15 per cent per year.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.3/1">I am today launching public consultations for the new InterCity East Coast, Greater Anglia and Essex Thameside franchises. The formal accreditation process for bidders for Greater Anglia and Essex Thameside also starts today.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/2">Our overall aim for the new franchises is to continue the existing operations and make improvements based on emerging value for money and affordability requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/3">The InterCity East Coast franchise will build on the new east coast main line timetable that is being introduced in May 2011 to take advantage of planned infrastructure enhancements to enable extra trains to run, to accelerate journey times and to introduce a standard interval clockface timetable. Further major service improvements are proposed from 2016, when super-express trains will be introduced, providing more capacity, more frequent trains and shorter journey times. Franchisees will also be asked for proposals to improve the overall passenger experience, including better stations, improved catering and simpler ticketing.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/4">Passengers on the Greater Anglia franchise are set to benefit from longer trains, enhancements at stations, more security and other service improvements. The new franchise operator will have to consider quicker journey times between Norwich and London, improving the performance and reliability of long-distance services and introducing minimum catering standards on InterCity trains. It will also set national passenger survey targets for trains, stations and customer service, with a requirement to invest more to make improvements in those areas if it fails to meet those targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/5">Passengers on the Essex Thameside franchise will benefit from longer trains and better security. The new operator will be expected to provide better service information for passengers and improved facilities at stations, including more secure cycle spaces and additional car parking facilities. It will also be required to monitor service quality and to ensure that stations and trains are cleaned and maintained to a high standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/6">The new Greater Anglia franchise will begin operation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">Friday 1 April 2011</phrase>, Essex Thameside on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-29">Sunday 29 May 2011</phrase> and InterCity East Coast in autumn 2011. All three franchises are proposed to last for a franchise term of at least 10 years with provisions made to allow the termination of the contracts earlier if the franchise fails to deliver good-quality service to passengers. The franchise length may also be extended dependent on proposals to deliver investment and significant passenger benefit. Any such proposals would have to offer good value for money to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/7">The consultation documents set out the main challenges that the new franchises will face and highlight the key requirements that the department currently proposes to include within each invitation to tender (ITT). They set out proposals to increase peak capacity and to improve security, access to stations and overall service quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/8">Responses to the consultations will inform the development of the invitation to tender that bidders for each franchise will be asked to bid against. We expect to publish the ITT for both Greater Anglia and Essex Thameside in summer 2010 and will award these franchises in late 2010 and early 2011. The ITT for InterCity East Coast will be published in autumn 2010. The franchise will be awarded in summer 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/9">Over the coming weeks the department will be having extensive discussions with local interested stakeholders, via a series of stakeholder meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/10">All three consultations will run until <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-19">19 April 2010</phrase>. Copies of the consultation documents, as well as the recently published discussion paper on general franchise policy, have been placed in the House Library and are available on the Department for Transport website.</p>
