	<p pid="a.27.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (Michael Wills) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May</phrase>, I informed the House that the Government had published a consultation document, <I>Archives for the 21</I><I>st</I><I> Century</I>, asking for views on a proposed new policy for archival services. The Government specifically sought views on five main proposals to help the sector build the foundations for a more sustainable future and respond to the challenges of the digital information age.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/3">This consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-12">12 August</phrase> and the Government are grateful for all the responses they received from a wide range of individuals and organisations. Based on the feedback received, which was largely supportive, I have today laid before the House a revised and final version of the policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/4">The policy outlines a new framework for the sustainable development and improvement of the publicly funded archive sector, which supports the sector and maximises opportunities to make archives accessible to an even wider range of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/5">The National Archives and the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council now wish to encourage professional bodies, individual institutions and other key stakeholders to help them shape a detailed action plan. This will take forward the policy's five recommendations with the aim of strengthening this key part of the nation's historical, cultural and information infrastructure. Between today and the end of January 2010 they will be consulting widely on a draft of the plan, and developing it in light of comments received.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/6">A copy of the policy has been placed in the Library of the House, along with a report on the responses received during the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Michael Wills) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement in the other place:</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/2">I am today publishing the consultation paper on the future of the edited register (CP 46/09). In October 2007, the Prime Minister announced that he had asked Dr Mark Walport, the director of the Wellcome Trust and Richard Thomas, the then Information Commissioner, to undertake an independent review of the framework for the use of personal information in the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/3">Their final report was published as the <I>Data Sharing Review</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-11">11 July 2008</phrase> and recommended various specific measures that the authors considered needed to be taken to increase public trust and confidence in the handling and processing of personal data by both the public and private sectors. The Government have already taken on board many of the review's recommendations, including, for example, strengthening the powers and penalties available to the Information Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/4">Recommendation 19 of the report covered the edited version of the electoral register which, since 2002, has been available for sale to anyone for any purpose. People are free to opt out of inclusion in the edited register if they so wish. Nevertheless, the <I>Data Sharing Review</I> recommended that the Government should remove the provision allowing the sale of the edited electoral register and that it should therefore be abolished.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/5">The report's authors argued that it sends a poor message to the public that personal information collected for something as vital as participation in the democratic process could be sold on to &quot;anyone for any purpose&quot; and that the sale of the edited register may deter some people from registering to vote at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/6">The Government take the issues of data protection, the privacy of citizens and democratic engagement, including electoral registration, very seriously. It is for these reasons that the Government committed, in their response to the <I>Data Sharing Review</I>, to consult on the future of the edited register. However, abolition of the edited register could have an impact on those businesses, charities and others that currently use it. The Government therefore do not wish to make a final decision to act until they have considered carefully the available evidence about the potential impact of abolition.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/7">It is hoped that the consultation I am publishing today will elicit detailed evidence and information from a wide range of sources on the potential impact of abolition, which will help to inform future policy decisions about the edited register. The wide range of options proposed in the consultation paper provides a variety of potential approaches to the future of the edited register and the Government invite views on all of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/8">The consultation shall run for a period of three months and closes on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-23">23 February 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/9">A copy of the consultation paper and impact assessment has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.1/3">Items on the main agenda are: patients' rights in cross-border healthcare; incentives for effective antibiotics, e-health; the three aspects of the pharmaceutical package (proposals to reduce the threat from counterfeit medicines, strengthening of Community pharmacovigilance and information on prescription medicines to patients); alcohol and health; smoke-free environments; seasonal influenza vaccination and information from the presidency and the Commission on pandemic H1N1 following the council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-12">12 October</phrase>, together with a discussion on lessons learnt on H1N1 preparedness and future challenges faced.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">The presidency propose to ask Ministers to reach political agreement on the directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. The presidency also propose to adopt council conclusions on innovative incentives for effective antibiotics, safe and efficient healthcare through e-health and alcohol and health. They also propose to adopt a council recommendation on smoke-free environments. The UK can support the adoption of these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/5">Although the main agenda currently proposes the adoption of a recommendation on seasonal influenza vaccination, this is still at an early stage in negotiation and we anticipate that adoption at this forthcoming council will not be possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/6">Under any other business, information will be provided from the presidency on a directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation. Information will also be provided on Commission communications on cancer, combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries and reducing health inequalities in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.3/12">The presidency set out their plans for the informal European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-19">19 November</phrase>, which has since taken decisions on the new President of the European Council and High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/13"><I>Post-2010 Lisbon Strategy</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/14">The Commission introduced a reflection paper on the future of the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth after 2010. The paper set out four priorities: creating value by basing growth on knowledge; empowering people and fighting exclusion; creating a competitive greener economy; and making Europe mobile and connected. The paper proposed that the European Council should steer the strategy and set objectives, and the Commission should undertake a yearly review of progress. The presidency sought views on these ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/15">I noted the need to draw a line under the process of treaty reform so that the Union could address the issues of most concern to citizens across Europe; namely jobs, competitiveness with emerging economies and individual economic opportunities. Member states needed to address these issues in a united fashion, maintaining the fiscal stimulus until such time as growth was established. I said that the Government supported the Commission's paper, except for two points: we wanted it to emphasise more clearly the need to open markets yet further and to avoid protectionism; and to promote and deepen the single market.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/16">The presidency concluded that they would take Ministers' comments into account in the formulation of the December European Council conclusions, and looked forward to finalisation of the strategy under the Spanish presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/17"><I> EU Sustainable Development Strategy</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/18">The presidency invited member states to consider which areas should be priorities for the future of the sustainable development strategy, and how implementation and monitoring of the strategy could be improved. The Commission confirmed that four priorities had emerged since its communication was published in July:the move to a low carbon, low input economy; protection of biodiversity, water and other natural resources; social inclusion; and the international dimension.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/19">The presidency concluded that it would take Ministers' views into account in its preparations for the December European Council. The Government welcome the sustainable development strategy, and want to ensure that it is well co-ordinated with other EU strategies such as the Lisbon strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/20"><I> External Relations</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/21">The full text of all conclusions adopted can be found at: <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/111287.pdf">http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/111287.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/22"><I>Afghanistan</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/23">The special representative of the UN Secretary-General, Kai Eide, briefed Ministers on the situation while underscoring the challenges and need for a greater sense of shared priorities amongst the international community. The UK has reiterated its offer to use London as a venue for a possible international conference on Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/24"><I>Russia</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/25">The presidency ran through the issues for the EU-Russia summit on 18-<phrase class="date" code="2009-11-19">19 November</phrase>. I stressed that it was important to maintain a regular and respectful dialogue with Russia, but that the EU should be robust in defending its interests and speaking with one voice to send clear messages. Following a wide-ranging discussion, the presidency concluded that the priorities for the summit were: climate change, energy, WTO/trade issues, human rights and the common neighbourhood.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/26"><I>Ukraine</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/27">The presidency said that at the EU-Ukraine summit on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-04">4 December</phrase> they would urge Ukraine: to get the IMF programme back on track; to ensure funding mechanisms were in place to pay its gas bills; to conduct free and fair presidential elections; and as soon as possible to undertake constitutional reform. I stressed the need to push Ukraine hard on compliance with the conditions attached to the IMF programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/28"><I> </I><I>MEPP</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/29">High Representative Solana briefed Ministers on the latest state of play on the region. The presidency said the EU needed to continue working on how it could practically support a settlement, in case prospects improved, and continue to support the Fayyad plan. The Government broadly support the presidency's approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/30"><I> Somalia</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/31">The presidency dropped this item from the external relations agenda. However, EU Defence Ministers did discuss Somalia at their informal meeting, as reported below.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/32"><I>AOB: European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) civilian capabilities</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/33">The presidency emphasised that the development of civilian capabilities was of critical importance to ESDP and to the EU's ability to operate as a global actor. The Government strongly support this position.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/34"><I> AOB: Belarus</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/35">Latvia debriefed Ministers on a recent visit to Minsk, and concluded that the EU should continue to monitor the behaviour of the Belarusian authorities, and assess its policy on the basis of progress against agreed human rights benchmarks. Ministers adopted conclusions, which the Government broadly welcome, prolonging restrictive measures against certain officials until October 2010 while suspending the visa ban for the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/36"><I>Joint Session of EU Foreign and Defence Ministers</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/37"><I>Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH): Operation Althea</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/38">The presidency updated Ministers on the current EU/US &quot;Butmir&quot; initiative to increase the pace of reform in BiH, and said that the political situation was likely to remain tense throughout the current talks and the elections in autumn 2010. In this context, the presidency introduced a discussion of the future of EUFOR Operation Althea by setting out the options available. The presidency concluded that it was too early to take a decision, but that Ministers would return to the issue at the December GAERC. The Government continue to support the ongoing presence of EUFOR in BiH.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/39"><I>ESDP</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/40">Foreign and Defence Ministers agreed a declaration marking the tenth anniversary of ESDP and a wide-ranging set of conclusions, which the Government support, including on EUFOR Operation Althea, a possible Somalia training mission (see below), civilian capability development, and EU/NATO defence planning coherence.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/41"><I>Informal meeting with NATO Secretary-General</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/42">Foreign and Defence Ministers held an informal session with NATO Secretary-General Rasmussen, focusing on Afghanistan. Rasmussen stressed the need to focus on a gradual transfer of responsibility to the Afghans; to hold the new Afghan Government to account; and to increase European efforts to match those of the US.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/43"><I>Joint session of EU Foreign and Development Ministers</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/44"><I>Afghanistan and democracy support in EU external relations</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/45">The special representative of the UN Secretary-General, Kai Eide, took part in this session. Ministers highlighted Afghanistan as an example of the need for a more co-ordinated and coherent EU approach to democracy support for third countries, which the Government strongly support, using all available EU instruments. All member states agreed on the need to respect and build Afghan ownership for development and democracy building. Eide urged the EU not to impose solutions but to work towards Afghanistan's own priorities of agriculture and rural development, infrastructure and education.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/46">The UK emphasised the importance of involving regional players, and argued that the approach needed to be fully comprehensive so as to deliver security for the EU alongside benefits to the Afghan people.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/47"><I> Meeting of EU Defence Ministers</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/48">Defence Ministers, meeting in their capacity as the European Defence Agency (EDA) steering board, agreed: the EDA budget for 2010; the launch of a European helicopter training programme; a letter of intent on a European air transport fleet (which the UK and some other member states did not sign); and a declaration on a level playing field for the European defence equipment market, which the Government support. High Representative Solana also gave a report on EDA activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/49">Defence Ministers discussed Somalia during an informal meeting. Operation Commander Rear Admiral Hudson (Royal Navy) briefed on Operation Atalanta's continuing success against pirates, explaining that while there were still some successful attacks, the majority of the vessels affected had failed to follow best practice for self-protection. Ministers commended the operation. My noble friend Lady Taylor said that the UK remained committed to Atalanta and to providing the operation HQ for 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/50">High Representative Solana stressed the urgency of helping Somalia's transitional federal Government by training its security forces in close co-ordination with the African Union mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the US. The commission made clear its commitment to supporting a possible training mission with a contribution to costs. Some member states offered to contribute personnel and lead the mission. My noble friend Lady Taylor said there should be no illusions about the challenges of working in the region; before making a final decision on the mission, we needed the key questions to be properly answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/51">Ministers also had a general discussion of implementation of the ESDP-related provisions of the Lisbon treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/52"><I>Meeting of EU Development Ministers</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/53">The UK secured Development Ministers' support for our proposals for the commission to take on a strengthened role in monitoring official development assistance (ODA) performance and for the European Council to monitor EU ODA on a regular basis. The UK strongly emphasised the importance of additionality of climate finance over ODA, and secured agreement that Ministers would revert to this issue next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/54">Ministers also discussed how to achieve progress on the EU's commitments on aid effectiveness, and agreed an operational framework to that end in conclusions. Other items discussed were policy coherence for development, on which the Spanish presidency and Commission briefed on the forthcoming work programme; and budget support, on which Ministers discussed the need for a future dialogue on a co-ordinated EU approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/55"><I>&quot;A&quot; Points</I></p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/56">The Council adopted conclusions or decisions, without discussion, on: Council conclusions on an integrated maritime policy; Council conclusions on freedom of religion or belief; conclusions on democracy support; conclusions on policy coherence for development; a Council decision on conclusion of an agreement with Russia on exchange of classified information; conclusions on the use of EU battlegroups; conclusions forwarding the application by the Republic of Albania for membership of the European Union to the Commission for an avis; conclusions on Belarus highlighting prolongation of the restrictive measures in place against certain officials until October 2010 and suspension of the visa ban for the same period; draft Council guidelines for the European Defence Agency's work in 2010; and approval of the European Defence Agency budget.</p>

	Housing: Zero-carbon Buildings
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-24a.61.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="61"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91124-wms0009.htm#09112432001154">
	<p pid="a.61.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning (John Healey) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/2">The Government have recognised the serious global risks from climate change and have set in legislation a challenging target to reduce UK carbon emissions by 80 per cent against 1990 levels by 2050. Emissions from the way we heat, cool and power buildings are important in achieving this target: 17 per cent of UK emissions are from non-domestic buildings and 27 per cent from homes. The scale of the challenge means that we need to find ways of reducing emissions from all types of building as part of the UK's transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/3">I am today reaffirming the Government's commitment to the ambition for all new non-domestic buildings to be zero carbon from 2019, and publishing a consultation document that sets out policy principles and options for meeting this ambition. I am also setting out our plans for how new public sector buildings could lead the way, building on the work of a cross-departmental task force of government officials. We are seeking views on these options and their implications for viability for individual developments and sectors. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-26">26 February 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/4">This follows my Statement in July, when I confirmed the Government's policy that all new homes will be zero carbon from 2016 and announced further details on the definition and standards we will legislate for. One in three of Britain's homes in 2050 will be built between now and then. So today I am also providing an update on the definition and measurement of zero-carbon homes, following the report of a specialist task group.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/5"><I>Zero carbon non-domestic buildings</I></p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/6">In December 2008 we published a consultation on options to meet the definition of zero carbon, which included some initial thinking about what this could mean for non-domestic buildings. I am announcing today our more detailed proposals and the next steps needed to enable new commercial buildings to be zero carbon from 2019.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/7">We will adopt the broad framework for zero carbon that has been developed for homes, but adapted appropriately to reflect the differences in the non-domestic buildings market and the variation between non-domestic buildings. This means that, as supported by responses to the 2008 consultation, we will be using the threefold hierarchy of energy efficiency, followed by onsite or linked low and zero-carbon technologies (carbon compliance), followed by primarily offsite allowable solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/8">The policy will also reflect the important differences in non-domestic buildings, including the much wider variation in building types, locations, and uses, which can impact on both potential solutions and costs. We are therefore proposing that new non-domestic buildings should improve through an approach with differentiated targets to reflect the different potential different buildings have for energy efficiency and for onsite levels of carbon abatement. The consultation seeks views on this approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/9">Non-domestic buildings often have greater potential for onsite renewables (eg more roof space) and to play a central role in the viability of community heat or energy networks. We need to determine the extent to which we encourage use of these opportunities, and the consultation covers these questions. Onsite heat and energy generation will also be eligible for financial assistance under government incentive schemes for small-scale renewable generation, providing future income streams.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/10">Any carbon not mitigated onsite will be dealt with through a range of good quality allowable solutions. We are proposing that we will bring in some allowable solutions from 2016, alongside the approach for homes, and thus develop a single system for delivery and assurance. This early deployment could help to increase the volume and therefore viability of the allowable solutions market in its early years, and could increase the opportunities for non-domestic developments to contribute to community energy solutions. I have said that I will make a further announcement later about the allowable solutions that will be included.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/11">For non-domestic buildings, the variation in energy uses is considerably greater than for homes-reflecting the range of different uses for individual building types as well as the range of energy-intensity of different commercial activity. As a minimum, the zero-carbon standard for non-domestic buildings will include 100 per cent of energy uses currently covered by the building regulations (principally space heating, cooling and internal lighting). We are considering in addition a simplified way of accounting for ongoing energy use in the building (such as machinery, refrigeration, or computers), through requiring either 10 or 20 per cent extra improvement on top of regulated energy. The consultation seeks views on this and its potential impact on market viability.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/12">The public sector can play a significant role in supporting market development of low and zero-carbon buildings. We confirm our ambition from Budget 2008 that the public sector should aim to make the move to zero carbon for new non-domestic buildings by 2018, one year ahead of commercial buildings. The consultation sets out our proposals for a work programme to deliver this.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/13">I have placed a copy of the consultation document and the detailed impact assessment that accompanies it in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/14"><I>Zero carbon homes</I></p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/15">I announced in July that I would set up a specialist task group to examine the energy efficiency metrics and standards that should be part of zero-carbon homes, in order to realise our ambition for the highest practical energy efficiency level realisable in all dwelling types.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/16">Following an intensive period of analysis and wider involvement of industry, commercial and environmental bodies, the task group has now reported to me. I am grateful to the task group for its excellent work and am placing a copy of its report in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/17">The recommendations are for an energy standard that is measured as the amount of energy required to provide space heating and cooling. The proposed standard is 46 kilowatt-hours per square metre per year (kWh/m2/year) for semi-detached and detached homes and 39 kWh/m2/year for all other homes. The further details of what that means are set out in the task group's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/18">I am satisfied that the task group's recommendations strike the right balance between a high level of ambition and a standard that can be realised in practice by 2016. I therefore intend to use this standard within the definition of zero-carbon homes. I will be using our forthcoming consultation on updating the Code for Sustainable Homes to check that there are no unintended consequences from this standard and to seek views on the energy efficiency standard to be adopted in 2013. By aligning our approach to energy efficiency and zero carbon within the code, we will smooth the transition to zero-carbon homes in 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/19">The task group has made a number of additional recommendations for further research and modelling to support the proposed energy standard. I shall be taking these recommendations forward, in collaboration with the Zero Carbon Hub and other relevant research and industry bodies. One of the particular recommendations is that industry will need design guidance to support the standard. I recognise that industry will need such guidance and will work with industry to produce this.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/20">I can also announce that the Government-funded Technology Strategy Board is allocating &pound;3.2 million of funding to boost long-term research into how we design and build low carbon homes. The research will use new technologies and materials to provide valuable evidence for future standards and how to drive down energy bills. This funding is part of the Technology Strategy Board's &pound;50 million Low Impact Buildings Innovation Platform, which is being allocated to projects in the period to 2011. The money will be used by a consortium-including Barratt Developments, Crest Nicholson, Stewart-Milne, H + H Celcon, Oxford Brookes University and the Building Research Establishment-to build demonstration homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/21">These homes will be built without the use of on-site renewables so as to test just how far it is possible to go towards zero carbon through energy efficient fabric measures alone and the implications of doing so. Having designed and built the homes, they will be monitored to find out the energy savings that occupants realise in practice and to learn more about the occupants' experience of living in highly energy efficient homes. The lessons we learn from these homes will be valuable evidence to support the way that the zero-carbon homes of the future are built.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.1/2">I am announcing today that, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-14">14 December 2009</phrase>, employers wishing to recruit a migrant under tier 2 of the points-based system will first need to advertise to jobseekers in the UK for four weeks.

	<p pid="a.64.1/4">This change was proposed by the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) in their tier 2 report which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-19">19 August</phrase>, a copy of which can be found in the House Library. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-07">7 September</phrase> the Home Secretary announced that the Government have accepted the recommendations put forward in the report in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/5">The Prime Minister announced, in his speech on immigration on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-12">12 November</phrase>, that the strengthening of the resident labour market test would be introduced quickly, to better support resident workers looking for skilled jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/6">The flexibility of the points-based system allows us to support UK workers and at the same time meet the recruitment needs of businesses and to support the economy. In making this change, we are using that flexibility to support businesses in two ways:</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/7">First, we will only apply this change to advertising campaigns that start on or after <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-14">14 December</phrase>. Businesses that have already run advertisements will not need to do so again to meet the new requirement. Secondly, while we will require all jobs to be advertised for four weeks before a migrant worker can be appointed, we will not require the four weeks to be continuous. This will mean that businesses will not need to advertise all their vacancies for four weeks on the off-chance that no suitable resident workers apply and they need to recruit a migrant worker. For example, we will allow businesses to advertise skilled jobs for two weeks initially. If a suitable resident worker applies, the business can appoint them straight away. However, if no suitable resident workers apply, the resident labour market must be tested for a further two weeks before they can appoint a migrant worker.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/8">The other changes to tier 2 recommended by the MAC will be implemented in spring 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.1/1">My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Jack Straw) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">I wish to make the following Statement to the House regarding the commencement of party funding provisions of the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009. The Act received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-21">21 July 2009</phrase> and represents a significant step towards a system of party funding which is more transparent, better regulated and, most importantly, better able to win the confidence of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/3">The following provision will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-25">25 November 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/4">Section 21-Limitation of pre-candidacy election expenses for certain general elections. This provision introduces a new spending limit for candidates at certain general elections, to run from the date after 55 months of a Parliament have elapsed until the date an individual formally becomes a candidate (this is, in most cases, the date of dissolution of Parliament). Commencement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-25">25 November</phrase> means that, in the case of the present Parliament, the new spending limit will apply to election expenses incurred on or after <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-25">25 November</phrase> which are used on or after <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/5">The following provisions will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/6">Section 12-Defence to charge of failing to return donation from impermissible donor. This provision seeks to add clarity to the existing position in the 2000 Act, namely, that if a party treasurer is charged with an offence of accepting an impermissible donation, the party or party treasurer will not be guilty if they can show that they took all reasonable steps to verify that the donor was a permissible donor, and having done so, believed that was the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/7">Section 13-&quot;Reasonable excuse&quot; in relation to certain offences under the 2000 Act. This provision recasts certain offences in the 2000 Act (mainly relating to requirements imposed by that Act to report various matters to the Electoral Commission) so that they may be committed only if something is done or not done &quot;without reasonable excuse&quot;. The provision also removes existing defences to the offences in question, in consequence of this new qualification to the acts or omissions that may constitute an offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/8">Section 14-Control of donations to members associations: responsible persons. These provisions require that members' associations in receipt of a reportable permissible donation (a transaction in excess of &pound;7,500) or an impermissible recordable donation (above &pound;500), appoint a responsible person where they do not have a treasurer.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/9">Section 15-Control of donations to holders of elective office-compliance officers. These provisions are intended to alleviate some of the burden of complying with reporting procedures by allowing (but not requiring) holders of elective office<sup>1</sup> to appoint a compliance officer to assist with the duties of reporting and verifying donations and loans. The provisions do not absolve an office-holder who chooses to appoint such an officer of guilt for a failure to comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/10">Section 16-Control of loans to members associations: responsible persons. This provision achieves the same effect as Section 14, in relation to loans and related transactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/11">Section 17-Control of loans to holders of elective office-compliance officers. This provision achieves the same effect as Section 15, in relation to loans and related transactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/12">Section 18-Person may not be &quot;responsible person&quot; for more than one recognised third party. A recognised third party is an organisation that spends more than &pound;10,000 on campaigning at an election and registers with the Electoral Commission as a result. This section provides that persons responsible for ensuring compliance with the reporting requirements for expenditure to which recognised third parties are subject, as set out in the 2000 Act, may not discharge these responsibilities with respect to more than one recognised third party.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/13">Section 20-Increased thresholds in relation to donations etc. This section increases to more than &pound;500 the threshold above which donations received and loans entered into must be recorded under the 2000 Act. Additionally the thresholds above which donations and loans must be reported to the Electoral Commission are increased to more than &pound;1,500 (for individuals and accounting units) and to more than &pound;7,500 (for registered parties, members associations, recognised third parties and permitted participants).</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/14">We are committed to implementing the Act in a timely and appropriate manner, taking account of good regulatory practice and the desirability of early commencement. We have been engaging with the political parties, the Electoral Commission and other government departments to ensure that the commencement programme for the Act is timely and effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/15">Subject to approval by both Houses where necessary, the following provisions will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-01">1 July</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/16">Section 1(2)-Compliance with controls imposed by the 2000 Act etc. This provision amends Section 145 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 by clarifying that the function of the Electoral Commission is to regulate, as well as monitor, compliance with that Act. In its capacity as regulator, the commission shall take such steps as it considers appropriate to secure compliance with those requirements. The commission will publish guidance as to what conduct will satisfy the requirements of the 2000 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/17">Section 2 (and Schedule 1)-Investigatory powers of the commission. These provisions give effect to new schedule 19B to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 which provides the commission with powers to enable them to require access to information for certain purposes and to fulfil their function as an effective regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/18">Section 3 (and Schedule 2)-Civil Sanctions. These provisions insert new schedule 19C to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. They give the Electoral Commission new powers to apply a range of civil sanctions to offences and contraventions under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (as amended by the Political Parties and Elections Act and the Electoral Administration Act 2006). The new flexible civil sanctions provide alternatives to referral for criminal prosecution under the 2000 Act, allowing the Electoral Commission to apply sanctions that are appropriate to the nature of each contravention. The Commission will also be able to use new approaches to secure compliance with the law where appropriate, rather than imposing a traditional penalty such as a fine, or referring a case for criminal investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/19">Section 8-Education about systems of government and EU institutions. This provision restricts the Electoral Commission's educational role to promoting awareness of current and pending electoral systems in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/20">The following provisions will be not be commenced before the summer of 2010:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/21">Section 9-Declaration as to source of donation; Section 10-Non-resident donors; Section 11-Non-resident lenders. Officials have begun preliminary work on the prerequisites to implementation of these provisions. However, as I stated during consideration of Lords Amendments to the Bill, we are practically unable to commence Sections 10 and 11 before the summer of 2010 due to their complex nature. Section 9, which requires donors to provide declarations as to the true origins of all donations of over &pound;7,500, will be commenced alongside Sections 10 and 11 to ensure consistency in approach, which will be welcomed by those who make political donations, as well as parties and other recipients who will have to ensure that they comply with the additional declaration requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/22"><sup>1</sup> For the purposes of Schedule 7 (reporting of donations), the relevant elective offices are: member of the House of Commons; member of the European Parliament elected in the United Kingdom; member of the Scottish Parliament; member of the National Assembly for Wales; member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, member of any local authority in the United Kingdom (including the Common Council of the City of London but excluding a parish or community council); a member of the Greater London Assembly; and the Mayor of London or other elected mayor. For the purposes of Schedule 7A (reporting of loans) the list of relevant elective offices is the same, with the exception of independent members of the Scottish Parliament and independent members of Scottish local authorities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2009-11-24a.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100072" speakername="Lord Brett" colon=":" colnum="73"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91124-wms0011.htm#09112432001381">
	<p pid="a.73.1/1">My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">I would like to update the House on the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka. Six months ago, the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka created almost 280,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). I visited Sri Lanka in early October and advocated for freedom of movement for the IDP population who continue to be held in closed camps. At the time of my visit, this population numbered almost 253,000 people. I would like to reiterate that meeting the humanitarian needs of the IDPs remains the most immediate priority for the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3">I welcome the recent announcement by the Government of Sri Lanka of their intention that all IDPs will have total freedom of movement from <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December</phrase> in the camps in Sri Lanka. It will be important that humanitarian agencies have access to fully meet the needs of the IDPs who choose to remain in the camps until they can return to their homes or go to host families. Approximately 130,000 IDPs still remain in these camps. Conditions remain basic but have improved since the separate visits to Sri Lanka earlier this year by the Foreign Secretary, a cross-party group of MPs led by Des Browne as well as my own previous visits in April and October. The monsoon has now started and it is raining heavily. Many of the temporary shelters are deteriorating and there is a risk that flooding will occur. With freedom of movement then it would be much more acceptable for humanitarian agencies to be able to improve conditions in the camps and support any moves to make them genuine welfare villages.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">I also join with the UN to welcome the recent progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka over the past four weeks in returning the IDPs from the closed camps in Vavuniya to their home areas. As of <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November</phrase>, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that over 132,000 IDPs have now either returned to their home areas or have been released to institutions or host families elsewhere. The majority of those returning to their homes have been to Jaffna. Returns are now starting to other areas in the Vanni such as Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">However, I also have concerns. The pace of returns is increasingly limited by the challenge of ensuring that areas are free from land mines and unexploded ordnance. I am pleased that we are helping to meet this challenge by funding the work of two British demining NGOs-the HALO Trust and Mine Action Group-to help make areas safe again. A further concern is that not all returnees enjoy unrestricted freedom of movement outside of their immediate home areas. Moreover, in some areas where the IDPs have been able to return home, humanitarian access for agencies to assist them is still restricted. This is making it unnecessarily hard to meet the basic needs of returning IDPs. I urge the Government of Sri Lanka to co-operate fully with all concerned humanitarian agencies so that they can undertake their usual assistance and protection activities, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/6">DfID continues to support the relief effort to Sri Lanka as the situation on the ground allows. Since September 2008, we have committed &pound;12.5 million. Last week, I approved a further &pound;1 million from this budget to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to support the safe and dignified return of IDPs to their home areas. This grant will help provide transport, emergency shelters, temporary health clinics, immediate access to high-quality water and sanitation facilities and livelihoods support for the returning IDP population. It will also allow IOM to extend its existing IDP registration programme to all IDPs. This registration programme was originally supported by DfID in April and is an essential part of enabling returning IDPs to access basic services.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/7">We have always made it clear that the IDP camps should not be anything other than temporary in nature. During my recent visit, I confirmed that once the critical monsoon season is over DfID will only fund life-saving emergency interventions in the existing closed camps. The focus of our funding will shift further towards early recovery activities in the area of demining, support to the returns process and livelihood recovery. Once again, I would like to reassure the House that all DfID funding is provided directly to neutral and impartial international agencies. &pound;2.87 million remains to be committed as the situation on the ground allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/8">Looking forward, we recognise the progress that the Government of Sri Lanka have made towards their own original target of returning 80 per cent of the IDPs to their areas of origin by the end of the year. After 26 years of intermittent conflict, there remain an additional 214,000 long-term displaced people to consider who may now also wish to return to their home areas. It is important that the Government of Sri Lanka address the needs of all IDPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/9">Our other priority since the end of the conflict has been to urge the Government to make a concerted effort to secure lasting peace by working for genuine reconciliation between Sri Lanka's communities. Our view remains that this can only be achieved through a fully inclusive political settlement that addresses the legitimate grievance and aspirations of all communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/10">The British Government continue to engage fully with the Government of Sri Lanka as well as international and multilateral partners. The Foreign Secretary discussed these issues with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister when they last spoke on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-04">4 November</phrase>. Our High Commissioner to Sri Lanka regularly raises our concerns with senior members of the Sri Lankan Government. The UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, Sir John Holmes, visited Sri Lanka on 17 to <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-19">19 November</phrase> and concluded that returns must be both voluntary and informed. He also welcomed the Government of Sri Lanka's assurance regarding their commitment to ensuring full freedom of movement for IDPs. I spoke to Sir John Holmes yesterday about the humanitarian situation going forwards and the international response and reiterated the UK priority of freedom of movement for the IDP population. I also welcomed the progress that has been made to date by the Government of Sri Lanka in returning the IDPs from the camps to their homes.</p>

	Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat): Capital End of Year Flexibility Draw Down

	<p pid="a.75.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Marine and Natural Environment (Huw Irranca-Davies) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/2">Subject to parliamentary approval of HM Treasury agreement to capital end of year flexibility draw down in 2009-10, the capital element of DEL (CDEL) will increase by &pound;80,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/3">Resource DEL (RDEL) remains at &pound;1,000, representing the &quot;token vote&quot;; no additional cash requirement is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/4">The impact on resources and capital is set out in the following table:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="a.75.1/15"> <td>Total</td> <td>80</td> <td>292</td> <td>0</td> <td>292</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.75.1/18">* Depreciation, which forms part of resource DEL, is excluded from the total DEL since capital DEL includes capital spending and to include depreciation of those assets would lead to double counting.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/19">** Capital DEL includes items treated as resource in estimates and accounts but which are treated as capital DEL in budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/20">*** The total of the &quot;administration budget&quot; and &quot;near cash in resource DEL&quot; figures may well be greater than total Resource DEL, due to the definitions overlapping.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/21">Changes in Capital DEL (CDEL)</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/22">The change in the capital element of DEL of &pound;80,000 arises in a claim on capital end of year flexibility to cover the cost of Phase 2 of the new telephone switch system.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.1/3">In recent years much has been achieved to increase protection for women and to prosecute their attackers. However, the strategy will be the first comprehensive, co-ordinated effort to tackle this form of gender-based violence, integrating work from across government under the headings of prevention, provision and protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/4">The Government recognise that the complexity of this issue demands not only a firm criminal justice response, but focussed measures to stop violence from happening in the first place while ensuring that appropriate help and support for women and girls is available to those who need it. To deliver these commitments we will continue to work closely with local partners to achieve our goal of ending violence against women.</p>
