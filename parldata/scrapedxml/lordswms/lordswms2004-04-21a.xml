	<p pid="a.13.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/2">I am pleased to announce that the Northern Ireland Discretionary Social Fund budget for 2004&ndash;05 will be &pound;58.25 million: &pound;12.64 million will be allocated to grants; &pound;45.51 million to loans and &pound;0.1 million will be held as a contingency reserve. The new allocations represent an increase of &pound;l.65 million over the initial gross budget set at April 2004. This increase will be funded through higher loan recoveries, plus an increase in net Treasury funding of &pound;0.94 million for this year. This &pound;0.94 million is the second of three annual increases from a &pound;8.2 million boost for the Discretionary Social Fund announced in the autumn 2002 Pre-Budget Report.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/3">The Community Care Grant budget has been increased by &pound;0.94 million to &pound;12.64 million. This will provide more help to customers, in particular families with children and the disabled.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/4">The loans budget has been increased to &pound;45.51 million, an increase of &pound;0.71 million on the initial 2003&ndash;04 loans budget. To improve the fairness of the scheme, budgets will be allocated in a way that will over time achieve greater consistency of outcome for customers wherever they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.3/5">Details of the budget allocations, together with a note explaining the basis on which they have been made, have been placed in the House of Commons Library today.</p>
