<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-01a.9.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="9"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51101-38.htm#51101-38_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.9.1/1">My right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Margaret Beckett) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/2">In my oral Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">Wednesday 26 October</phrase> I said that the Chief Veterinary Officer and I had ordered a general review of our quarantine arrangements and procedures to be undertaken. I am pleased to announce today that Professor Nigel Dimmock, Emeritus Professor of Virology at Warwick University has agreed to chair the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/3">The terms of reference for the review are:</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/4" class="indent">to review avian quarantine arrangements and procedures for captive birds; and</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/5" class="indent">to make recommendations on any changes needed to policies or procedures, including guidance, to improve biosecurity, compliance with relevant legislation and clarity of accountabilities</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/6">The review will be led by Professor Dimmock and the membership will be drawn from independent experts in a range of fields including virology, logistics, veterinary science and animal behaviour. The review team will examine the current arrangements for the quarantine of captive birds; they will be able to talk to practitioners and experts in the field as well as examining existing guidance and procedures. They may also want to visit quarantine premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/7">Debby Reynolds, the Chief Vet, and I have asked Professor Dimmock to report his findings as speedily as possible. We hope to receive his report, which we will publish, within around one month.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/8">I am most grateful to Professor Dimmock for taking on this important task. The advice of his expert review team will enable us to ensure that our avian quarantine arrangements are as up to date and effective as they can be in the face of the significant challenges we face from the rapid worldwide spread of highly pathogenic zoonotic disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Caroline Flint) made the following Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="">28 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/2">The Agriculture and Fisheries Council of the European Union met on 24&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase> and voted on a proposal to authorise food ingredients derived from the genetically modified maize line MON863. As the vote did not result in the necessary majority either for or against the proposal, the regulatory committee procedure for implementing powers requires that the proposal is passed back to the European Commission to adopt the implementing act.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.3/3">The Government regret that it was necessary to vote on this authorisation, through a scrutiny override, before parliamentary scrutiny has been completed and before the debate recommended by the European Scrutiny Committee. The United Kingdom had previously supported this authorisation because there was adequate evidence that the necessary criteria for authorisation&mdash;namely; safety, consumer information and nutritional quality&mdash;had been met. In the absence of a clear majority among member states at that stage, the decision was later referred to the Council with a deadline of three months for a further vote. It is unfortunate that this period coincided with the Summer Recess and it was therefore not possible to complete the scrutiny process before the vote. I wrote to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">20 October</phrase> setting out this position. The Government are, none the less, fully committed to the need for national Parliaments to have proper oversight of EU issues and the subject of the authorisation of food ingredients from MON863 maize will be debated in European Standing Committee in due course.</p>
