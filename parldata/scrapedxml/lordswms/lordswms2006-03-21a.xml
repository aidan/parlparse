	<p pid="a.25.0/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Don Touhig) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/2">The <i>Stewardship Report on the Defence Estate 2005</i> will be published today. The publication of the report implements the commitment in the defence estate strategy <i>In Trust &amp; On Trust</i> to report annually performance across a range of estate-related objectives, and to demonstrate that the department is discharging its obligations properly and acting responsibly in meeting the needs of the Armed Forces. The report attempts to balance:</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/3" class="indent">describing the substantial investment made in the estate, the successes over the year, the other steps being taken to improve the effectiveness of management and the achievement of value for money, with</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/4" class="indent">the commitment to provide an account of our stewardship to external stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/5">The report is similar to previous ones in that it sets out the progress against the aims and objectives in the defence estate strategy and demonstrates how the estate is changing as a result. Copies will be made available in the Library; it will also be available via the MoD website at <a href="http://www.mod.uk">www.mod.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.3/2">With the introduction of a new tax regime for pensions from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> of this year, it will be necessary for pension schemes to be registered with HM Customs and Revenue before receiving tax privileges. As a result of the discrete way in which the current pension scheme for the Police Service of Northern Ireland was established, the scheme will be registered separately from the scheme for officers serving in home forces in Great Britain. To coincide with the tax changes, three new police pension schemes are being introduced from April 2006. As a result, officers transferring between Northern Ireland and Great Britain on or after <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> would not be able to remain in the current pension scheme arrangements as these will be closed to new members from that date. As matters now stand, officers wishing to continue to contribute to a police pension would be obliged to move into one of the new schemes on transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.3/3">In view of the need to ensure that currently serving police officers can continue to move between the PSNI and GB police forces as at present, the Government, in consultation with Scottish Ministers, have decided that the current police pension schemes across the United Kingdom should be unified. I therefore intend to seek parliamentary approval to amend the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 and the Police Pensions Act 1976 to allow the pension schemes to be formally merged. This will allow officers serving at present who transfer on or after <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> to remain in the current pension scheme on permanent transfer, should they so wish. This will apply to police officers serving in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland who are members of the current pension scheme on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.3/4">Later this year serving officers will have the opportunity to move across to a new police pension scheme. Today's announcement is to clarify the position for those officers who might not wish to join a new police pension scheme, but who may wish to apply for posts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to gain experience or promotion.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.3/5">After the current pension schemes in Northern Ireland and Great Britain have been merged, police officers in post before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> would be able to transfer from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, and vice versa, without having to move into the new pension arrangements. However, as the parliamentary process necessary to merge the schemes will take some time, the Government propose that officers transferring between the PSNI and GB forces in the interim will be able to do so under conditions which enable them to remain in the current arrangements. It is envisaged that these interim transfer conditions will last up to three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/2">Further to my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase>, I should like to make a Statement to report progress on the review of police force structures in the Yorkshire and the Humber region.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/3">My Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase> set out the way forward for the East Midlands, South East and Eastern regions. This followed similar Statements on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-06">6 February</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-03">3 March</phrase>, which set out the way forward for Wales and three English regions: the North East, the North West and the West Midlands. I now have the professional policing and financial assessments to enable me to identify which option will be of the greatest benefit to the Yorkshire and the Humber region. I am therefore today meeting the representatives from the police forces and authorities in this area and, as with the other force and authorities, I will be inviting them to engage closely with me to consider taking forward the option for policing which I believe will be of greatest benefit to their communities. I will be inviting the police authorities concerned to respond by <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-07">7 April</phrase> and I shall then make a final decision on how to proceed in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/4">I shall make a further report to the House about the way forward for forces in the South West in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/5">Options proposed at this stage as suitable for progression:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/6">Yorkshire and the Humber</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/7">Merger of Humberside, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire</p>
