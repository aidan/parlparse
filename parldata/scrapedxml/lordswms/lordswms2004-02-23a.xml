	Senior Salaries Review Body
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-02-23a.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040223/text/40223-39.htm#40223-39_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.1.1/1">The 26th Report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which makes recommendations about the pay of the senior Civil Service, senior military personnel and the judiciary, is being published today. Copies are in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. The Prime Minister is grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">The main recommendations of the review body for the senior Civil Service are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> of 2 per cent to the pay ranges for each of the senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/4">a range of base pay awards from 0 to 9 per cent depending on performance;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/5">a minimum unconsolidated bonus payment of 3 per cent or &pound;2,500, whichever is the higher, for those making the greatest contribution; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/6">an uplift to the pay range for Permanent Secretaries resulting in a new range of &pound;121,100 to &pound;256,550; the uplift is broadly equivalent to the increase proposed to the pay ranges for the senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/7">The main recommendation of the review body for the senior military is an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> of 2.8 per cent in the value of all points on the incremental pay scales for senior military officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/8">The main recommendation of the review body for the judiciary is an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> of 2.5 per cent in judicial salaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/9">The Government have decided to accept these recommendations. Their cost will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/10">The review body has also recommended that broad salary linkage between its remit groups should be achieved from now on by maintaining general equivalence in salary levels at the top of the structures only. The Government will be considering this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/11">Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the increase in pay bands for the senior Civil Service. Their pay entitlement will therefore increase by 2 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.5/1">The post-consultation report for the paper <i>Courts Boards: constitution and procedures </i>is published today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">Courts boards will be a means of ensuring local involvement in the way in which courts are run. They will work with the new unified courts agency, which will integrate the management of the courts within a single agency to replace the magistrates' courts committees and the Court Service. Courts boards will provide a vital local input, to ensure that the courts administration is run in a way that meets the needs of their areas. We intend to appoint the first members to courts boards towards the end of 2004, so that the boards will run in shadow form before the new agency is launched in April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3">The consultation paper <i>Courts Boards: constitution and procedures </i>sought views on how appointments should be made to courts boards and the procedures by which they should operate. The consultation period ran from <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-25">25 September 2003</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-05">5 January 2004</phrase> and 141 responses were received.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/4">A post-consultation report for the paper <i>Courts Boards: constitution and procedures </i>will be published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-26">26 February</phrase>. The report will set out the Government's decisions on how courts boards will be set up, in the light of the responses received to consultation. It will also inform regulations which will be laid before Parliament on that day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/5">I am keen for courts boards to be set up in shadow form during this year so that the boards may then consider the draft business plans for the first year of the new unified courts agency.</p>
