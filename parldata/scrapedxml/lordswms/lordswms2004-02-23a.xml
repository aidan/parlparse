	<p pid="a.1.1/1">The 26th Report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which makes recommendations about the pay of the senior Civil Service, senior military personnel and the judiciary, is being published today. Copies are in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. The Prime Minister is grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">The main recommendations of the review body for the senior Civil Service are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3">an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> of 2 per cent to the pay ranges for each of the senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/4">a range of base pay awards from 0 to 9 per cent depending on performance;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/5">a minimum unconsolidated bonus payment of 3 per cent or &pound;2,500, whichever is the higher, for those making the greatest contribution; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/6">an uplift to the pay range for Permanent Secretaries resulting in a new range of &pound;121,100 to &pound;256,550; the uplift is broadly equivalent to the increase proposed to the pay ranges for the senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/7">The main recommendation of the review body for the senior military is an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> of 2.8 per cent in the value of all points on the incremental pay scales for senior military officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/8">The main recommendation of the review body for the judiciary is an increase from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> of 2.5 per cent in judicial salaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/9">The Government have decided to accept these recommendations. Their cost will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/10">The review body has also recommended that broad salary linkage between its remit groups should be achieved from now on by maintaining general equivalence in salary levels at the top of the structures only. The Government will be considering this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/11">Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the increase in pay bands for the senior Civil Service. Their pay entitlement will therefore increase by 2 per cent from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>

	Iraq: Interim Country Assistance Plan
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-02-23a.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040223/text/40223-39.htm#40223-39_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.1.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/2">I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of DfID's Interim Country Assistance Plan for Iraq. It sets out how DfID aims to contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq in the period up to March 2006. I have also decided to make an initial contribution of &pound;65 million (120 million US dollars) to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, managed by the World Bank and United Nations, out of the resources pledged by the United Kingdom for the reconstruction of Iraq at the Madrid donors conference in October 2003 (see my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-14">14 October 2003</phrase>: Cols. 9&ndash;10WS).</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/3">Saddam Hussein's tyranny led to a significant increase in poverty and Iraq was isolated from the rest of the world, including its own region, for much of his rule. In many respects Iraq's social and economic indicators now resemble those of a low-income country rather than a major oil producer. But Iraq's abundant human and natural resources offer the potential for a rapid return to relative prosperity, if the right conditions are created in the short and medium term.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/4">Against this background, DfID's objectives for the next two years are to support: rapid, sustainable and equitable economic growth; effective and accountable governance; and social and political cohesion and stability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/5">To work towards these goals DfID will focus on three levels:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/6">Internationally: by supporting the United Nations and World Bank International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI), assisting the Ministry of Planning and Development Co-operation, and continuing dialogue with other donors on the coordination and effectiveness of assistance to Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/7">Nationally: by funding projects which benefit the poor, promote an inclusive political process and economic reform, and strengthen public administration. Examples include: helping the growth of small and medium-sized businesses; setting up a fund to support the participation of citizens, parties and interest groups in the political process; and technical assistance to Iraq's public administration system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/8">In southern Iraq: by funding projects to reduce poverty and helping to restore the area's administrative and political links with Baghdad so that it can benefit from Iraq's national development efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/9">At the Madrid donors conference, the United Kingdom pledged a total of &pound;544 million for the period from April 2003 to March 2006, a significant proportion of which would be channelled through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). The allocation of our initial contribution between the UN and the World Bank Trust Funds will be decided shortly. Any further DfID contributions to the funds will be considered in the light of the effectiveness of their operations and their need for additional funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/10">A total of over 32 billion dollars was pledged to Iraq at the Madrid conference. These pledges, together with a substantial reduction in Iraq's debt which should be negotiated this year, will provide a sound basis for the country's initial reconstruction. If the right steps are taken now, and the political situation in the country is stabilised, much of Iraq's longer-term investment needs should be met by commercial loans, foreign direct investment and its own resources. Iraq's human capital, and its oil reserves of about 2,500 billion dollars at current prices, should enable it to meet its future needs without significant external grant assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/11">The country assistance plan is also available on the DfID website: <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>.</p>

The AFPRB has also recommended increases in the rates of specialist pay (for example, flying pay, submarine pay, diving pay and hydrographic pay), and in accommodation charges. The AFPRB has also recommended a 3.2 per cent increase to rates of longer separated service allowance and longer service at sea bonus which are designed to compensate for separation.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/4">The additional cost to the defence budget will be &pound;196 million. This will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/5">The AFPRB's recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>

They will work with the new unified courts agency, which will integrate the management of the courts within a single agency to replace the magistrates' courts committees and the Court Service. Courts boards will provide a vital local input, to ensure that the courts administration is run in a way that meets the needs of their areas.

It will also inform regulations which will be laid before Parliament on that day.</p>
