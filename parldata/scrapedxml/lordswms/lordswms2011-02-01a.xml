	<p pid="a.69.1/2">Today the Government are publishing the first group of reports presenting the findings from research projects commissioned by the previous Administration.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.1/4">The reports and findings are of general policy interest, but do not relate to forthcoming policy announcements. We are publishing these documents in the interests of transparency and as part of our freedom of information commitment to publish the results of all commissioned research. For transparency, all completed work is being published regardless of format or robustness.</p>

	Foreign and Commonwealth Office: Expenditure
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2011-02-01a.71.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100308" speakername="Lord Howell of Guildford" colon=":" colnum="71"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110201-wms0001.htm#11020129000031">
	<p pid="a.71.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (William Hague) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2">In my Statement to the House of <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-29">29 June 2010</phrase>, I informed the House of the outcome of my review of how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will spend its programme funding in this financial year. I am now in a position to announce decisions about programme spending for the next financial year 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/3">The Foreign Office's priorities are to safeguard Britain's national security, build British prosperity and support British nationals around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/4">The review we have conducted will ensure that FCO programme spending is aligned with our priorities and contributes to the development of Britain's diplomatic influence and the promotion of our values. We must ensure the money is spent effectively and supports the Government's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GNI as official development assistance (ODA) by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/5">As a result of the review the FCO will change the way it manages its programme spending. We will give British ambassadors greater responsibility for deciding how best to spend their local budgets to support UK foreign policy objectives and strengthen bilateral relationships. We will reduce administrative spending and seek other cost savings. We will introduce new procedures to assess the impact of FCO programme spending worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/6">For the 2011-12 financial year, we have decided to allocate:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/7">&#163;57 million for programmes dedicated to national security;&#163;24 million for programmes to support UK prosperity, including through the promotion of a stable and open global economic environment which will help countries develop; and&#163;58.5 million for the support of democratic values, human rights and British diplomatic influence overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/8">This is a total of &#163;139.5 million. I anticipate that in future years it will be necessary to make some reductions in these allocations in order to be able to continue to support our diplomatic network overseas, while achieving the savings we committed to making during the comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/9">Within the overall allocations set out above we have made a number of significant decisions on funding for individual programmes next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/10">On security, we will sustain spending on counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation at &#163;38 million and &#163;3 million respectively. We will provide &#163;16 million for spending on counter-narcotics and rule of law programmes in Afghanistan. This represents a reduction of &#163;2 million, which will be made possible without affecting the outcomes of our projects there, as several of them will reach the end of their capital investment stage. We will incorporate future spending on drugs and crime projects into the bilateral programmes managed by posts overseas, while provide a total of &#163;2 million as a ring-fenced element within those budgets to be dedicated to projects on drugs and crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/11">We will significantly increase spending on programmes to help countries develop and to support UK prosperity, bringing these to a total of &#163;20 million. We will spend more on projects which promote openness, international trade and investment, transparent and stable regulatory environments and strengthen the multilateral trading system and international investment opportunities, while resisting protectionism, including creating a commercial diplomacy fund of &#163;4 million dedicated to identifying and securing commercial opportunities for our businesses, and supporting inward investment to the UK. We will maintain current levels of spending on our successful programme which promotes the global transition to a low carbon economy, energy efficiency and security, and is intended to increase the prospects of reaching a global climate change agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/12">In terms of the promotion of our diplomatic influence and values, we will increase funding for bilateral programmes to &#163;19 million, including a ring-fenced allocation for the western Balkans and other non-EU countries in Europe. We will establish a new fund of &#163;5 million to address, in partnership with regional governments, the long-term underlying governance and social, economic and political participation issues affecting the Arab world. We will increase spending in the support of the Overseas Territories to &#163;7 million. We will sustain our spending on human rights and democracy at &#163;5 million. We will slightly increase spending in support of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy to &#163;3.5 million. We will dedicate &#163;17 million to spending on scholarships while at the same time ensuring a greater proportion of that spending is in Commonwealth countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/13">We will reduce spending on strategic communications by one third to &#163;2 million, targeting spending on activities and initiatives which actively support FCO priorities, and spend a greater proportion of this funding in posts overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/14">I will provide the House with details of programme spending for future years in due course together with further information about how we will ensure that these funds provide the best possible value for the public money.</p>

	Housing: Council Houses
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2011-02-01a.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100269" speakername="Baroness Hanham" colon=":" colnum="73"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110201-wms0001.htm#11020129000044">
	<p pid="a.73.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government (Grant Shapps) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">Today signals a landmark in the freeing up of councils to successfully manage their own housing stock for the benefit of their tenants-a change that has long been talked about, but the coalition Government are actually delivering.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3">Today we are publishing the information councils need to plan for this significant reform-reforms which will see councils keep their own rents and spend them on their own housing. This includes a detailed description as to how their opening financial position will be determined and the process for implementing these reforms in April 2012. It also gives each local authority a much clearer idea as to exactly how they will be affected by the reforms. This will enable them to use the next 14 months to plan ahead and put themselves in the best possible position to maximise the benefits of the new freedoms. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">In line with the Government's emphasis on transparency, local authorities and tenants will be able to see how and why the valuation has altered since the proposals published in March 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">Our proposals for self-financing for council housing will:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/6">give councils the resources they need to manage their own housing stock for the long-term-correcting decades of under-funding; give councils the incentives and flexibility they have sought to drive up quality and efficiency; and give tenants the information they need to hold their landlord to account-replacing the current opaque, centralised system with one which establishes a clear relationship between the rent councils charge and the services they provide</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/7">These reforms are fair. They are rooted in a consistent and tested calculation of the value of each council's social housing business, producing a sustainable self-financing settlement for each local authority. I expect all councils to welcome the reforms and to start planning now how to make the most of their new freedom.</p>
