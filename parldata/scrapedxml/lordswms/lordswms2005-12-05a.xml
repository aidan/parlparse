	EU Budget
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-12-05a.43.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="43"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51205-44.htm#51205-44_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.43.1/1">As presidency of the European Union, Her Majesty's Government are today circulating to all member states of the European Union for discussion comprehensive proposals for the European Union budget in the next financial period 2007&ndash;13 inclusive. Copies of the proposal are available in the Library of the House and in the Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/2">This Written Ministerial Statement outlines the context of the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/3">These budget proposals have four policy objectives:</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/4" class="indent">The first is tough budget discipline. They are below the level proposed by the Luxembourg presidency in June and 17 per cent below the level proposed by the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/5" class="indent">Secondly, they help the new member states in the enlarged EU by building their economies and societies, and they more fairly distribute the costs among the better-off nations. The UK is offering an extra contribution to these costs of enlargement amounting to &euro;8 billion over the budget period.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/6" class="indent">Thirdly, these proposals keep the rebate. Indeed, the rebate will rise from an annual average over recent years of &euro;5 billion to around 7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/7" class="indent">Fourthly, these proposals ensure there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy. All spending, including on agriculture, will be subject to a review during the coming budget period.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/8">Let me explain in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/9" class="italic">The budget overall</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/10">Last year the Commission proposed a budget of &euro;1,025 billion, or 1.24 per cent of the total national income of all member states (&quot;GNI&quot;). We said all along that this was far too high. There would be no chance of any serious budgetary reform in specific areas without strong downward pressure overall. Given this, and the demand of the six &quot;budget disciplinarians&quot; (France, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Netherlands and UK), the Luxembourg presidency reduced its proposed budget to 1.06 per cent, or &euro;871 billion. This latest proposal would further reduce the budget to &euro;847 billion (or 1.03 per cent on the commitments basis) and by the end of the budget period spending will be below the 1 per cent level the six had proposed. This would be a major achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/11">It is important to see these proposals in a longer-term context. EU spending hit 1 per cent of GNI in 1985 and rose rapidly under Baroness Thatcher and Sir John Major as a proportion of national income, by a quarter to 1.25 per cent by the early 1990s. And it started to come down only in 1998. These proposals would bring it down further.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/12" class="italic">Enlargement</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/13">The new member states will receive &euro;150 billion in structural and cohesion funding. That is an enormous amount and would represent very large new funds. Total funding through all EU programmes to the 10 new member states is worth twice the Marshall Plan which funded the reconstruction of Western Europe nearly 60 years ago (*at today's prices).</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/14">And we are ensuring that these countries will be able to spend much more of what they have been allocated. This is a very important point because the record shows that year by year both the existing and new member states have not been able to spend their full allocation for many technical reasons. We have included a series of very practical changes to ensure that they are better able to do so. This means that while headline entitlements are lower by &euro;14 billion than in the June proposals, we are confident that all these countries will be better able to spend what they have been allocated. And we are proposing strengthened financial management arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/15">Under our proposals, for example, Hungary would receive &euro;22 billion in structural and cohesion funding the Czech Republic &euro;23 billion and Poland &euro;56 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/16">Of course there are those who ask why our taxpayers in western Europe should pay for roads, railways and other reconstruction projects in the east. The answer is that all enlargements have benefited all members economically by increasing the total volume of EU trade, investment and jobs in which all have a share. British trade with the new member states has already increased by 400 per cent since 1990, ten times the rate of growth with the rest of the world. That is an indication of the economic potential we will be helping to unlock by making this investment in Europe's future. It is very much in Britain's national interest for the world's largest single market to grow and become more prosperous. And the benefits of enlargement are not just economic. It must be in Britain's interest to have increasingly stable societies in eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/17" class="italic">The UK contribution</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/18">As I have spelt out, and as these proposals make clear, the UK Government recognise their responsibility to pay a fair contribution to the cost of enlargement&mdash;an historic project supported across the political divide. It has been a strategic objective of successive British governments and, happily, has enjoyed very active all-party support. The opposition parties have called for significant increases in structural and cohesion funding in central and eastern Europe. This budget delivers that objective. But it has to be paid for. We are all prepared to pay our fair share, but no more than our fair share.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/19">As EU spending shifts from older member states to the new, the British contribution will inevitably rise, along with the contributions of all the EU 15 member states. But the proposals tabled by the Luxembourg presidency would have left us with a bill of more than &euro;20 billion over and above the &euro;50 billion that would be our contribution under existing arrangements. That was not acceptable then, nor is it now. The proposal we have tabled today will take our contribution to &euro;58 billion over the seven-year period of the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/20">This is the equivalent of halving the value of the rebate in respect of structural and cohesion funding in the ten new member states. This could be achieved either by not applying the rebate to a proportion of structural and cohesion funding in the new member states, or by a technical route to increasing our gross contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/21">The UK will in any event continue to receive the full value of the rebate as it applies to the Europe of 15, and to all CAP spending throughout the union. And the rebate will rise, because it increases in proportion to our net contribution. The rebate will increase from an annual average of &euro;5 billion in the current financial period, to around &euro;7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/22">The rebate was negotiated in 1984, but it did not prevent a very significant rise in the EU's take of member states' national income. Nor did it deal with the underlying problem which made the rebate necessary. And it did not prevent the UK paying twice as much as France and Italy, countries with similar sized economies. With these proposals today, Europe's spending comes down as a proportion of income. And for the first time since the UK joined 30 years ago, we would pay roughly the same as France and Italy as a share of national income.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/23" class="italic">Reform</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/24">This is a budget which seeks to invest in Europe's future, and not only through enlargement.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/25">Our proposals provide for a comprehensive and wide-ranging review, covering all aspects of revenue and expenditure, including agriculture. This will be conducted by the Commission, which will submit a report in 2008. On the basis of the review, the EU would be able to make changes in the 2007&ndash;13 financial period.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/26" class="italic">Conclusion</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/27">We have always made clear that our overall aim is to secure fundamental reform of spending which would remove the underlying justification for the rebate. The mechanism we propose for a review both of revenue and expenditure undertaken by the Commission would put us on a pathway to a reformed European Union better able to compete in the global economy. The budget we have circulated today is a tough package which recognises the responsibilities of all members of the EU to both pay a fair contribution towards the future well-being of the Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/28">It provides a sound basis on which all our citizens can thrive in an enlarged European Union. A bigger, more prosperous European Union means a stronger, more prosperous Britain. These are good proposals for the UK and good proposals for Europe.</p>
