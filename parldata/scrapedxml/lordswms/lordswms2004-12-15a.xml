	Legal Services: Clementi Report
</major-heading>

	<p pid="a.83.3/1">The Government warmly welcome Sir David Clementi's report on the future regulation of legal services in England and Wales. Sir David and his team deserve our thanks for all their work over the past 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/2">I established Sir David's review to consider the regulation of legal services with the clear objective of improving the service to the consumer. The provision of legal services must include safeguarding the public's right to independent legal advice and ensuring the quality and professionalism of the legal professions. Reform will be judged by the benefits it delivers for the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/3">People expect value for money and services that are delivered in ways which better suit their needs. They also expect proper redress if something goes wrong as a result of poor service. The legal professions are no exception. Whether we are buying a house or getting advice about our rights, the way in which lawyers, legal executives and those who advise on legal issues work, how they are regulated and what the processes are for complaining about their work potentially affects us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/4">The Government broadly accept the main recommendations of Sir David's important report and the arguments for change which he sets out. We want to ensure proportionate and appropriate regulation and separate handling of consumer redress. We will want to work closely on the details of his report with all of those involved, especially those representing the legal professions and consumer interests, to take forward this report and deliver reform quickly. We will be careful to ensure as small a bureaucracy as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/5">We strongly support the objectives set out in Sir David's report: maintaining the rule of law, providing access to justice, ensuring protection for consumers, promoting competition, encouraging a strong and effective legal profession and increasing public understanding. To achieve those objectives, Sir David's principal recommendations are the creation of a new oversight regulator with significant powers, the separation of the representative and regulatory functions of the professional bodies, the creation of a single new complaints body and steps to enable the creation of legal disciplinary practices (LDPs). These changes could see non-lawyers for the first time not only as managers of legal practices, but also as owners of and investors in LDPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/6">I am sure that the legal professional bodies will engage positively with us. The Government's overriding aim is to preserve the best of the current system while moving forward for the benefit of consumers. While there are challenges in the report, we have worked together successfully on a number of issues, including the establishment of a new interim system for the appointment of Queen's Counsel. I am confident that we will continue to do so on the issues arising from Sir David's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/7">The Government will publish a White Paper on Sir David's proposals as soon as possible next year, to be followed by legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/8">Today, in response to Sir David's report we can affirm our commitment to putting in place a regulatory framework that ensures a better deal for consumers through increased competition, innovation and transparency, and safeguards the independence of the legal professions&mdash;including independence from government&mdash;in providing high-quality advice. Sir David's report provides a clear basis for achieving these aims and the Government are committed to taking this forward as a matter of paramount importance.</p>

	Diplomatic Representation: UK Overseas Network
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-12-15a.84.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="84"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo041215/text/41215-23.htm#41215-23_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.84.1/1">In December 2003, in the White Paper: <i>UK International Priorities: A Strategy for the FCO</i> (Cm 6052), my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Jack Straw) set out the Government's international priorities for the next five to 10 years and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategy for delivering them in a world of new challenges, opportunities and threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/2">On the basis of that strategy and the outcome of the 2004 spending round, we have been completing a reorganisation of the FCO in London and considering changes to our overseas network in order to align our resources more effectively to our priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/3">This Statement concerns changes to the overseas network, aimed at enhancing our effectiveness in representing British interests abroad, and helping to deliver an efficient service on behalf of the British taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/4" class="italic">Context</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/5">The FCO's overseas network currently comprises:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/6" class="indent">153 sovereign posts (embassies and high commissions) staffed by UK-based diplomats and local staff;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/7" class="indent">70 subordinate posts (consulates general and consulates) reporting to an embassy or high commission; 10 missions to international organisations and conferences such as the UN, the EU and NATO; and resident governors in nine of the 14 overseas territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/8">Since 1997 we have made a series of changes in the overseas network to respond to changing priorities. UK-based staff numbers have grown by 9 per cent from about 5,600 in 1997 to about 6,100 now. We have opened 18 new sovereign and subordinate posts with UK-based staff since 1997, along with 13 locally staffed posts. Ten posts have been closed over the same period (excluding the announcements in this Statement). By comparison, France, with a network of almost identical size to our own, has since 2000 opened nine new posts and closed three. Germany today has 11 fewer posts than in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/9">In the past three years the UK has opened major new missions in Baghdad, Basra, Kabul and Pyongyang (North Korea) in response to changing needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/10">This Statement sets out some further changes to our overseas network. As with changes in the past, they reflect changing demands and challenges, and the need better to align our resources with our priorities, to maximise efficiency and to ensure that the UK has a cost-effective and flexible network of overseas representation.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/11" class="italic">Sovereign Posts</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/12">We intend to close eight sovereign posts with UK-based staff, and one locally-staffed post (Tarawa, Kiribati). Details are set out in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.84.1/44">All these cover arrangements are subject to confirmation and agreement with the host governments concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/45">Separately, in Europe, there is no question of closing down our embassy to the Holy See. However, we have concluded that we will be able to maintain our interests if we widen the pool of potential candidates as ambassador to beyond the FCO when we look for a successor to the present incumbent next summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/46" class="italic">Subordinate Posts</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/47">We also plan to streamline UK representation in subordinate posts (primarily in OECD countries) in line with UK Trade and Investment's (UKTI) new approach to trade promotion in developed countries (see below), while expanding our honorary consul network worldwide. Experience for example in our posts in Italy has shown that fully localised posts are able to deliver services in a cost-efficient, professional and effective way under the strategic direction of the superintending embassy; and our plans extend that model elsewhere. We expect political work to be carried out mainly in capitals, except in large, federal countries like the USA.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/48">We propose moving to locally engaged staff in only 11 posts. And we plan to close 10 subordinate posts altogether. Changes are set out in the following table, together with details of how the network in each country will look after these changes have been made.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.1/168">In Aden, we will retain the services of our local consul, but move from the existing consulate to smaller premises with a view to establishing an honorary consulate.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/169" class="italic">UK Trade and Investment</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/170">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has worked closely with UKTI in formulating these proposals. UKTI is focusing its overseas resources where its commercial teams can make the most impact. This includes strengthening our work to attract inward investment to the UK, and reinforcing support for British businesses in important emerging markets, such as China, where government support makes a real difference to business, and where very strong economic growth means enormous opportunities. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's recent announcement of the establishment of an Asia task force will build on this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/171">To provide the resources for these new activities, UKTI has decided to take a number of steps better to match resources to demand. Commercial services in a number of smaller markets are being re-organised. In the UK's smallest overseas markets, UKTI services themselves in FCO posts covering these markets will be withdrawn, although support and advice from UKTI's website and from its teams in London will still be available. And, importantly, political support and lobbying by ambassadors and high commissioners in support of British business in these markets will continue to be available everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/172" class="italic">Timing and savings</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/173">We plan to have implemented all these changes before the end of 2006. The main savings from the package will be in staff and running costs, including rentals. There will be some one-off costs, including for redundancy. But once these have been met, overall savings should amount to around &pound;6 million per annum as a contribution to the FCO's overall efficiency target of &pound;86 million. (A further &pound;0.5 million of savings are part of our efficiency plan for the 2002 spending review). There will be some revenue from asset sales, although these will take time to realise.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/174">The savings made will help to underpin higher-priority work in line with the FCO's strategic priorities, including on counter proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. Some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. In Africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in Nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy, and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering Maseru and Mbabane.</p>
