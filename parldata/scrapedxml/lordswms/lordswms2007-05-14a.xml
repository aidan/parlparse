<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-05-14a.2.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="2"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70514-wms0001.htm#07051421000015">
	<p pid="a.2.1/1">The following list sets out the key performance targets that have been set for the Public Guardianship Office (PGO) for April to September 2007 prior to the implementation of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/2">The implementation of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 brings the replacement of the Public Guardianship Office with the Office of the Public Guardian and its head, the public guardian.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/3">The Mental Capacity Act comes into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>. The Public Guardianship Office will continue to operate until its replacement by the Office of the Public Guardian and the following key performance targets have been set for the office until that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/4"><I>KPI 1: To increase the satisfaction of its customers in the delivery of its services as measured by customer surveys throughout the year.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/5">Targets:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/6">to achieve an overall customer satisfaction rating of 75 per cent; andto reduce dissatisfaction amongst each of our different customer groups (lay, local authority and professional receivers, and EPA attorneys) by 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/7"><I>KPI 2: To maintain the proportion of effective visits by the Lord Chancellor's visitors.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/8">During the course of April to September 2007 the primary focus for the visiting service will be on preparation for the implementation of the Mental Capacity Act and developing a new visiting process that will work effectively post-enactment. During this period of transition the PGO will visit at least 4,000 clients. A &quot;visit&quot; takes place when a visitor travels to and meets a PGO client in their home or abode. In this instance it does not constitute the receipt of a visit report by the PGO.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/9">Targets:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/10">80% of the 4,000 visits will be effective. An effective visit is one where:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/11">the visit is carried out within six months of the request being made; and recommended action is initiated within one calendar month of the visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/12"><I>KPI 3: To maintain an effective system to collect and review accounts.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/13">Targets:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/14">to collect 60 per cent of accounts, in all cases where an account is properly due, within two calendar months of the accounting end date; 85 per cent within four calendar months of the accounting end date; and 95 per cent within six calendar months of the accounting end date; andto review a sample of no less than 10 per cent of accounts. One hundred per cent of these will be reviewed within 20 working days of receipt.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/15"><I>KPI 4: To maintain our service to clients.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/16">Targets:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/17"><I>Correspondence</I>Respond to: 60 per cent of correspondence within five working days of receipt; 80 per cent of correspondence within 10 working days of receipt; and 98 per cent of correspondence within 15 working days of receipt.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/18"><I>Release of funds</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/19">To work with receivers to ensure they have access to funds to support the client for a year at a time. Where requests for release of funds are made over and above this, the PGO will give directions to the Court Funds Office, or dispatch directions to the receiver (i) within five working days in 80 per cent of cases and (ii) within 10 working days in 95 per cent of cases; or explain why it cannot release funds.<I>Applications for Receivership</I>Providing it has all the appropriate forms and information required in support of an application, the PGO will list a case for hearing and notify the applicant within 10 working days in 95 per cent of cases; the hearing date will be within 35 working days of the date the hearing was listed in 95 per cent of cases; after the hearing, the PGO will notify applicants of the outcome of the hearing and request any further information the court requires within five working days in 95 per cent of cases; andthe PGO will issue orders within 10 working days in 95 per cent of cases where all information and documents have been received.<I>Enduring Powers of Attorney</I>The PGO will register and return 98 per cent of correctly lodged EPAs, where there are no objections, within five working days of the end of the statutory waiting period (35 days from the latest date on which notices of intention to register the EPA were sent or given).<I>Accuracy of Orders</I>The PGO will ensure that in at least 98 per cent of cases, orders will not be returned because of errors.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/20"><I>KPI 5: To demonstrate improvements in efficiency in value for money terms we aim to meet unit cost targets for undertaking each case in each of our main business streams as follows:</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/21">Targets:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/22">enduring powers of attorney&mdash;&pound;120 per case;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/23">appointing and supervising receivers&mdash;&pound;575 per case.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/24">the PGO is required to recover the full cost of its services. This excludes the cost of remissions as the Court of Protection has the discretion to waive a fee if the client or their dependants would experience hardship by paying. For the 2007 period the PGO is seeking to recover costs as follows:enduring powers of attorney&mdash;100 per cent of costs recovered; andappointing and supervising receivers&mdash;82 per cent of costs recovered.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/25"><I>KPI 6: The transition of PGO receivership cases in advance of the implementation of the MCA.</I></p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/26">Target:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/27">to review no fewer than 12,000 lay receiver cases by 30<sup></sup>September 2007.
