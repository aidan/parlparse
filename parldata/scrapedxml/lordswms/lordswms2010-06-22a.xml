The council agreed that the EU should extend the operation for a further two years and the Foreign Secretary stated the UK would be willing to offer Northwood as the operation headquarters until the end of 2012.

	<p pid="a.102.1/35">I supported the principles of the ECI, but expressed concern about the level of bureaucracy in the proposal; specifically, dual admissibility checks, verification processes and the lack of an impact assessment. However, I noted that this was only the start of a process, and that the general approach would evolve. As parliamentary scrutiny is still outstanding, I said that the UK would abstain from supporting at this time. The presidency concluded that it had sufficient support to proceed with the general approach, but acknowledged the UK's concerns and recognised that the UK had captured the mood of the council.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-06-22a.104.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100028" speakername="Earl Attlee" colon=":" colnum="104"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/100622-wms0001.htm#10062246000051">
	<p pid="a.104.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Philip Hammond) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">I will attend the second Transport Council of the Spanish presidency which will take place in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-24">24 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">A wide-ranging EU-US air transport agreement came into effect in April 2008. Its provisions included removal of all commercial restrictions on flights between the EU and the US; and improved co-operation in safety, security, competition, consumer protection and the environment. Negotiations for stage 2 of the agreement began in May 2008. The negotiations have led to a solid outcome, which includes recognition of the importance of greater access for airlines to global capital markets and a widening of the reach of the agreement in environmental matters. I propose to agree to the signature of the stage 2 agreement at the council. A signing ceremony is planned for later in the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">The Commission will present to the council its report on the EU response to the consequences of the recent volcanic ash cloud on air transport. The Commission's report was produced at the request of an extraordinary session of the Transport Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-04">4 May</phrase>. The Commission is expected to provide an overview of the technical work that has been taking place at national, European and global level to increase the understanding of safe flying in areas affected by ash and to examine how the rules and guidance might be improved. My intention would be to encourage further co-operation in this area in order to ensure that airlines and passengers are subjected to the minimum of disruption internationally should there be another eruption. The issue of financial assistance for companies affected by the ash disruption may arise. While recognising the significant financial impact of lost revenue and/or passenger assistance, I do not intend to raise any expectations and would propose to emphasise that budgetary constraints make any support from UK taxpayers unlikely.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/5">The council will be asked to adopt conclusions following the Commission communication on urban mobility, which set out an action plan. We support the principles of the action plan, and the opportunity to spread best practice across the Community. The conclusions take a common-sense approach by making use wherever possible, of existing institutions, programmes and instruments. I welcome the recognition that intelligent transport systems offer strategic options for improving urban mobility as this is an area that the UK has focused on. I also welcome the focus in the conclusions on research of all kinds on clean and energy-efficient vehicles. It is important that the action plan does not lead to further legislation, and that cities and city regions retain the freedom to pursue and implement locally relevant solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/6">There will be a policy debate on the role of transport in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. No conclusions are expected and no decisions will be taken. I will take the opportunity to highlight how EU transport policy can and should promote jobs and growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/7">Notable among the AOB items is a report from the Commission on security scanners. This report concludes that security scanners at airports could help to reinforce passenger security and where deployed should be covered by common EU wide standards covering performance, fundamental rights and health provisions. Scanners are currently deployed at several UK airports.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.3/1">My honourable friend the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury has today made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.3/2">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced today as part of the Budget an increase in the standard rate of VAT to 20 per cent to take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-04">4 January 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.3/3">The Government have taken this step to contribute to tackling the deficit. To protect the public finances from artificial avoidance aimed at exploiting the change in VAT rate where there is no current economic activity, the Finance Bill 2010 will contain anti-forestalling legislation to ensure that the VAT rate change is fully effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.3/4">Anti-forestalling legislation will apply from today to ensure that, in the circumstances specified, supplies with a basic time of supply after the VAT rate increase takes effect will be subject to the rate of VAT in force at that time. The provisions are designed to prevent artificial forestalling whilst not affecting genuine commercial transactions, and few businesses will need to operate them. The legislation is not intended to catch the normal commercial activity of providing goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.3/5">The attached anti-forestalling legislation will apply from today, but any extra VAT arising from its operation will not become due at the earliest until the date of the VAT rate change. Until then, suppliers should continue to account for VAT as normal, applying the VAT rate at the time of the prepayment, VAT invoice issue or grant of the right or option.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.3/6">Further guidance on the anti-forestalling legislation is available at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a>. Copies of the guidance have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
