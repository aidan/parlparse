	Cancer: Herceptin
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-12c.1.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="1"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060612/text/60612-25.htm#60612-25_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.1.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May</phrase> Roche, the manufacturers of Herceptin (trastuzumab), announced that the European Commission had granted a licence extension for Herceptin to include use in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June</phrase> the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published its draft guidance on Herceptin. It recommends the drug for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, except where there are concerns about cardiac function. The full draft recommendations are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/4" class="indent">1.1 Trastuzumab, given at three-week intervals for one year or until disease recurrence, whichever is the shorter period, is recommended as a treatment option for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy, if applicable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/5" class="indent">1.2 Cardiac function should be assessed prior to the commencement of therapy, and trastuzumab treatment should not be offered to women who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55 per cent or less, or who have any of the following: a history of documented congestive heart failure, high-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias, angina pectoris requiring medication, clinically significant valvular disease, evidence of transmural infarction on electrocardiograph (ECG), and/or poorly controlled hypertension.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/6" class="indent">1.3 Cardiac functional assessments should be repeated every three months during trastuzumab treatment. If the LVEF drops by 10 per cent from baseline and to below 50 per cent then trastuzumab treatment should be suspended. A decision to resume trastuzumab therapy should be based on a further cardiac assessment and a fully informed discussion of the risks and benefits between the individual patient and their clinician.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/7">These recommendations are subject to an appeal period, which closes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-28">28 June 2006</phrase>. During this period registered stakeholder organisations, including those representing healthcare professionals, patients and carers, can appeal against the draft guidance. Final guidance is expected to be issued at the beginning of July 2006, assuming that there are no appeals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/8">Once finalised, the recommendations will mean that all eligible patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer should receive Herceptin on the NHS. Although the recommendations are subject to appeal, there are no national restrictions on the NHS using Herceptin in the interim, and the draft recommendations should, of course, be taken into account by primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/9">I would like to congratulate NICE on issuing its draft recommendations on Herceptin just two weeks after the drug was licensed for use in early breast cancer. This shows how the new single-technology appraisal process allows NICE to issue guidance within weeks of a licence being granted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/10">The important thing now is for NHS cancer networks to ensure that all women diagnosed with early breast cancer receive a HER2 test to determine if they are HER2 positive and might therefore benefit from treatment with Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.1/11">Professor Mike Richards, the national cancer director, is already working with cancer networks to ensure that testing arrangements are put in place. I am expecting an update from Professor Richards next week and I will ensure that both Houses receive a report on progress soon afterwards.</p>

	<p pid="c.2.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.2.1/2">Section 14(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) requires me to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of the control order powers during that period.</p>
	<p pid="c.2.1/3">During the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-11">11 March</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-10">10 June 2006</phrase>, three orders were made with the permission of the court under Section 3(1)(a) of the 2005 Act&mdash;two in respect of British citizens, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-05">5 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase>, and one in respect of a foreign national, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-16">16 May 2006</phrase>. There are 14 control orders currently in force, five of which are in respect of British citizens.</p>
	<p pid="c.2.1/4">One request to modify a control order obligation was refused during the period. A right of appeal exists in Section 10(3) of the 2005 Act against a decision by the Secretary of State not to modify an obligation contained in a control order. This has not been exercised in respect of this refusal.</p>

	<p pid="c.6.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.1/2">I informed honourable Members on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March</phrase> of the official launch of the United Nations (UN) Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). The CERF is intended to provide UN humanitarian agencies with early funding so that they can respond immediately when a crisis strikes, and to enable them to channel funds to neglected emergencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.1/3">To date, the CERF total stands at $262 million from 42 donors, of which the UK is the largest single contributor, with $70 million (&pound;40 million) for this first year of operation. The CERF has made an encouraging start, with $92 million committed to a number of humanitarian crises, the largest allocations of which are to the Horn of Africa ($25 million); Darfur ($20 million); the Democratic Republic of Congo ($17 million); Chad ($10 million); Niger ($6 million); C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire ($2 million); and Burundi ($2 million).</p>
	<p pid="c.6.1/4">The UK has a seat on the CERF advisory group, which provides the UN's emergency relief co-ordinator with advice on the speed and appropriateness of fund allocations and examines performance and accountability. The group had its first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.1/5">In the light of the CERF's encouraging start, and as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the quality and quantity of the UK's response to humanitarian crises, I am pleased to inform the House that I have approved a further commitment to the CERF of &pound;120 million over the next three years, January 2007 to December 2009, which is conditional on DfID continuing to be satisfied with the results that the UN is achieving with the CERF. We will monitor closely the performance of the CERF to ensure that this investment is used to the best effect. I hope that this long-term commitment will encourage other donors to do likewise, thereby strengthening the financial sustainability of the CERF, and we will actively lobby key donors to this end.</p>
