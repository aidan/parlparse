	<p pid="a.168.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.3/2">Today we have published a revised edition of the <I>Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities</I>. The revised code is issued jointly by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and the Secretaries of State for Health and for Education and Skills, and will replace the current guidance (issued in July 2002) with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">4 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.3/3">The code provides clear statutory guidance on how local authorities should carry out their homelessness functions and will assist authorities in providing appropriate and effective responses to homelessness and potential homelessness. It also complements other forms of advice, guidance and best practice which have been produced to help local authorities strengthen the services they provide to help people avoid homelessness, wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.3/4">The revised code strengthens the guidance on dealing with vulnerable groups, including people fleeing violence and families with children. It also includes stronger guidance on preventing homelessness, on providing a wide range of housing options, and limiting the use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.3/5">Copies of the revised <I>Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities</I> are being made available in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies will also be available free of charge from the Department for Communities and Local Government and the guidance can also be accessed through the department's website at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1501614">www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1501614</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.3/1">The Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March 2006</phrase> a consultation on a proposal to create a large facilities council. The consultation was announced in the document <I>Science and Innovation Investment Framework 2004-2014: Next Steps</I>, and the Government asked for responses on two principal questions as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.170.3/2">The Government would welcome views on whether all large facilities operations should be integrated under a new large facilities council, or whether there is a case for some facilities to remain under the management of other research councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.3/3">Furthermore, in the event of a merger, should the grant-giving functions of the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) be moved to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.3/4">Following this consultation, which closed on<phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June</phrase>, the Government have decided to create a new large facilities council by merging the current responsibilities of the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), and the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC). PPARC's grant-giving functions will not be transferred to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Responsibility for nuclear physics will be transferred from EPSRC to the new council. The Government aim to set up the new council so that it can take on its new functions by <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Energy (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/2">I have today published a consultation document on the Government's proposals to implement the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive (the WEEE directive).</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/3">The Government are firmly committed to sustainable development and recognise that effective implementation of the WEEE directive has a key role to play in achieving this goal. Electrical and electronic equipment is the fastest growing category of waste across the European Union, with an estimated 17 to 20 kilogrammes per person produced every year. The UK alone generated around 1 million tonnes of WEEE last year. By ensuring that WEEE is treated, recycled and disposed of to high environmental standards as required by the directive, we protect the environment and human health from the risk of hazardous contamination.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/4">The proposals published today follow on from the implementation review announced last December, and have been developed through extensive consultation with companies and other interested parties who will be directly affected by the new regulations. They represent a balance of controls needed to identify and discourage free-riders and give companies the freedom to find the most cost effective routes to meet their obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/5">The intention is that, subject to the outcome of public consultation, the directive should be transposed into UK law early in 2007, leading to full implementation on <phrase class="date" code="">1 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/6">The consultation document will be placed on the DTI website so that it is available to the wider public. The consultation period will run for 12 weeks, with a closing date for comments of <phrase class="date" code="">17 October 2006</phrase>. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
