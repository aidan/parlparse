	Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-12-14c.193.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="193"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61214-wms0001.htm#06121475000022">
	<p pid="c.193.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan Ryan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/2">I am pleased to inform the House that I have today placed in the Library the annual report of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate for the year 2005. This is the second annual report published by the inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/3">Publication of the report honours a commitment given by the Government in response to a recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures in July 2002 that more information should be made available about the work of the inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/4">In the Government's response, published in January 2003, we welcomed the Select Committee's endorsement of the integrity of the inspectorate and of the important contribution that it has made to the welfare of animals in designated establishments. We also recognised that public awareness of the valuable job done by the inspectorate needed to be improved and concluded that this could be remedied, at least in part, by the publication of an annual report on its work.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/5">The inspectorate's second annual report published today provides an account of how the inspectorate has carried out its main tasks and other work in 2005, and contains a particular focus on two important areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/6">First, it gives a brief introduction to the issue of the acquisition of non-human primates for use in scientific procedures and details the acceptance process and criteria used to determine the suitability of overseas centres that propose to supply UK laboratories with such animals.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/7">Secondly, it addresses in detail the growing use of fish in scientific procedures and explains their major uses during the year. This focus on fish includes information on the role of genetically altered fish, the types of housing required, water quality and other general issues to explain handling, methods of identification and how behaviour is judged as well as environmental enrichment.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/8">The report explains what the inspectors doand how they do it, and provides details of the inspectorate's staffing and structure, ways of working, professional background and skills, and training and development.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/9">The report also explains the inspectorate's key role in assessing and advising Home Office Ministers and officials on applications for personal and project licences and certificates of designation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. It also provides details of the inspection system, through which compliance with licence authorities granted under the 1986 Act is monitored and provides information about visiting patterns and practice and the number of visits carried out during the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/10">I commend the report to the attention of Members.</p>

	<p pid="c.194.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/2">I am today publishing a progress report on <I>The Future of Air Transport</I> White Paper of 2003. Copies are available in the Libraries of the House andthe Printed Paper Office. This document fulfils a commitment to report on progress made in implementing the White Paper by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/3">The progress report confirms the detailed strategy set out in 2003 for the sustainable development of air travel to 2030, balancing the growing aspirations to travel and the economic benefits that it brings with the need to protect the environment. The progress report confirms our earlier assessment that demand for air travel will continue to grow strongly. In line with the conclusions of Sir Rod Eddington's recent study on transport infrastructure, it acknowledges the benefits that meeting this demand brings to business and to individuals across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/4">The Government reaffirm their commitment to the development of the aviation sector, predominantly through making the best use of existing capacity,and ensuring that where new capacity is requiredits provision is in line with our environmental obligations.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/5">In 2003, the White Paper made clear the importance of taking effective international action to tackle aviation's contribution to the global challenge of climate change. The report demonstrates the action that we are taking to ensure that the aviation sector meets its external climate change costs. The Government intend to introduce a new emissions cost assessment, which will be an assessment of whether the aviation sector is meeting its external costs of climate change. This will inform Ministers' decisions on major increases in aviation capacity. We intend to consult on this proposal next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/6">The report confirms our continued strong support for the inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme. We are committed to achieving this as soon as practicable. Since aviation is excluded from the Kyoto protocol we will push hard for the modernisation of the Chicago convention and the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to make it easier for negotiations there to deliver international progress on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/7">The document clearly sets out our intended next steps in delivering the Government's aviation policy. We are committed to reporting again on our progress in implementing these policies in three to five years' time.</p>

	<p pid="c.198.1/1">The Government are today publishing for consultation the draft Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2007, which give effect to the changes the Government announced that they were minded to make on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.1/2">The draft regulations will extend the existing provisions by allowing public authorities to:</p>
	<p pid="c.198.1/3">include reading time, consideration time, and consultation time in the calculation of the appropriate limit, above which requests could be refused on cost grounds; andaggregate all requests made by a person or persons who appear to be acting in concert or pursuanceof a campaign to each public authority within a period of 60 working days for the purposes of calculating the appropriate limit.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.1/4">An independent economic review of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act commissioned by my department and published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October 2006</phrase> found that a small percentage of requests and requestors were placing disproportionately large burdens on public authorities in terms of the costs of officials' time.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.1/5">Whilst the Government believe they are entirely right that a reasonable amount of resource is spent dealing with requests for information we believe, in light of experience, that the existing provisions need to be amended in order to provide the right balance between access to information for all and the delivery of other public services. The draft regulations will allow public authorities to take into account more accurately the work involved in dealing with an FoI request.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.1/6">The draft regulations are being published for a 12-week consultation with responses being invited by <phrase class="date" code="">8 March 2007</phrase>. The consultation paper, which includes a partial regulatory impact assessment, will be sent to key stakeholders. The consultation paper is available on my department's website at <a href="http://www.dca.gov.uk">www.dca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.199.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">My right honourable friend the Minister for Sport (Richard Caborn)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/2">The Government have decided, after much consultation and deliberation, to retain the Horserace Betting Levy Board (the levy board) and the associated horserace betting levy scheme. It is doing so on the basis that the scheme continues to reflect and balance the legitimate needs of racing against the ability of bookmakers to pay in accordance with the prevailing economic position.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/3">The Government announced their intention to abolish the levy board and the levy mechanism in March 2000. This policy was approved on the basis that the horseracing industry was confident that a commercially based alternative funding mechanism was available and requested that the Government abolish the levy board in order that it could fully exploit these new commercial opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/4">The sport proposed to substitute the statutory levy income with a commercial arrangement based on the sale of pre-race data (runners, riders and so on), primarily to bookmakers both here and abroad. The Government, preferring commercial arrangements between industries, brought forward legislation in the form of the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004 to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/5">A judgment by the European Court of Justice in November 2004 cast serious doubt over the sport's ability to enforce substantial payments for the use of its data and, as a result, the viability of the proposed replacement funding model. The Government have since engaged in lengthy discussions with the racing and betting industries on future funding arrangements, resulting in the establishment of an independent Future Funding of Racing Review Group (FFRRG), chaired by Lord Donoughue.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/6">The FFRRG reported earlier this year, concluding that a secure alternative funding mechanism to the levy&mdash;which, at &pound;90 million to 100 million per annum, represents a significant proportion of the sport's income, was not presently available. The loss ofthe levy, without a commercial replacement of comparable value, would have serious and immediate adverse consequences for the racing industry, as well as knock-on effects to other related businesses, notably the betting industry and those within the rural economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/7">Given the importance of the present statutory system, the Government have decided to retain the levy until such time as a secure and adequate alternative commercial funding arrangement can be identified. It also intends to repeal the sections of the existing legislation providing for the levy board's abolition, to ensure that Parliament may be permitted to debate such a measure in light of the prevailing circumstances at the time.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/8">In the mean time, the Government propose to modernise the existing levy mechanism with a view to removing as many of the unnecessary administrative burdens as possible and will consult stakeholders on the form and content of those changes in the New Year. The Government also welcome the horseracing industry's commitment to modernise and establish a new governing and regulatory body from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.1/2">The Government have today laid before Parliament a Command Paper (Cm 6989) detailing proposals for revision of the law on assisted reproduction and embryo research. Copies have been placed in the Library. The proposals are the outcome of a wide-ranging review, which included a public consultation in 2005. The paper also provides more details on the proposed Regulatory Authority for Tissue and Embryos (RATE) which will replace existing regulatory bodies (the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Human Tissue Authority). These proposals will go on to form a Bill to be published in draft for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, the right honourable Adam Ingram, has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.3/2">I am pleased to announce that QinetiQ has been awarded the contract to operate the subsonic target element of the combined aerial target service (CATS) programme worth &pound;364.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.3/3">This contract marks a significant step forward towards the delivery of the CATS project. In linewith the defence industrial strategy, it will provide a rationalised supplier base for the MoD and will produce savings in the order of 10 per cent of the total cost over the 20-year life of the contract. It will also mean that we have a single service provider for subsonic aerial targets. This contract is a public/private partnership arrangement within which QinetiQ will supply and operate subsonic aerial targets for the Armed Forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.3/4">Supersonic aerial targets will be procured by the Ministry of Defence from the US because they are the only country that currently produces supersonic targets that are available to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.5/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.5/2">The <I>Good Practice Guidance on Managing the Introduction of New Healthcare Interventions and Links to NICE Technology Appraisal Guidance</I> has been placed in the Library. This good practice guidance responds to a number of requests received by the department to update guidance originally issued in 1999 (HSC 1999/176). As it is no longer possible to issue health service circulars, this refreshed guidance is being issued as good practice guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.5/3">The updated guidance clarifies the intent of the advice originally published in HSC 1999/176 and expands on the advice that the National Health Service should,</p>
	<p pid="c.201.5/4" class="indent">&quot;use existing arrangements to access the publicly available evidence,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.201.5/5">by providing a list of available evidence resources. This list of resources provides a broad selection of different organisations that provide information on new healthcare interventions. By clarifying what these sources of evidence are, the NHS should be able to use this guidance as the starting point when making decisions on the use of new healthcare interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.5/6">Finally, and most importantly, the refreshed guidance makes it clear that primary care trusts should not refuse to provide treatments simply because guidance from NICE is awaited and explains that the role of NICE is not to assess every healthcare technology intended for use in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.5/7">The purpose of the section on the three-month funding direction is to clarify the original intention of the direction, which involved recognition of the fact that it can take some time to put the necessary funding arrangements in place to make a healthcare intervention available to NHS patients. However, this direction does not intend for the three months to be used as a waiting period prior to implementing NICE guidance.</p>

	<p pid="c.202.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Work and Pensions (James Parnell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.202.3/2">I have today placed a copy of the Pensions Regulator's latest discussion document <I>Abandonment of Defined Benefit Pension Schemes</I> in the Library of the House. The Pensions Regulator's statutory objectives require it to take steps to tackle threats to pension scheme members' benefits. This consultation document sets out how the regulator proposes to regulate situations in which employers seek to transfer pension schemes to less secure arrangements in order to reduce their financial liabilities. In particular, the regulator considers that it is unlikely to be in the best interests of members for the link with an employer of substance to be broken without the employer meeting the cost of buying out the benefits with a regulated insurer.</p>
	<p pid="c.202.3/3">The Government are determined that members of defined benefit pension schemes should have confidence that their pensions are secure, and that their employers will meet their commitments. Effective action by the Pensions Regulator makes a major contribution to member confidence and the security of their pensions, and I welcome this discussion document setting out the regulator's plans in this important area.</p>

	Prisoners: Voting Rights

	<p pid="c.203.1/1">The right to vote in the UK is considered by many to be a privilege as well as an entitlement, and that persons who are convicted of an offence serious enough to warrant a term in prison have cast aside that privilege and entitlement for the duration of their sentence. Successive UK Governments have held to the view that the right to vote forms part of the social contract between individuals and the state, and that loss of the right to vote, reflected in the current law, is a proper and proportionate punishment for breaches of the social contract that resulted in imprisonment. That remains this Government's position, and that of a number of other Council of Europe states.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">Thursday, 2 February 2006</phrase>, the Government committed to consult on the issue of voting rights for convicted UK prisoners, following the <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-06">6 October 2005</phrase> judgment of the European Court of Human Rights Grand Chamber in the case of Hirst. Today the Government have published a consultation document that considers the principles of prisoner enfranchisement and the options available to the UK following the judgment. The judgment decided that total disenfranchisement for all convicted prisoners was not within the terms of the convention.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.1/3">The paper sets out the background to the case of Hirst v UK, the conclusions reached by the Grand Chamber, and proposes a number of potential options on which the Government would welcome views. This is a contentious issue. The Government are firm in their belief that individuals who have committed an offence serious enough to warrant a term of imprisonment, should not be able to vote while in prison. None the less, we recognise that we must decide how to respond to the Grand Chamber's judgment.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.1/4">The Government welcome responses from all sides of the debate. We encourage respondents to consider thoroughly the background material provided and each option before submitting a response. The final date for submitting a response is <phrase class="date" code="">7 March 2007</phrase>. Following the results of this consultation, the Government will produce a second stage consultation document, exploring how any proposed change to current arrangements might work in practice. Once the consultation process has concluded and views have been considered, we will put proposals to Parliament, which must, ultimately, debate and decide upon an issue as significant as this.</p>
