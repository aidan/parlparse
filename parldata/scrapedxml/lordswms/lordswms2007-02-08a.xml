	<p pid="a.48.1/1">My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/2">The fire and rescue service has been undergoing a significant change programme over the past few years so that it is better equipped to meet the challenges of today's world. The way in which the Government engage with the service has also been subject to review. As a consequence, the role and function of Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate has changed, and it no longer undertakes its original core role of inspecting all fire and rescue services in England. We have, therefore, decided that it is no longer appropriate to retain the inspectorate in its current form and that a new professional advisory unit would be better placed to provide independent support to Ministers and officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/3">The unit, which for normal day-to-day working purposes will be called the chief fire and rescue adviser's unit, will be headed by a chief fire and rescue adviser. The primary responsibility for the unit will be to provide Ministers and officials with direct access to a source of authoritative independent professional advice on matters of structure, organisation, performance and future development of fire and rescue business. The unit will also have a number of other duties, including advising Ministers, senior officials, COBR and other government departments during a major emergency and providing professional advice on fire and rescue service matters to local authorities, professional bodies and other interested organisations on FRS matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/4">We will be advertising for the position of chief fire and rescue adviser commencing on <phrase class="date" code="">Sunday 11 February 2007</phrase> and expect the new unit to be formally established by summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/5">The chief fire and rescue adviser will be a high profile position. We will be seeking to attract a candidate with proven experience and well developed skills who can demonstrate a strong record of performance across a broad range of criteria, given the key role that the chief fire and rescue adviser will be expected to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/6">Sir Graham Meldrum, HM Chief Inspector of Fire Services, retired on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January 2007</phrase> after many years of distinguished service as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Fire Services. We have established, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase>, a transition team within the fire and resilience directorate, with a clear brief to manage the interim period and prepare for the formation of the new advisory unit.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 12 February 2007</phrase>, Land Registry will launch a formal consultation exercise to seek views on the first part of the proposed secondary legislation required to enable professional conveyancers and others to have access to the electronic conveyancing network, which Land Registry will establish. Under the Land Registration Act 2002, a person must enter into a network access agreement with the Chief Land Registrar (who is the head of Land Registry) before he or she can carry out conveyancing transactions electronically. The consultation document includes draft network access rules dealing with the types of agreement there will be, the criteria a person must meet before he or she can obtain an agreement, those terms that must be included in an agreement, and the grounds, and procedure, for termination of an agreement by the registrar. The consultation document also includes a draft order, which it is proposed should be made under the Electronic Communications Act 2000, to provide for electronic contracts for registered land. The consultation document will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/2">The Government and Royal Mail have agreed to the financing framework following my Statement of <phrase class="date" code="">18 May</phrase> last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/3">The financing framework will provide Royal Mail with the ability to manage its pension deficit and invest in modernisation to improve its performance and efficiency. In addition to the loan facilities of &pound;900 million and the transfer of &pound;850 million of reserves into an escrow account to support the pension fund announced last year, we have also agreed to make an additional shareholder loan of &pound;300 million available to the business to provide the company with adequate financial headroom. As with the proposed framework already announced, all financing for the Royal Mail will be on commercial terms. We plan to agree the final legal documentation and have these measures in place by <phrase class="date" code="">25 March 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/4">We have also agreed with Royal Mail management a reward scheme that allows the employees to share in the value they help to create in the business as it improves its performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/5">Under this reward scheme the Government have agreed to the company providing employees with &quot;partnership units&quot; of a notional value equivalent to a 20 per cent economic interest in the projected equity value of the group in the ordinary course of business and based on the management's plan. This will allow employees to share fully in the value they help to create. In addition, we have agreed to the replacement of the current and highly effective &quot;Share in Success&quot; programme with a new scheme. To provide adequate certainty for the public finances, while properly rewarding the efforts of Royal Mail employees, the partnership unit scheme will run for the duration of the Royal Mail Letters' transformation plan, up until March 2012. Employees can receive a maximum of &pound;5,300 over the period.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/6">The scheme aligns employee, management and shareholder interests in making all parties committed to the successful performance of the business&mdash;this is the right approach in a fully competitive market.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/7">We fully support the business in delivering the programme of reform that it needs to undertake. We recognise that there are a number of difficult changes that need to be made to the way the company operates, including limiting the pension liability going forward, and fully support the business in making them. It is for the management and staff to make the changes necessary to give the company a sound platform on which to build for long-term success in a competitive market.</p>
