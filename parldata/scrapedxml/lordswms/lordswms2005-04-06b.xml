	<p pid="b.83.3/1">With the support of her Majesty's Government, the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-29">29 March 2005</phrase> adopted Resolution 1591, which extends the Darfur arms embargo to cover all parties to the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents in the states of north Darfur, south Darfur and west Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.3/2">Resolution 1591 (2005) also imposes an assets freeze and a travel ban, with conditional exemptions, on individuals who impede the peace process, constitute a threat to stability in the Darfur region, commit violations of international humanitarian law or human rights law or other atrocities, violate the arms embargo or are responsible for offensive military overflights in and over the Darfur region. The measures are effective 30 days after the adoption of the resolution, unless the Security Council decides that the parties concerned have complied with their commitments in the peace process and demands made by the council in this and previous resolutions. Resolution 1591 (2005) also established a UN sanctions committee and a panel of experts to monitor implementation and enforcement of the measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.83.5/1">In order to ensure that we can provide noble Lords with a better service, both in London and when they travel overseas, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has set up a new database which will enable us to record the foreign affairs issues in which they are interested. We will keep solely factual information which is already in the public domain, for example details of the all-party groups and assemblies of which noble Lords are members, and of overseas and inward visits (e.g. the Inter-Parliamentary Union and Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegations) in which they have taken part. This should enable us better to tailor information and assistance to noble Lords' needs.</p>

	Barcelona Review: UK National Contribution

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-04-06b.84.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="84"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050406/text/50406-47.htm#50406-47_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.84.1/1">At last November's EuroMed foreign ministerial meeting in The Hague, EuroMed Foreign Ministers launched a review of the first 10 years of the Barcelona process and its future direction. A copy of the UK's national contribution to the Barcelona review has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/2">We believe that the review provides the opportunity to refocus the priorities of the Barcelona process and help ensure it delivers results that have a real positive impact for EU and Mediterranean partner citizens. We want to see the review generate a real debate among all EuroMed partners, and in their civil societies, of how to enhance the partnership. We believe that EuroMed should be guided by the principles of the EU's strategic partnership with the Mediterranean and Middle East and the European neighbourhood policy, but mostly by the desire of Mediterranean partners for the EU's engagement and assistance in meeting the challenges of political, social and economic development.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/3">Our national contribution proposes a strategic approach to achieving the vision set out in the 1995 Barcelona declaration. We want to focus EuroMed on achieving a limited number of 10-year targets on governance, education and economic reform. Improved education systems and more vigorous open market competitive economies are crucial to economic growth in EuroMed countries. Without these countries we will not be able to take advantage of trade liberalisation and the creation of a Euromed Free Trade Area by 2010. And improved governance based on democratic institutions, and civil society institutions especially for women and free media, will facilitate the achievement of these targets, as will focused and effective development assistance from the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/4">This is an ambitious agenda, but one whose success is critical to removing the barriers to development in the Middle East and North Africa and to enhancing the relationship between Europe and that region. The review will be negotiated among the 35 EuroMed partners, all of whom will have their own aims and objectives. It will be submitted to Ministers at the EuroMed foreign ministerial meeting in May and will constitute the main input to the EuroMed tenth anniversary event, which the UK will host jointly with Spain in November in Barcelona.</p>

Consistent with the SDR new chapter, this regiment will provide improved support to expeditionary operations overseas and form part of the defence contribution to the Government's comprehensive strategy to counter international terrorism. The SRR will bring together personnel from existing capabilities and become the means of the further development of the capability. Due to the specialist nature of the unit, it will come under the command of the director special forces and be a part of the UK special forces group.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.3/2">I am announcing today the award of a contract to Westland Helicopters Ltd for phase one of the Sea King integrated operational support programme, part of the wider defence logistics transformation programme, which is seeking to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of military logistics support to the front line. The contract is worth &pound;300 million over the first five years, with a price review thereafter, and includes the provision of technical and spares support to the Sea King fleet. It will result in savings of some &pound;50 million over 10 years, which is a considerable improvement on current support costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.3/3">There are seven different variants of Sea King currently in service with the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force in a variety of roles including maritime, air-sea rescue operations and support to land forces. The Sea King integrated operational support programme will improve the way in which support is provided for the Sea King platform, focusing on maximising aircraft availability, improving spares delivery and reducing through-life costs. It will secure the ability of the Sea King to continue operations in support of the UK Armed Forces in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.3/4">Phase two of the programme is expected to be implemented in around eighteen months' time, subject to a successful performance review against phase one implementation.</p>
