	Diplomatic Service
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-03-08a.59.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="59"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60308-32.htm#60308-32_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.59.1/1">In a Written Statement in response to a Question by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">my honourable friend the Member for Pendle (Mr Gordon Prentice)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-28">28 November 2005</phrase>, (<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, col. 165W), my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) said that he hoped to make an announcement soon on his examination of the relevant diplomatic service regulations, with a view to making changes to ensure that they more accurately reflect the overall purpose of the regulations and conventions concerning publications by serving and former officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">The Foreign Secretary has now approved a revised version of diplomatic service Regulation 5, which governs the use of official information or experience, and associated guidance. The new version brings the regulations into line with the Civil Service Management Code and has been brought to the attention of all FCO staff. The main changes are:</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3" class="indent">clarification of the continuing obligation on former officials to obtain permission to write books before entering into commitments with publishers; and to submit texts for clearance;</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/4" class="indent">an explicit bar on memoirs by serving officials, although they may, with permission, write other books and articles; and</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/5" class="indent">the additional requirement to avoid writing anything that would damage the confidential relationship between Ministers, or between Ministers and officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/6">In addition, all contracts of employment and letters issued on retirement or resignation now explicitly draw attention to the rules on publication and the duty of confidentiality. This will be systematically redrawn to the attention of staff at key points in their career. Staff are also required to sign an undertaking which states that they have read, understood and agree to be bound by the rules on publication. David Warren, the director of human resources, has already written to all senior FCO officials to explain the revised requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/7">The regulations will be subject to regular review and revision in line with any future changes to the Civil Service Management Code. The Foreign Secretary will also take into account any relevant recommendations from the Public Administration Select Committee when it reports on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/8">I have placed in the Library copies of the new regulations, the guidance and David Warren's letter to all senior staff.</p>

	Sudan: Darfur
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-03-08a.61.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="61"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60308-32.htm#60308-33_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.61.1/1">Dr Rod Pullen has been appointed as UK special representative at the inter-Sudanese peace talks on Darfur. He took up his position on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase>. This appointment is a further indication of our commitment on this issue. It is in addition to that of Dr Alan Goulty, HMA Tunis, who will also continue as the UK's special representative for Darfur. He will continue to focus primarily on pushing the parties and on getting key regional players (especially Eritrea, Libya) and international players on side. He will also continue to visit Sudan as necessary, in consultation with HMA Khartoum. We also expect him to pay occasional visits to the Abuja talks, in consultation with Rod Pullen, if there is a particular requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/2">The Darfur peace talks are held under African Union (AU) mediation. The UK is a key international partner to the talks, and has maintained an observer at the talks in support of the AU since the beginning. However, in response to the unacceptably slow progress made by the parties, the UK has decided to appoint Dr Pullen, a senior grade diplomat, our former high commissioner to Ghana and our former ambassador to Zimbabwe, as the UK's special representative. This appointment signals the UK's commitment to a peace agreement and to work with all parties to the talks, in support of the AU mediation, to help push the parties towards a comprehensive and viable agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/3">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) expressed the UK's concern about the slow pace of progress when he addressed the talks on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase>, and called upon the parties to rapidly increase momentum. He called on the movements' leaders to demonstrate their commitment to peace by attending the talks. He also announced that the UK had pledged a package of &pound;1 million to the African Union in support of the talks.</p>
