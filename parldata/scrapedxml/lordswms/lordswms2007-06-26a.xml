	<p pid="a.63.1/1">My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Gordon Brown) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/2">The Economic and Financial Affairs Councilwas held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase> in Luxembourg. The UK was represented by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ed Balls. The items discussed were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/3"><I>Implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact: Excessive Deficit Procedures</I></p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/4">The Commission presented its proposal to abrogate the excessive deficit procedures on Malta, Germany and Greece. Ministers agreed conclusions supporting the abrogation of the EDPs.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/5"><I>Convergence Reports by the Commission and the European Central Bank</I></p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/6">The Commission and the European Central Bank presented their convergence reports on Cyprus and Malta, which conclude that both countries have met the Maastricht criteria for joining the euro. Ministers welcomed the Commission and ECB's conclusions, and agreed a letter to be sent to heads of state and government at the European Council on 21 and<phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase>. The final decision on whether both countries will join the euro as planned on <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2008</phrase> will be taken at ECOFIN on <phrase class="date" code="">10 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/7"><I>Quality of Public Finances</I></p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/8">Ministers were presented a report on the efficiency and effectiveness of public finances, focusing in particular on the need to improve the measurement of public sector output. The council adopted conclusions supporting the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/9"><I>Tax</I></p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/10">Combating tax fraud&mdash;Ministers agreed council conclusions on a range of measures to combattax fraud, particularly in the field of VAT. The conclusions covered work on conventional measures and more radical approaches, including a Commission study into the impact of a possible wide reverse charge. The UK supports efforts to combat VAT fraud, particularly work to improve current arrangements such as exchange of information and mutual assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/11">VAT package&mdash;Ministers agreed a package of VAT measures, subject to work on some technical issues which are to be resolved before the end of the forthcoming Portuguese presidency. The UK welcomes this important work to modernise and simplify the existing VAT rules, particularly for cross-border supplies of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/12">Common consolidated corporate tax base&mdash;Ministers held an exchange of views on the Commission's technical work on a CCCTB. The UK does not believe that the competitiveness of the EU would be helped by a harmonised company tax base and remains sceptical about both the principles and the practicalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/13">Code of conduct on business taxation&mdash;the council took note of a report from the code group on its work under the German presidency to combat harmful tax competition. The UK supports the work of the group.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/14">Joint transfer pricing forum&mdash;Ministers agreed conclusions welcoming the work of the joint transfer pricing forum. The UK agrees that the report's recommendations represent best practice, and broadly follows these standards already.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.5/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/2">I am today publishing <I>A National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care in England</I>, which will come into effect on<phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/3">The framework sets out the principles and process for NHS continuing healthcare and NHS-funded nursing care. By introducing national criteria the framework aims to promote consistency and transparency in decision-making and provide clarity for both patients and professionals about what the NHS will provide for those with the most complex long-term care needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/4">It will address the problems surrounding the lack of consistency across the country in the application of the criteria for NHS continuing healthcare and respond to calls by the health ombudsman and the Health Select Committee to bring the locally set criteria and variable decision making into one national system.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/5">The framework will also simplify the interaction between NHS continuing healthcare and NHS funded nursing care.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/6">The final framework was developed following a public consultation undertaken by the department in 2006 that attracted responses from the health and social care sectors, voluntary organisations and users and carers. I am also publishing today a summary of the responses to this consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/7">The framework and the response to the consultation have been placed in the Library and copies are available to honourable Members from the Vote Office.</p>
