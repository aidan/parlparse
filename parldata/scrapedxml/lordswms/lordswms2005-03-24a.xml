	<p pid="a.44.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/2">I am pleased to be able to announce that new regulations governing the payment of financial assistance to reservists and their employers during mobilisation were laid before Parliament today and that subject to parliamentary scrutiny are due to come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-14">14 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/3">These changes represent a significant improvement in the assistance available to reservists and employers. They reaffirm our continuing commitment to the Reserve Forces and reflect the value we place on them and their contribution to the United Kingdom's defence commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/4">These regulations have been prepared following a comprehensive consultation process, which I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-22">22 July 2004</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>62 WS</i>). They replace the previous complex and intrusive scheme which only matched individuals' earnings up to a rank-related threshold or band, with a separate hardship award scheme for those whose earnings exceeded the band for their rank. Payments to employers under that scheme were limited and complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/5">The full detail of the scheme of both reservists and employers are available in the documents laid before the House. I also purpose that the financial limit shall be subject to annual review commencing in April 2006.</p>
