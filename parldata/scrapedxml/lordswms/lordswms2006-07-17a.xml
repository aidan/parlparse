<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-07-17a.69.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60717-wms0159.htm#06071718000016">
	<p pid="a.69.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Tom Watson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">As foreshadowed by my predecessor in his Statement in March 2005, I am announcing today the outcome of the study to explore whether there is scope for further service improvement through the greater integration of services delivered by the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency and the Veterans Agency. The study has included consultation of trade unions and veterans' groups and has recommended that the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency and the Veterans Agency are integrated on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/3">I have decided that the integration of these two agencies should take place, as it will enable improvements to the service received by both veterans and serving members of our Armed Forces. It is my intention that each of these two groups should be able to access the whole range of services and benefits currently provided by the two agencies, simply by going to their own single, dedicated contact point where their different needs will be understood and valued. Bringing together these agencies will enable the creation of an organisation with separate front-office customer contact for veterans and serving personnel, supported by a single back-office and unified corporate services and strategy, with one person accountable for overall service delivery. This chief executive will be supported by directors with responsibility respectively for services to veterans and services to those currently serving. The new structure will enable more joined-up and hence more accurate assessments of total entitlements that currently span two agencies. It will also facilitate the development of integrated business processes and IT, leading in due course to further improvements in services for serving and retired members of the Armed Forces and their beneficiaries, thus providing excellent and efficient service from cradle to grave.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/4">Integrating these two agencies does not of itself imply an intention to collocate or further outsource services. These are separate issues to be considered on their merits as and when opportunities arise or existing contracts expire. Integration is designed to improve the administrative support we provide to the Armed Forces and veterans; and robust key targets will be set to ensure no erosion in the quality of service provided. Bringing together the agencies is consistent with the pan-government initiative for more coherent, joined-up approaches to service delivery. To retain a sharp focus on the quality of veterans' services and to reassure elderly customers through a sense of continuity, the Veterans Agency name for the veterans' contact point will be retained, with a director dedicated to veterans' services. As Minister for veterans, I am committed to ensuring that the quality of service to veterans and their dependants as well as the serving population is continued and improved even further under the new arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2">I have today published a consultation paper, <I>New Powers for Organised and Financial Crime</I>, which will make the UK the least desirable place for organised criminals to operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/3">The proposals build on the plans set out in March 2004 in the Government's White Paper <I>One Step Ahead: A 21</I><sup><I>st</I></sup><I> Century Strategy to Defeat Organised Crime</I>. Those plans have been brought into being by the passing of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 and the establishment of the Serious Organised Crime Agency from April this year. The proposals on which we are now consulting would:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/4">improve data-sharing within the public sector and between the public and the private sectors to help prevent crime;introduce new offences of encouraging or assisting a criminal act to strengthen the current law and make it easier to bring to justice those involved in the margins of organised crime;establish a new civil crime prevention order to prevent organised criminal activity by individuals or organisations by imposing conditions on them; andstrengthen the working of proceeds of crime legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/5">We believe that these additional measures would provide important new means for tackling organised criminality still more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/6">Copies of the consultation document are available in the Library and on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. We should be glad to receive views by <phrase class="date" code="">17 October 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/2">The Employment, Social Policy, and Health informal meeting was held on 6 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase> in Helsinki, Finland. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">My honourable friends the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Service (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> and the Minister for Health Services (Rosie Winterton) and I represented the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/3">The theme of the informal was to look at the challenges of globalisation and demographic ageing. The workshops were divided into three parallel groups. My honourable friend Jim Fitzpatrick participated in the workshop on productivity and quality of working life and focused on the UK experience and strategy for promoting high performance in the workplace as set out in <I>Success at Work</I>. I represented the workshop on prolonging working life for men and women and highlighted the Government's plans to extend working life through pension reform and measures to help people to stay in work and to balance their caring responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/4">My honourable friend Rosie Winterton spoke about the health, work and well-being strategy and emphasised the message that work is good for health, especially mental health, in the workshop looking at how to promote health in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/5">The presidency drew conclusions from the three workshops and said that it had seen a consensus that the ageing population raised clear challenges, which could best be met by shared objectives for employment, social and health policies. This could include flexicurity, effective social protection and consistent action on health. The flexibility needed to embrace social change should include action on work-life balance, gender equality, lifelong learning and health and safety to make work more attractive and increase productivity. Social partners and civil society must be fully engaged. All actions should be tailored to the needs of women and men.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">The commencement date for tenancy deposit protection will be <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2007</phrase>. The summary of responses to the consultation on the tenancy deposit protection secondary legislation was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-23">23 June 2006</phrase>. The consultation sought views on the information requirements to be placed on landlords and the handling of deposits at the beginning and end of the tenancy. Alongside the publication of the summary of responses, the Government announced that the commencement date of <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase> was under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3">Responses to the consultation raised concerns about joint authorisation for deposit repayment where either landlord or tenant cannot contact the other party to obtain agreement. This includes situations where there are rent arrears and a tenancy has been abandoned.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">Further consideration has now been given to stakeholders' concerns expressed in the consultative process and the Government recognise that it would be beneficial to both landlords and tenants to enable single claims to be made on the deposit in certain circumstances. We therefore intend to bring to the House proposals to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">To ensure all provisions are in place and stakeholders have had the opportunity to prepare for the introduction of tenancy deposit protection, the commencement date has been moved from <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2007</phrase>, which is a common commencement date.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Public Health (Caroline Flint) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">Today the Department of Health publishes a consultation on proposed regulations for smoke-free premises and vehicles to be made under Part 1 of the Health Bill. The medical and scientific evidence of the risks to health from exposure to second-hand smoke is well established and is set out in the 1998 and 2004 reports of the independent Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, and the 2004 report of the World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">A key aspect of the Government's strategy as set out in the White Paper <I>Choosing Health: making healthy choices easier</I> is to shift the balance significantly in favour of smoke-free enclosed public places and workplaces through legislation in order to reduce levels of exposure to second-hand smoke. The smoke-free provisions in the regulations to be made under the Health Bill are a huge step forward for public health by reducing exposure in enclosed public places and workplaces to the hazards of second-hand smoke. The consultation seeks comments on the content of the regulations and their implementation. The consultation period will run for 12 weeks, closing on <phrase class="date" code="">2 October 2006</phrase>. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/2">The Department for Transport has today issued a consultation document for the attention of stakeholders seeking views on the proposed review of the maximum level of MoT fee due for implementation later this year. The letter proposes an increase in the maximum level of fee for a car (MoT test Class IV) from &pound;44.15 to &pound;50.35 from October 2006. This represents an increase of &pound;6.20. The Government do not intend to increase the maximum price again until April 2008 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/3">The increase in the maximum fee level follows an analysis of how long garages actually spend performing the test, which shows it now takes nearly an hour, on average, to fully MoT a car. This includes a check of up to 26 systems and components, including safety critical ones such as tyres and brakes.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/4">Prescribed MoT fee levels are a maximum&mdash;some garages do not charge the full fee. Some garages simply charge less than maximum, some offer free retests and some even make no charge for the test provided it is combined with a full service.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/5">The increase in fees will go to the garages to cover the costs of their time, with a small amount&mdash;27p&mdash;going to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency to cover the costs of running the system, which will in turn be passed to the service provider.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/6">A copy of the letter is available in the House Libraries. The proposed new fee levels have already been subject to informal consultation with interested parties so there is a shortened consultation period, which expires on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
