	Airports: Security
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-16a.65.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="65"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-wms0001.htm#80716-wms0001.htm_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.65.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/2">My department, in conjunction with the Home Office, has today begun a consultation on aspects of the Transport Security Bill designed to deliver more effective policing and security planning arrangements at airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/3">The consultation sets out a new security planning process that:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/4">requires the majority of airports in the UK to agree a local airport security plan with their key stakeholders, based upon an agreed threat and risk analysis; andallows any policing element of this plan to be charged to the airport operator.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/5">As a consequence, the activities of the police, aviation industry and control authorities will be better co-ordinated to enhance and strengthen security planning. The process of security planning will provide a greater level of understanding to all security stakeholders at an airport as to why they are carrying out certain functions and what resources are required. It is also important that we create a level playing field whereby all airport operators pay for any dedicated police presence required at their airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/6">Given the importance of strong policing and security planning in the current climate, we are using the opportunity of introducing a Transport Security Bill into Parliament next Session to deliver these objectives as well as including provisions to combat terrorist acts at sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/7">It is important to note that airports already provide a secure environment for the travelling public and industry staff. We now want to ensure that security is addressed at individual airports in a structured way, and that the role of the police in preventing criminal activity is clearly determined.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/8">Today's proposals have developed from the findings of the independent review of airport policing that was presented to the Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Transport in July 2006. The Department for Transport and Home Office, working jointly, have developed the measures in close consultation with senior representatives from industry and the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/9">Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	Apprenticeships Bill (Draft)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-16a.65.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100797" speakername="Baroness Morgan of Drefelin" colon=":" colnum="65"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-wms0001.htm#80716-wms0001.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.65.3/1">Today, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) and I publish the draft Apprenticeships Bill. In January 2008, World Class Apprenticeships set out plans for achieving our aspirations for the apprenticeships programme. This draft Bill sets out the legislative framework needed to underpin our strategy to increase the number of apprenticeship places and strengthen apprenticeships in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/2">Our ambition is that apprenticeships are seen as a key route to the best jobs, the best careers and the best chance to get on in life. Apprenticeships are at the heart of our strategy to raise the age of participation in education or training for all young people, with high quality vocational training clearly recognised as a mainstream route for young people. Apprenticeships will also help build a workforce fit for the future by providing better and more relevant skills to enable us to compete in the global economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/3">Since 1997, we have substantially increased investment in apprenticeships, and the number of starts has increased from 65,000 in 1996-97 to 180,000 in 2006-07. This increase has been accompanied by a steady improvement in the number of people completing apprenticeships, from 40,000 in 2001-02 to 112,000 in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/4">We want to build on this success. We want a significant increase in the number of places so that by 2013 we can ensure that there is an apprenticeship place for every suitably qualified young person who wants one. We want to strengthen the programme so that we can ensure that all apprenticeships are of a uniformly high quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/5">Following pre-legislative scrutiny and the consultation we are launching today, the provisions in the draft Bill will form part of the Education and Skills Bill we will introduce in the next Session.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.3/6">Copies of the draft Apprenticeships Bill will be made available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper office.</p>

	Armed Forces: Medical Services
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-16a.66.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100844" speakername="Baroness Taylor of Bolton" colon=":" colnum="66"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-wms0001.htm#80716-wms0001.htm_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.66.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Derek Twigg) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/2">Ministers have now approved the redevelopment of Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, for use by the Defence Medical Services (DMS) and I am today announcing the next steps.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/3">The assessment phase of the Midlands medical accommodation project has been completed. We have concluded that the strategic, operational, economic and personnel benefits of the project will fully justify an investment of around &pound;200 million over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/4">Co-location on the Whittington site of the DMS headquarters and the Defence Medical Services Training Centre (DMSTC, currently based near Aldershot) will give us a critical mass of military medical expertise and assets in the Midlands. The area will be reinforced as the central focus for British military medicine, and Lichfield will provide the future military home for the DMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/5">Our project assessment confirmed that the Whittington site offers excellent potential for meeting DMS needs. A combination of new build and upgrading of existing buildings will provide ample high-quality, fit-for-purpose accommodation, training and sports facilities, within easy travelling distance of central Birmingham and the RCDM elements that will remain there. The Whittington site also offers an adjacent military training area. Full planning approval for the redevelopment of the site has already been granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/6">The project will be delivered in three increments:</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/7">an HQ office building; new and refurbished training accommodation; combined officers' and senior NCOs' mess; junior ranks' dining room; training centre; and lecture theatre; and delivery of 811 single living accommodation bed spaces.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/8">Increment one will involve the relocation to Lichfield of key management elements of the DMS, whose top structure is currently being reorganised as part of the DMS top structures next steps programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/9">Development of a new strategic medical HQ and the HQ for the recently established Joint Medical Command (JMC) is now in progress. We are planning to locate these HQs at Lichfield by <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase> (although a small number of strategic medical HQ staff will remain in London). The HQ of the JMC will comprise staffs currently based at Fort Blockhouse, Gosport, who were formerly part of the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency; Defence Dental Services HQ staffs from RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire; the Defence Healthcare Directorate from central London; and elements of the RCDM HQ from Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/10">We shall place a contract later this year for the construction at Whittington of a purpose-built office block and associated site infrastructure works. We shall announce further details when this contract is placed. By early 2010 we expect that the site will be supporting over 300 military and civilian personnel in total. Almost 200 of these will be military and civilian posts transferred from central London, Gosport and Halton. Some posts will also be relocated from the RCDM HQ in central Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/11">Increments two and three will see the relocation of the DMSTC from Keogh Barracks, Aldershot, to Lichfield, and the provision of training facilities and living accommodation for over 800 staff and trainees. Existing facilities need to be replaced with accommodation that is fit for the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/12">The move of DMSTC will be completed between 2012 and 2014. The precise date will be decided in due course. By the end of the project there will be over 1,100 Defence Medical Services personnel at Lichfield, including up to 700 trainees, as well as over 100 personnel attached to lodger units that we expect to remain on the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/13">There will be full consultation with the trades unions as the work on the new organisations and their co-location at Lichfield proceeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/14">The new jobs that this project will bring to the Midlands over the next few years will also help to fulfil our policy objective of moving jobs out of the greater south-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/15">The decisions announced today about military medical accommodation in the Midlands are further evidence of the Government's commitment to the healthcare of service personnel. I shall keep the House informed of progress with this important project.</p>

	Coroners' Inquests
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-16a.68.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="68"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-wms0001.htm#80716-wms0001.htm_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.68.1/1">My honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice), has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following Statement to the House about the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas. All fatalities suffered by our Armed Forces continue to be a source of profound regret. Our sympathies are with their families. It is particularly regrettable that this Statement comes at a time when in recent weeks we have experienced an unusually high rate of fatalities in Afghanistan. Our service personnel risk their lives in helping to build strong, stable and democratic nations, and to protect the interests of the United Kingdom. We cannot pay high enough tribute to the job that they do, or to the ultimate sacrifice which some of them have made. We are, as ever, strongly committed to minimising the effect on their families and loved ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/3">Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-30">30 April 2008</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-04-30.12"><I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 12WS</phrase>) with information about the conduct of inquests by the Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This Statement gives the position at <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-08">8 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/4">For the first time, the tables which accompany this Statement include information about those ongoing cases in which there has been a board of inquiry (BoI) report.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/5">The purpose of a BoI is to examine the circumstances surrounding an incident resulting in death or serious injury, to learn lessons and to make recommendations to the chain of command for the improvement of working practices, procedures or equipment, which could help to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident happening again.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/6">In some cases, the initial review of an incident will highlight any lessons to be learned or actions that could be taken to prevent a similar incident happening again. Dispensation from holding a BoI may be given if there are no further lessons to be learned. This is often the case for incidents occurring on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/7">Ministers and the military chain of command attach considerable importance to the timely completion of BoIs but the overriding requirement is that a thorough investigation identifies the right lessons. It should also be noted that a BoI (and the coroner's inquest) cannot conclude until the completion of any police investigations. The coroner's inquest may take place before completion of a BoI although this rarely happens in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/8"><I>Progress with inquests</I></p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/9">At the time of the last Statement, we reported that since additional funding had been provided by the Government to assist the Oxfordshire coroner, 155 inquests had been held: 141 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/10">Since April, a further 25 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations overseas whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham. This makes a total of 180 inquests held since June 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/11">Since operations commenced there have been a total of 201 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including one serviceman who died in the UK of his injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/12"><I>Open inquests</I><I></I></p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/13"><I>Fatalities Before </I><phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/14">The Statement in April reported that there were 27 inquests to be held into the deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>. As at <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-08">8 July</phrase>, there are nine such inquests. The Oxfordshire coroner has retained jurisdiction in six of these cases; three have been transferred to coroners closer to the deceased's next of kin. Hearing dates have been set in four cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/15">The oldest individual inquest for which no date has yet been set is that into the death of Private Reeves who was killed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-09">9 August 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/16">In addition there are 10 inquests for the crew members who died together in the crash of Hercules XV179 on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-30">30 January 2005</phrase>. These inquests resumed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> and were adjourned until <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/17"><I>Fatalities After </I><phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/18">Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests will not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon jurisdiction, now that fatalities are being repatriated via RAF Lyneham. The coroner, Mr Masters, is continuing the practice of transferring military inquests to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/19">There are 57 inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>. Of these, Mr Masters has retained 34 inquests, whilst 23 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next of kin. Inquest hearing dates have been set in 12 of these cases. Inquests into the two latest fatalities are yet to be opened.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/20"><I>Inquests into the deaths of service personnel who returned home injured</I></p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/21">There remain five inquests to be held of service personnel who returned home injured and subsequently died of their injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/22">We are very grateful for the efforts of all the coroners involved in conducting these inquests.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/23">We shall continue to keep the House informed on a quarterly basis about progress with the remaining inquests. I have placed tables in the Library of the House which outline the status of all cases and date of death of each case. Copies are also available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/24"><I>Liaison with the next of kin</I></p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/25">It is of the greatest importance that the next of kin have full information about the progress of the inquest of their deceased.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/26">We remain committed to providing better support to bereaved military families. The Written Ministerial Statement issued on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-07">7 June 2007</phrase> by my right honourable friend the then Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Adam Ingram), gave details of the support which was then being provided. Since then, we have increased the number of family members who can travel and stay overnight if necessary, at public expense, to attend the repatriation ceremony; and two family members may attend any pre-inquest hearings, as well as the inquest itself, again at public expense.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/27">Visiting officers are crucial in providing the liaison between families and the services, and we continue to give close attention to their selection and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/28">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-01">1 June</phrase>, the Ministry of Defence established the Defence Inquests Unit. This unit acts as the focal point for all coroners' inquests into the deaths of service and Ministry of Defence civilian personnel who die on, or as a result of injuries sustained while on, operations and those who die as a result of training activity. The unit's key role is to assist coroners so that they can complete inquests satisfactorily and as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/29">The unit's main function is to establish early contact with the coroner for each inquest, and to ensure that they are provided with all relevant paperwork, including reports from the Special Investigation Branch and Board of Inquiry (if convened). The unit will also help advise on subject matter experts for inquests. While the relevant service will, rightly, remain the focal point for liaising with the bereaved families, the unit will work closely with the services to ensure that there is a consistent approach, particularly in terms of providing information to families, coroners and welfare officers.</p>

	Crime: Magee Review
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-16a.70.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="70"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-wms0001.htm#80716-wms0001.htm_spmin6">
	<p pid="a.70.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Jacqui Smith) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/2">The House will wish to know that Sir Ian Magee's independent review of criminality information is being published today.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/3">I am grateful to Sir Ian for his work on the review. He has presented us with a substantial report with wide ranging implications for all organisations which collect information that may be relevant to the prevention, investigation, prosecution, or penalising of crime. This is a complex area and there are no quick fixes. Sir Ian's package of recommendations will require sustained attention. I will therefore be consulting widely and I intend to publish a full, government-wide action plan in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/4">The Government are keen to develop work quickly across a range of Sir Ian's recommendations and my department will continue to take the lead in driving this work forward as part of our primary focus on public protection. We intend now to proceed with the following.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/5">First, we will continue with the complex and difficult work which the Home Office has been leading to enhance the information we have about the criminal histories of foreign nationals and UK citizens who have spent time abroad. We will do this both by making better use of existing information channels and by leading a process of improvement within Europe and more widely. This work will significantly improve the way we protect the public by ensuring relevant overseas data are available to inform the criminal justice process and key systems such as those used to vet and bar people seeking to work with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/6">Secondly, we will build on, extend and strengthen existing streams of work, such as the programme the Home Office has led to implement the recommendations from the Bichard inquiry, to develop a clear strategic direction for the improvement of criminality information management across what Sir Ian is calling the public protection network. That will provide the framework for positive changes to sharing of criminality information, training for leaders and frontline staff and the ways in which we identify and respond to information-related risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/7">Thirdly, the Home Office will be involved in an in-depth review of the way technology supports information flows between public protection organisations, drawing on the expertise of other departments and key organisations such as the National Policing Improvement Agency. A huge programme of work is already under way to strengthen information handling within policing and the broader criminal justice system, but we recognise the need to join up even more and sharpen the focus on public protection. There is also significant potential to save taxpayers' money through the re-use of existing technology and through reducing the amount of duplicate data held by various organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/8">Fourthly, Sir Ian has conducted some detailed work in specific areas of public protection and made recommendations that directly affect front line operations. We intend to implement these recommendations. Their focus is improving the way information is captured, stored and accessed, shared, analysed and acted upon, and managed. Full implementation of these recommendations will improve the quality of criminality information available to frontline staff who are making very difficult decisions on a day-to-day basis. In all these areas we will be building on the foundations of positive work which is already under way between the Home Office and its partners within the public protection network. For example, I anticipate we can:</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/9">work with the UK Border Agency to improve the use of criminality information to assist in deporting people in a timely and fair way; and improve the effectiveness of our vetting and barring processes so as to protect children and the vulnerable from those unsuitable to work with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/10">Working together to protect the public is the fundamental statement of purpose for the Home Office. I want that to be the guiding principle for our policies to cut crime, provide effective policing, secure our borders and protect personal identity. The effective use and sharing of criminality information is critical to the successful delivery of those policies and Sir Ian's report provides us with the framework within which that can be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/11">Copies of the documents have been placed in the Printed Paper Office and the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/1">My right honourable friend, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase> (<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-10-10.13"><I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 13-14WS</phrase>) my predecessor announced the formation of Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) and that elements of the new organisation were to be collocated in the Bath/Bristol area. DE&amp;S was established on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> and in March this year a major business improvement programme, PACE (performance, agility, confidence, efficiency), was launched to drive forward the changes required to continue to improve support to the Armed Forces both now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/3">As part of this we have concluded that additional improvements to the provision of through-life military capability and logistics support to the front line can be realised through greater consolidation of DE&amp;S business activities in Bristol. I am therefore announcing today, subject to consultation with the trades unions, the co-location of further elements of DE&amp;S at Abbey Wood in Bristol. This will involve DE&amp;S withdrawing in its entirety from Andover, Wyton, Caversfield and from both the Ensleigh and Foxhill sites in Bath, in a phased programme through to 2012. Those sites vacated by DE&amp;S are being considered for further defence use. Under the DE&amp;S programme, around 2,800 posts will move to Bristol, in addition to the 1,000 transfers already in hand. It will produce estimated savings of around &pound;560 million over a 25 year period, is a key enabler for the PACE programme and is also part of a wider departmental estates rationalisation programme, reflecting the department's commitment to maximising the funds available to support the front line.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/2">Today the Government have published the <I>End of Life Care Strategy</I>. This is the first time this country will have a long-term, comprehensive strategy for the care of adults at the end of their life. The strategy builds on the progress made over recent years and sets out a range of recommendations to deliver improvements in end-of-life care. Its aim is to deliver increased choice to all adult patients, regardless of their condition, about where they live and die and to improve care given in all settings, to patients, carers and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/3">The strategy sets out how the manifesto commitment to double investment in palliative care will be met and how choice at the end of life will be improved. It sets out the responsibilities of commissioners of end-of-life care services and of all involved in the delivery of care. It complements and supports the visions for end-of-life care developed by strategic health authorities as part of the NHS next stage review.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/4">The strategy have been placed in the Library and copies are available for honourable Members in the Vote Office.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-16a.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="73"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-wms0002.htm#80716-wms0002.htm_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.73.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning (Caroline Flint) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">I am today launching a document entitled <I>Facing the Housing Challenge: Action Today, Innovation for Tomorrow. </I>A copy will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3">We know that the vast majority of people aspire to home ownership. This is more than an economic calculation&mdash;it represents their hopes and dreams for their families. Across government, we value and support these aspirations. And we are absolutely committed to making sure that everyone can find the housing that meets their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">So this time last year, we published a housing Green Paper, setting out our plans for the biggest house-building programme in decades. It set out our long-term plans to meet the housing needs of our aging, growing population, with a major increase in supply to address increasing demand, helping those families and first-time buyers priced out of the property market.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">More recently, however, the international housing market has experienced significant challenges as a result of turbulence in the global financial markets. People are finding it harder to get a mortgage; we have seen falls in house prices and house-builders are now experiencing difficult business conditions after years of extremely favourable circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/6">But the long-term demographic trends remain the same. And without action now, we risk frustrating many more potential first-time buyers and growing families in the future. Our target to achieve a rate of 240,000 new homes per year by 2016 was set to address these long-term trends and we remain absolutely committed to increasing supply to this level to respond to this long-term demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/7">The signs are that current market conditions will lead to a fall in housing completions this year, which makes our targets of 2 million homes by 2016 and 3 million by 2020 challenging, particularly if the current conditions are protracted.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/8">However, the development industry has shown before it is capable of responding and delivering substantial increases in new homes over a short period&mdash;from around 130,000 net additions in 2001-02 to approaching 200,000 in 2006-07. We therefore remain committed to our overall target of 3 million homes by 2020 as the right long-term goal, whilst recognising the scale of the challenge this entails.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/9">We need now to retain our focus on stimulating market conditions, seeking new ways to deliver the housing this country urgently needs and ensuring there is a planning framework that will support a rapid market recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/10">So we are publishing this document to set out our next steps in this housing delivery programme, helping to strike the right balance in responding to both current conditions and long-term challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/11">We invest around &pound;6 billion per year in housing and regeneration programmes. Our priorities for these resources are to:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/12">provide greater help for first-time buyers;help existing homeowners facing difficulties due to problems in the international financial markets;keep housing supply, particularly affordable housing supply, as high as possible during the current difficulties, in order to keep on track to meet our targets; andmaintain capacity and create the right conditions for recovery and longer-term growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/13">We are therefore setting out a package of measures in this document to achieve these objectives. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/14">the pilot of a &quot;rent to homebuy&quot; scheme, led by the Housing Corporation, which will aim to help prospective buyers who are unable to take advantage of current shared ownership schemes, perhaps because they cannot find a suitable mortgage. The scheme will enable eligible households to rent a new-build property, at less than market rates, for a pre-specified period, with the option to buy a share in the home at the end of that time; plans from the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Newcastle City Council, Nottingham City Council and Manchester City Council to launch the first pilot local housing companies. These have the potential to deliver up to 10,000 new homes. They represent a new model of working which combines local authority land assets with private sector investment, enhancing delivery of new homes and communities. This represents just one of the ways that local authorities will play a central role in delivering the housing the country needs; confirmation that more funding, beyond the &pound;200 million already allocated from the affordable housing budget, could be made available to purchase high quality unsold stock, in the right locations, for the right price. This would help deliver our demanding affordable housing targets, while also supporting housebuilders;proposals to support delivery of up to 75,000 homes in 20 more towns and cities in the next stage of the growth points programme. These will combine increased housing with new jobs, town centre regeneration, and higher design and environmental standards. We will invest &pound;100 million in helping these areas to realise their ambitions for sustainable growth. Further details of the new growth points can be found in the Partnership for Growth document, being published today, which will be placed in the Library;provisional allocations of the &pound;510 million housing and planning delivery grant, to support those local authorities that are taking action to meet housing needs, and reward those that are preparing plans and identifying land supply for delivery. We will keep this under review for the next three years to ensure that it remains an effective incentive for delivery. We will also develop proposals for specific incentives to deliver affordable housing from 2010-11. Further details are set out in <I>Housing and Planning Delivery Grant: Allocation Mechanism and Summary of Consultation Responses</I>. A copy will be placed in the Library, along with the schedule of provisional allocations; a commitment to working with our stakeholders to explore the viability and practicality of mortgage rescue schemes, building on the example of local authorities and housing associations which already offer such schemes; new consumer advice and information for those concerned about mortgage repayments from the National Housing Advice Service; andthe appointment of Baroness Margaret Ford to work for Partnerships UK in identifying and releasing surplus public sector land for housing delivery, particularly land owned by central government departments and their agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/15">Alongside this document, I am publishing an open letter which sets out our response to the Callcutt review of housing supply. We have accepted a number of the recommendations from John Callcutt. These include the creation of a zero-carbon unit to co-ordinate and guide the programme of work to deliver zero-carbon housing from 2016, and further work to develop skills within the house-building industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/16">I am also publishing a summary of the Pomeroy review of private-sector shared equity. Brian Pomeroy was tasked with examining how the private-sector shared-equity market is developing and what the private and public sector might do to facilitate its development. The review found that there were no major institutional barriers which were preventing a shared equity market from developing and there remains an interest in developing suitable shared equity products when conditions improve. The full text has not been published as it contains confidential information, but the summary sets out the main findings. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/17">Finally, effective regional and local planning for the medium and long term is essential if we are to reach the target of 240 000 homes per year from 2016. We will now work with regional partners on a flexible basis to agree the work programmes and timetables with each regional planning body. The National Housing and Planning Advice Unit recently provided the Government with advice on the numbers it felt should be considered in regional strategy reviews. I am today writing to all regional assembly chairs, the North West Regional Leaders Forum, and the Mayor of London with guidance on how we expect the advice from the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit to be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/18"><I>Facing the Housing Challenge: Action Today, Innovation for Tomorrow</I> outlines a broad response to the impact of the disruption in international financial markets on the housing market. This package will both help people facing difficulties today, and lay the foundations to help meet the long-term housing needs of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/19">However, it is not the end of the process. We will review progress and reflect on new approaches, incentives or support mechanisms which will both help address the current difficulties and deliver our longer-term programme. And we will take a proactive approach wherever it is clear that we can do more to support consumers and industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State (Michael Wills) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">I am today publishing a consultation on the Information Commissioner's inspection powers and on funding the Information Commissioner's duties under the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">The Government want to ensure that the Information Commissioner has the powers and resources to continue to be able to carry out his duties under the Data Protection Act 1998 effectively, in a rapidly changing environment. Good regulation is essential to support a robust data protection framework. The use of information underpins the Government's ability to deliver benefits for the citizen through improved public services, new opportunities for the most disadvantaged, protection from crime and terrorism and sustaining economic well being.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/4">Our proposals have been informed by the<I> Data Sharing Review Report</I> published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-11">Friday 11 July</phrase>. The Government welcome the review, which provides a comprehensive look at the use and protection of personal information in today's society. I am grateful for the invaluable and thorough work that Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner, and Dr Mark Walport, of the Wellcome Trust, have done in this complex area.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/5">In October 2007, the Prime Minister invited Richard Thomas and Dr Mark Walport to undertake an independent review of the framework for the use of personal information&mdash;in both the private and public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/6">The objectives of the review were to consider whether there should be any changes to the way the Data Protection Act 1998 operates in the UK and explore options for implementing any possible changes. The review also made recommendations on the powers and sanctions available to the regulator and courts in the legislation governing data sharing and data protection, as well as how the Government should develop data sharing policy in a way that ensures proper transparency, scrutiny and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/7">I welcome the review's recommendations and agree that measures need to be taken to increase public trust and confidence in the handling and processing of personal data by Government and the private sector. The Government will consider how best to take forward the remaining recommendations and they will respond in detail in autumn 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/8">Copies of the consultation will be made available in the Libraries of both Houses the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. It is also available on the internet at: <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/cp1508.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/cp1508.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (David Hanson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/2">I am, with my right honourable friend the Minister of State, Department for Children Schools and Families (Beverley Hughes), announcing the national targets for reducing adult and youth reoffending. Our new challenging targets will help drive a focus across government on those offenders who commit the highest number of offences and cause the most damage to communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/3">The new national targets are:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/4">to reduce the adult reoffending rate by 10 per cent between 2005 and 2011; and to reduce the youth reoffending rate by 10 per cent between 2005 and 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/5">(The reoffending rate is defined as the number of reoffences per 100 offenders (frequency)).</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/6">These targets demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to tackling reoffending. For adult offenders, this commitment has seen a 7.4 per cent reduction in the number of reoffenders compared to a predicted rate, and an 11.4 per cent fall in the frequency rate of reoffending between 2000 and 2005. For juvenile reoffenders, while the number of reoffenders has remained stable, we have seen a 17.4 per cent fall in the frequency rate of reoffending between 2000 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/7">These targets underpin an indicator in the <I>Make Communities Safer</I> public service agreement, published last year, which set out how we will work to reduce adult and youth reoffending and reduce crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/8">The new targets will continue to focus partners across government and beyond to work together to reduce reoffending. We will continue to provide support for those offenders who are trying to change and turn away from offending, but for those offenders unwilling to change, the targets provide renewed emphasis of the need to catch and convict them as speedily and efficiently as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/9"><I>Spending Review 2002 target</I></p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/10">We will report our performance against the 2002 spending review target to reduce reoffending by 5 per cent by 2006 when the 2006 data become available.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/2">Roads are vital to our way of life, connecting people with jobs, schools, shops, family and friends. We must ensure that road users have reliable journeys on safe, well-managed roads. So today I am publishing the Command Paper <I>Roads</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Delivering Choice and Reliability</I> which sets out how we aim to get the best out of the road network.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/3">The greatest barrier to reliable journeys is congestion. It is frustrating for motorists and has serious consequences for the economy and the environment. So we are taking a number of important steps to tackle it, focusing our efforts over the next decade on where congestion is worst&mdash;on our urban roads and motorways.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/4">I am today announcing that &pound;6 billion is available to fund improvements to national strategic roads in England in the period up to 2014. These improvements could include an innovative mix of road widening, opening up the hard shoulder, and junction improvements. In the Command Paper I set out which national schemes are being considered for this funding, which is in addition to that for strategic regional roads provided through the regional funding allocation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/5">While some road building is needed to provide extra capacity, we must also consider how to add capacity to existing roads. That is why I am exploring where the hard shoulder could be used to provide extra space on the motorway network. Where we add new capacity either by using the hard shoulder, or by widening roads, I am particularly interested to see what role tolled or car-share lanes could play to give motorists a more reliable journey. Further work will be done on this in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/6">I am also today publishing cost estimates for the Highways Agency major roads programme. Since the Nichols review last year, the Highways Agency has made some important changes to its management of the roads programme. These changes are outlined in the Command Paper. The revised cost estimates for regional schemes will help the regions plan their programmes more effectively over the coming regional funding allocation period. I am placing a copy of the estimates in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/7">The majority of congestion is in our towns and cities so we have allocated an extra &pound;200 million per year from the transport innovation fund to help local authorities manage congestion in innovative ways. I am announcing today that further pump-priming funding will go to Cambridgeshire, Reading and Leeds to help them take forward their ideas. I have also previously announced that, to help local authorities with their thinking on congestion charging, we will run a demonstrations project to trial the technology and processes that could underpin a more sophisticated future congestion charging system. My department will today tell all those companies that formally expressed an interest in participating in the project the names of the successful bidders. The trials are due to start in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/8">I am also today announcing that eight of the 10 largest urban areas in England, that all have congestion targets, will receive the first tranche of the performance-related payments from the urban congestion performance fund. The fund is worth &pound;60 million over four years and, based on their 2006-07 target performance data, &pound;6 million will be shared between Bristol, Greater Manchester, Leicester, London, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear and the West Midlands. All 10 areas will be eligible for further funding based on future years' performance data. This funding, along with an additional &pound;8 million I am announcing today to help local authorities manage their transport assets more effectively, on top of &pound;15 million already announced in January, is all in addition to the amounts provided through the regional funding allocation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/9">It is important that people have the reliable journeys they want. The Command Paper I am publishing today sets out a clear strategy for getting the best out of our roads in the coming years so we can make that a reality.</p>

	Society Lotteries
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-16a.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="79"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80716-wms0003.htm#80716-wms0003.htm_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.79.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Gerry Sutcliffe) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/2">In recent months my department has received representations from the Lotteries Council and the Hospice Lotteries Association, seeking changes to the regulatory regime for non-commercial society lotteries established by Section 99 of the Gambling Act 2005 (&quot;the Act&quot;). Societies under the Act are typically national and local charities, sporting and social clubs that run lottery draws in order to raise funds for local good causes such as hospices or air ambulances. Societies which operate lotteries that raise more than &pound;20,000 in a single draw or over &pound;250,000 in a year must be licensed by the Gambling Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/3">The aim of the representations I have received has been to persuade the Government to increase the present limit on the maximum proceeds which are permitted to be raised by society lotteries in a single draw, from the present limit of &pound;2 million. This would also allow a larger top prize to be offered, since the Act provides that a person buying a society lottery ticket cannot win more than 10 per cent of the overall proceeds of the draw.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/4">These representations have been echoed in Parliament. Through signing Early Day Motion 1570 tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1431" name="David Crausby">the honourable Member for Bolton North East (Mr David Crausby)</phrase> in May this year, 70 honourable Members on all sides have expressed support for an increase in proceeds limits under the Act, specifically in relation to hospice lotteries.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/5">While very few societies currently reach the present limits, some have argued that the limits hold them back, for example by preventing a number of societies coming together to promote a larger one-off annual draw.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/6">The Government have always been willing to consider representations made on behalf of the good causes which benefit from society lotteries, as we showed when we doubled the then society lottery limits in 2002. The 2005 Act also introduced a range of deregulatory measures designed to assist society lotteries. I have considered the arguments now put by the Lotteries Council and Hospice Lotteries Council, as well as the views of honourable Members. I have also taken into account the view of the Gambling Commission, which, as the Government's principal adviser on gambling matters, has also recommended an increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/7">I have had to balance these arguments for increasing the amount which society lotteries can raise for projects with my responsibility for ensuring that the licensing objectives of the Gambling Act are observed. There is a significant risk that increasing the limit on proceeds of lottery draws, and hence the top prize available, by too great an amount could significantly change the character of a society lottery by appealing to players for whom winning such a prize would be a greater attraction than supporting the charitable cause in question. Very high prizes also bring with them an increased risk of fraud and other criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/8">Having weighed these considerations, I have concluded that there is a reasonable justification for a limited increase in the maximum proceeds that society lotteries may raise in a single lottery draw. I am now able to inform the House how the Government intend to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/9">I will tomorrow publish a three-month consultation paper on a proposal to increase to &pound;4 million the maximum proceeds for each individual society lottery draw. This will entail a top prize of up to &pound;400,000 for each draw. There will be no increase to the annual maximum proceeds per society lottery of &pound;10 million since no society lotteries presently reach that limit. The maximum &pound;25,000 prize for society lotteries whose proceeds are below &pound;250,000 will also remain unaltered.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/10">If in the light of public consultation we decide to proceed, either with this proposal or another that suggests itself in the light of responses to the consultation, we will bring forward the necessary order. This will be for Parliament to approve by means of an affirmative resolution, requiring a debate and potentially a vote in both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.1/11">This measure would benefit around 630 societies which are presently licensed by the Gambling Commission to operate society lotteries. I believe that it would provide a valuable boost to hospices, charities and other good causes which raise funds through lottery draws, whilst retaining the character of society lotteries and remaining wholly consistent with the licensing objectives of the Act.</p>
