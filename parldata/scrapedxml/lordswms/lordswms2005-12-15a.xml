	Coal Health Compensation Schemes

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-12-15a.137.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="137"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51215-52.htm#51215-53_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.137.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" name="Malcolm Wicks">My honourable friend the Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/2">I announced in my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="">21 July</phrase> that I was setting up an independent external review of the handling of the department's coal health compensation schemes. This followed a series of press articles raising concerns about various aspects of the schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/3">The terms of reference for the review were: to review the integrity of the administration of the scheme for dealing with coal health claims and to identify any specific measures needed to improve the administration of the scheme; to consider whether there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent, detect and pursue fraud while ensuring the fair and timely settlement of claims; and to make recommendations accordingly to Ministers and/or the accounting officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/4">The review was undertaken by a team led by Stephen Boys Smith, a former senior official at the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/5">I am publishing today the report of the review. I have placed the report in the Libraries of both Houses and it is available on the department's website (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/coalhealth">www.dti.gov.uk/coalhealth</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/6">I am grateful to Stephen Boys Smith and the review team for producing a focused report on what are complicated issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/7">The coal schemes were initially set up to discharge very substantial liabilities, inherited by my department from British Coal, for industrial injuries suffered by miners. In total we estimate they will result in payment to miners and their estates of up to &pound;5 billion in compensation. We are about half way through the schemes and more than &pound;2.8 billion has been paid out in compensation so far. As the report notes, and as Members in coal mining constituencies will be aware, significant sums have been paid out in the coal areas equivalent to around 3.5 per cent of local annual income. Current expenditure is nearly &pound;2 million a day.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/8">In short, I think that the Government are fully facing up to their obligations to discharge these liabilities. Given the scale of the task, it is important that there is confidence that the schemes are being well run. I am therefore pleased to take from the report the assurance that: the administration of the schemes is basically sound although there are lessons to be learnt about how the schemes were put into operation; that, aside from continuing efficiency improvements, no major changes are needed to improve the running of the schemes; and that the fraud procedures in place are appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/9">The report also rejects the argument that the UDM was granted more favourable terms over other parties and confirms that arrangements with the UDM effectively provided identical compensation to that under the agreements with the claimants group.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/10">The report also makes a number of specific recommendations. The department fully accepts those recommendations which are directed at it and will follow them through in the months ahead. I will report to the House as appropriate on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/11">I wish to comment at this point, however, on the report's specific conclusions and recommendations in three areas: namely, the initial design of the scheme; the issue of the costs of administering the scheme, including legal costs; and the issue of transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/12">On the basic design of the schemes, the report concludes that the arrangements put in place in the late 1990s were not the best way to administer compensation for so many people; and it goes on to recommend that, were a similar case to arise in future, the Government &quot;should very carefully examine alternative ways of proceeding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/13">I agree with this recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/14">When the basic groundwork for the current schemes was put in place in the late 1990s, no one knew that we would have anything like as many as 700,000 claims under the schemes; and, in particular, that we would have so many relatively low value claims. The existing schemes are now well established and we have introduced radical changes to the lung disease scheme in the past 12 months to speed up the processing of significant numbers of claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/15">Any further substantive changes to the existing schemes would run the risk of delaying the payment of claims which would be to no one's benefit. Moreover, given that we are in the last few years of the current schemes, now is not the time for further redesign. But were we to face such circumstances again, we would undoubtedly want to think long and hard about whether there are better alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/16">The second key issue which the report raises is the question of costs and solicitors' costs in particular. In commenting on this, I should first make clear the considerable contribution to the running of the scheme that has been made by the various firms of solicitors involved. The schemes are complex; and it is entirely right and proper that miners and their families should have professional legal support through this process, funded by the Government under the legal obligations we inherited from British Coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/17">But the report nonetheless points out that the legal cost structures were largely negotiated, along with the agreements themselves, at a time when the anticipated volumes of cases under the schemes were considerably lower than has proved to be the case. It would be wrong not to recognise that higher than anticipated volumes of cases undoubtedly bring opportunities for batch processing and reduced costs per case. The report also notes that not every claim will always require the assistance of qualified legal professionals and that the cost to public funds &quot;does not now necessarily reflect the more routine nature of the work&quot;. The report recommends, therefore, that we consider whether there is more to be done in this area, with the aim of ensuring that legal costs more accurately reflect the nature of the work actually undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/18">This is an issue the department is already actively pursuing. In particular, we believe that the new &quot;fast-track&quot; approach we have implemented this year for the lung disease scheme should require significantly less input by solicitors and should therefore incur considerably reduced costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/19">We have argued that case with the solicitors' representatives and, indeed, before the High Court. We have now taken the issue to the Court of Appeal. I do not think it appropriate to comment in detail at this stage. But significant sums in legal costs&mdash;perhaps up to &pound;200 million of taxpayers' money&mdash;are at stake.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/20">There are also other areas where we have yet to reach agreement with the claimants' solicitors on costs and we will be pursuing these equally vigorously to ensure they reflect work done and a reasonable level of return.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/21">More generally, I regret that legal costs have become the source of such contention. It is right that solicitors are properly rewarded for the work they have done. But claimants' representatives will recognise that it does no good whatever to the reputation of themselves or their profession if they are perceived in the press and elsewhere, rightly or wrongly, as being primarily motivated by fee earning opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/22">In this context, the report also discusses the concern that in some cases solicitors have taken money from claimants' compensation to cover costs even though legal costs are met by the Government, and that, again in some cases, union fees have been deducted from compensation. Both issues are discussed in the report in some detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/23">Clearly, it would be wholly unacceptable for deductions to be made from any compensation payment without the claimant's agreement, though the report notes that, as far as they were aware, there were no examples of that happening. But the report equally suggests that in some cases, claimants appear to have been invited to agree to make such contributions without it being crystal clear to them that such donations were a matter for their choice and that other solicitors would not seek to make them. That would strike me, to say the least, as questionable.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/24">These are essentially matters about conduct within the legal profession and the department has no direct role. We have, however, raised the issues with the Law Society in the past and will continue to make clear to them the importance of taking these issues forward rigorously and proactively. There is again legal action in prospect, though not involving the department. The report does, however, make a specific recommendation that, subject to the outcome of any legal action in this area, the legal profession should take forward the issue of claimants who were not made fully aware that they were free to use solicitors who did not make any deductions. The report calls on the legal profession to take this forward. I urge it to do so and I will follow up this issue with the Law Society.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/25">Thirdly, we have also taken steps immediately to address the recommendation about greater availablity of information about the schemes. We have already put on the website (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/coalhealth/">http://www.dti.gov.uk/coalhealth/</a>) the claims handling agreements, including the UDM agreements, and the latest reports to the courts on progress of the schemes, which cover a lot of detail. We will consider what further information might be added and would welcome input from interested parties about what additional information they would find helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/26">Although it is not dealt with within the report, I can also report separately to the House that the Serious Fraud Office has now confirmed to my department that, while its investigations are continuing, its investigation is not now focusing on any suspected fraud against the department.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.1/1">The Prime Minister has today published the Government's response to the 10th report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life <i>Getting the Balance Right: Implementing Standards of Conduct in Public Life</i>. The Government have considered the committee's report with great care, and we would like to place on record our thanks to the committee for its thorough consideration of these issues. Our response to the main recommendations is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/2" class="italic">Ethical Standards Framework for Local Government</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/3">We consider that a move to a more locally based process for considering misconduct allegations against local government members, along the lines recommended by the committee, would be the most appropriate way of addressing local issues and ensuring the local ownership of standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/4">To maintain a culture of good conduct and provide strategic support to enable councillors to manage conduct issues effectively, we feel there is an essential, continuing role for the Standards Board for England in supporting high standards locally, as also recommended by the committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/5" class="italic">Public Appointments</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/6">The Government accept the committee's recommendation that more systematic information should be published by departments on their overall policy and approach to public appointments. The Cabinet Office will work with departments to ensure a more consistent approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/7">The Government also recognise the important role of independent assessors in the process and believe that the accreditation of independent assessors should be given further consideration by the commissioner in consultation with the Cabinet Office and departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/8">The Government are also attracted to the committee's recommendation for a Board of Public Appointments Commissioners, and for individual commissioners to each be linked to a small number of departments. However, such a proposal will have cost implications and the Government would therefore welcome the views of the Public Administration Select Committee, which is currently carrying out an inquiry into the role and independence of the ethical regulators of government.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/9">Copies of the Government's response [Cm 6723] have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" name="Alun Michael">My right honourable friend the Minister for Industry and the Regions (Alun Michael)</phrase> has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/2">The Chancellor announced on <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> that the Government had decided no longer to require quoted companies to prepare an operating and financial review, in addition to the requirements of the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/3">I am today laying regulations which repeal the requirement on quoted companies to prepare an operating and financial review for financial years starting on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. They will need to include a business review as part of the directors' Report, in compliance with the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive requirements. This is in line with the Government's general policy not to impose regulatory requirements on UK businesses over and above relevant EU directive requirements. I am today publishing guidance on the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/4">We are committed to improving strategic, forward-looking narrative reporting by companies, and to enhanced dialogue with shareholders based on such reporting. We believe it is important for companies to report on non-financial issues relevant to the development and performance of the business, including, for example, environmental matters and human capital management, and they will need to do so under the business review requirements. The business review will need to cover principal risks and uncertainties as well as giving a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/5">The contents of the business review cover much of the ground covered in the operating and financial review, but in less prescriptive form. The depth of analysis required is proportionate to the size and complexity of the business. A small company (namely, one which satisfies two of the following: turnover of not more than &pound;5.6 million; balance sheet total of not more than &pound;2.8 million; not more than 50 employees) need provide no such review. Also, the business review does not have the additional audit requirement specified for the OFR.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/6">Companies that have been preparing to produce an OFR will be able to use that work to produce their business review. In addition, many companies have been producing a voluntary OFR for some years, and may wish to continue doing so using work that they have done toward the mandatory OFR. Or they may use that work to improve the quality and depth of their business review.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/7">The Government also believe that disclosures&mdash;both mandatory and voluntary&mdash;are only part of the picture. On their own, disclosures are insufficient to generate responses by businesses to the legitimate concerns of civil society. Dialogue with and pressure from stakeholders, including the public, NGOs, shareholders and government, is vital for achieving this outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/8">In order to have the maximum impact, it is important that the requirements for narrative reporting are properly calibrated, and neither impose an excessive compliance burden, nor push companies into a &quot;tick box&quot; or &quot;boilerplate&quot; approach to disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/9">As regards enforcement of the business review requirements, the Financial Reporting and Review Panel has the legal authority to review a company's directors' report, for financial years beginning on or after <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase> and, if necessary, go to the court to compel a company to revise its report.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/10">The Company Law Reform Bill contains provisions relating to the operating and financial review. We intend to bring forward amendments to remove the need for a quoted company to produce an operating and financial review. In future such a company will have to produce a business review. I am today inviting views from interested parties by <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase> before we bring forward appropriate amendments to the Bill.</p>

My right honourable friend the Prime Minister made a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">11 July</phrase> in which he outlined the successful outcomes of the Gleneagles Summit and the real benefits G8 Leaders committed to, including delivering an additional $25 billion in annual aid to Africa by 2010 and agreement on a process to tackle climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.3/2">I am now able to release the organisational costs of this summit. Based on the final invoices and accounts received from our suppliers, as well as prudent estimates where final figures are not yet available, the organisational cost of the summit was &pound;12.7 million.

	<p pid="a.151.3/1">The judicial pension schemes are mainly governed by the Judicial Pensions Act 1981 and the Judicial Pensions Act 1993.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/2">I have concluded that, as administrator of the judicial pension schemes, it would be in the best interests of the members that, for the future, the schemes should not be registered schemes for the purposes of the Finance Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/3">The principal effect will be that lump sum benefits payable from, and members contributions payable to, the schemes will cease to attract tax relief from <phrase class="date" code="">6 April 2006</phrase>. Income tax will, of course, also continue to be payable on pension benefits. Judicial pension benefits will consequentially not be taken into account for the purposes of the registered pension schemes provisions of the Finance Act 2004 as they will not receive the preferential tax treatment afforded to such schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/4">I also propose to make provision for judges to receive a long service award which will become payable when they near retirement. The level of the award, which will be a proportion of the lump sum, will reflect their years of service and their judicial grade and will ensure that their net position is maintained. I will amend judicial terms and conditions to reflect this proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/5">There will be an adjustment to the rate of contributions for dependants' benefits and certain technical changes to the schemes needed to reflect the terms of the Finance Act will be made under powers contained in that Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/6">I am satisfied that these proposals are in accordance with the terms of the Finance Act 2004. They serve to maintain but not improve the overall remuneration package for the serving judiciary and to protect the principle of judicial independence in so doing. There will be no net cost to the Exchequer. In these circumstances, it is not necessary for me to introduce separate legislation for judicial pensions and I do not therefore propose to proceed with the Bill which was announced in May this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.1/1">My right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/2">I have published this week <i>Health reform in England: update and next steps</i>. Copies have been placed in the Library. The document describes the framework for reform of the National Health Service in England, re-states the rationale for reform and explains how the reforms will be mutually reinforcing. It summarises the initiatives already announced and lays out a programme of further policy development for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/3">It is the first in a series of publications building on the commitment in <i>Creating a Patient-led NHS </i>to explain how the whole reform programme fits together. It shows how the reforms offer a real opportunity to provide a better service to patients and the public, enabling the people working in the NHS to make the most of their skills and commitment.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.3/1">Last year, my right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Jack Straw) and the then Chief Secretary of the Treasury (Mr. Paul Boateng) asked Lord Carter of Coles to assess the impact of publicly funded public diplomacy activities and to make recommendations. He delivered his report to us earlier in the week. I have placed copies of the report in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.3/2">The key recommendation is that main public diplomacy partners&mdash;the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, British Council and BBC World Service&mdash;work more closely together in support of a new, operational Public Diplomacy Board. This board will be responsible for the development of a focused, three-to-five year strategy in support of the Government's medium to long term priorities for our public diplomacy effort overseas. The report includes recommendations for better evaluation of our public diplomacy activities, increased support for foreign press based in London, and for a further assessment of the role that television and new technologies can play in public diplomacy delivery. It also outlines the important role that the Department for International Development, Ministry of Defence, UK Trade and Investment, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the devolved Administrations and VisitBritain have to play in broadening the scope of our public diplomacy while acknowledging that the scope of their involvement is, at present, different in degree from that of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the BBC World Service and the British Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.3/3">I welcome Lord Carter of Coles' findings and propose to begin discussions immediately with our public diplomacy partners, particularly the British Council and the BBC World Service, on how best to implement his recommendations.</p>
