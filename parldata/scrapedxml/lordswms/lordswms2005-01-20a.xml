	National Offender Management Service: Drug Strategy
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-01-20a.29.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="29"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050120/text/50120-42.htm#50120-42_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.29.5/1">We are today announcing the launch of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) drug strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/2">In line with the Government's national drug strategy 2002, NOMS has developed a comprehensive strategy for the management and treatment of problematic drug users throughout the correctional services. The strategy is based on extensive consultation with key stakeholders and has been informed by evidence-based research. This strategy complements the alcohol strategy for prisoners that was launched in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/3">The NOMS drug strategy draws together existing and planned drug interventions and the wider support available for drug-misusers both in custody and in the community. The strategy will help create an individual focus to interventions, lower the level of harm that misusers cause themselves and others, and reduce the supply and demand of illicit drugs in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/4">The strategy, which fits squarely with the work already under way with the Government's drug interventions programme, will help support the Home Office target of reducing reoffending by reinforcing the end-to-end case management processes that are being adopted throughout NOMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/5">It is essential that effective drug treatment&mdash;as envisaged under this strategy&mdash;continues to form part of the overall offender management process. Benefiting from NOMS's enhanced offender management arrangements, the strategy will see improvements in the continuity of care, with a focus on an individual's handover at critical transition points in the criminal justice system&mdash;including when released on licence and upon completion of sentence. This in turn will support effective resettlement and reintegration into society.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/6">There are an estimated 250,000 to 280,000 problematic drug users in the United Kingdom. At any one time around a third&mdash;80,000&mdash;are serving custodial or community sentences. This underlines the pivotal role that NOMS has to play in the delivery of drug treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.5/7">A copy of the strategy is available in the Library.</p>
