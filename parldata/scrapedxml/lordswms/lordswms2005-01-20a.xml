	<p pid="a.29.3/2">The Government have received and welcomed the third report from the Justice Oversight Commissioner, the right honourable Lord Clyde, on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the <i>Review of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland</i>. Consistent with his terms of reference, the report was submitted to the Attorney-General, Baroness Ashton, Minister for the Northern Ireland Court Service, and me in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.3/3">Lord Clyde concludes that the position overall is one of solid progress continuing to be made over the whole range of the work. Whilst some few areas of delay have been identified, as more and more of the particular elements of the whole package of reforms begin to fall into place, the picture of the new system of criminal justice is beginning to emerge and the overall progress towards that end remains commendable. The Government warmly endorse these conclusions.</p>

	National Offender Management Service: Drug Strategy
</major-heading>

	<p pid="a.30.5/1">We are today announcing the launch of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) drug strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/2">In line with the Government's national drug strategy 2002, NOMS has developed a comprehensive strategy for the management and treatment of problematic drug users throughout the correctional services. The strategy is based on extensive consultation with key stakeholders and has been informed by evidence-based research. This strategy complements the alcohol strategy for prisoners that was launched in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/3">The NOMS drug strategy draws together existing and planned drug interventions and the wider support available for drug-misusers both in custody and in the community. The strategy will help create an individual focus to interventions, lower the level of harm that misusers cause themselves and others, and reduce the supply and demand of illicit drugs in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/4">The strategy, which fits squarely with the work already under way with the Government's drug interventions programme, will help support the Home Office target of reducing reoffending by reinforcing the end-to-end case management processes that are being adopted throughout NOMS.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/5">It is essential that effective drug treatment&mdash;as envisaged under this strategy&mdash;continues to form part of the overall offender management process. Benefiting from NOMS's enhanced offender management arrangements, the strategy will see improvements in the continuity of care, with a focus on an individual's handover at critical transition points in the criminal justice system&mdash;including when released on licence and upon completion of sentence. This in turn will support effective resettlement and reintegration into society.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/6">There are an estimated 250,000 to 280,000 problematic drug users in the United Kingdom. At any one time around a third&mdash;80,000&mdash;are serving custodial or community sentences. This underlines the pivotal role that NOMS has to play in the delivery of drug treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.5/7">A copy of the strategy is available in the Library.</p>

	Gulf War 1990&ndash;91: Veterans' Mortality Data
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2005-01-20a.31.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="31"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050120/text/50120-42.htm#50120-42_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.31.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/2">As part of the Government's continuing commitment to openness and transparency on Gulf veterans' illnesses I am today publishing the regular data on the mortality of veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict. The most recent figures for the period <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-01">1 April 1991</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase> were published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-17">17 January 2005</phrase>. The tables from that publication are set out below. Table 1 gives the causes of death to UK Gulf veterans over that period; table 2 shows the deaths due to neoplasms (cancers) among Gulf veterans.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/3">As with previous information, the data for Gulf veterans are compared to those of a control group known as the Era cohort which is made up of Armed Forces personnel of a similar profile in terms of gender, service, regular/reservist status and rank, who were not deployed to the Gulf. Subsequent to the previous release of this data, further examination of trends in some cause-groups has revealed differences between the Gulf and Era cohort age groups: although each Era cohort age group was randomly sampled to be the same size as the corresponding Gulf cohort age group, those who were aged 40 years or over on <phrase class="date" code="1991-01-01">1 January 1991</phrase> who deployed to the Gulf were often younger than those sampled for the Era cohort. All figures for the Era cohort have therefore been adjusted to the single years of age structure of the Gulf cohort, as at <phrase class="date" code="1991-01-01">1 January 1991</phrase>, to ensure appropriate comparisons. The main impact is slightly to reduce the previously noticed excess of deaths in the Era cohort caused by disease-related conditions, and cancer in particular, increasing the similarity between the two cohorts. The effect on accidental deaths is minimal.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/2">A consultative document seeking views on the Government's proposals for implementing the EU directive on takeover bids has been published today. Copies are available in the Library and on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/current.htm">www.dti.gov.uk/cld/current.htm</a>. The deadline for comments is <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-15">15 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/3">The consultative document reflects the Government's view that our existing system of takeover regulation overseen by the Takeover Panel has many strengths and enjoys the confidence of business. In order to minimise disruption to the current regime, the Government have therefore concluded that the panel should retain responsibility for takeover regulation and that a central objective in implementing the directive should be to build on the strengths of the existing system.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/4">In order to comply with the requirements of the directive this will require the panel being given powers to make statutory rules whilst retaining scope to determine its own constitutional and operational framework. The consultative document explains the issues to which this gives rise and how the Government propose to deal with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/5">Primary legislation making the necessary provisions to implement the directive on this basis will be introduced when parliamentary time allows.</p>
