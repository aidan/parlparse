	Cabinet Office: Spring Supplementary Estimate 2005&ndash;06
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-02-09b.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60209-53.htm#60209-53_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.47.1/1">Subject to parliamentary approval of any necessary supplementary estimate, the Cabinet Office DEL will be decreased by &pound;3,150,000 from &pound;226,144,000 to &pound;222,994,000. The administration cost limits will be decreased by &pound;3,570,000 from &pound;199,401,000 to &pound;195,831,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/2">Within the DEL change, the impact on resources and capital is as, set out in the following table.</p>
	<table>
		<caption>New DEL</caption>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.47.1/6"> <td>&pound;'000</td> <td>Change</td> <td>Voted</td> <td>Non-voted</td> <td>Total</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.47.1/7"> <td>Resource</td> <td>-3,150</td> <td>222,994</td> <td>0</td> <td>222,994</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.47.1/8"> <td>Capital</td> <td>-1,687</td> <td>23,313</td> <td>0</td> <td>23,313</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.47.1/9"> <td>Depreciation*</td> <td>0</td> <td>-37,338</td> <td>0</td> <td>-37,338</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.47.1/10"> <td>Total</td> <td>-4,837</td> <td>208,969</td> <td>0</td> <td>208,969</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.47.1/13">*Depreciation, which forms part of resource DEL, is excluded from the total DEL since capital DEL includes capital spending and to include depreciation of those assets would lead to double counting.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/14">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from machinery of government (MoG) transfer of the Government Social Research Unit to HM Treasury and the Whips' Offices (Lords and Commons) to the Privy Council Office. The resource implications are &pound;2,097,000 and &pound;914,000 respectively. Other outward transfers include the baseline for the Parliamentary Counsel Office to other government departments. Inward transfers include &pound;3,890,000 from the Department of Trade and Industry to fund the equalities review, &pound;335,000 from various government departments to fund protective security measures relating to state and government assets in central London and end-year flexibility drawdown of &pound;7,900,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/15">The change in the capital element of the DEL arises from the transfer of &pound;20,000 capital as part of the MoG transfer to the Privy Counsel Office and &pound;1,110,000 as part of the MoG transfer of Government Car and Despatch Agency to the Department for Transport. There is also a transfer of &pound;557,000 to Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre for the provision of a new building and infrastructure at Hanslope Park.</p>

	<p pid="b.48.1/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July 2005</phrase> Lord Carter of Coles has led a review of legal aid procurement. Today Lord Carter published his interim report, <i>Procurement of Criminal Defence Services: A Market Based Approach to Reform</i>. I am very grateful to Lord Carter for the excellent progress he has made. I am also grateful for the continuing support and active engagement with the Carter team that both the Bar Council and Law Society have given. I am looking forward to Lord Carter's final report containing a worked-through and fully costed implementation plan for delivering a procurement system that achieves maximum value for money and control over spending, while insuring quality and fairness of the justice system.</p>
