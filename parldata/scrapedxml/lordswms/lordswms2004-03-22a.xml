	Draft Regional Transport Strategy for the South-East
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-03-22a.29.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="29"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040322/text/40322-48.htm#40322-48_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.29.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister is today publishing for public consultation proposed changes to the draft regional transport strategy (RTS) for the south-east. They follow the public examination into the draft RTS in July 2003 and the panel report in October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/3">RTSs are an integral part of regional planning guidance (RPG) and the draft RTS for the south-east represents a revision to RPG9, as published in March 2001. On commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill the RTS will be part of a statutory regional spatial strategy (RSS).</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/4">Other partial reviews of RPG9 are at various stages in the process. In particular, a public examination into the Milton Keynes and South Midlands sub-regional strategy is imminent, and the Secretary of State's proposed changes for the Ashford growth area will shortly be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/5">The RTS aims to achieve a transport system which progressively reaches the standards of the best in north-west Europe by promoting management of and investment in the system; rebalancing the structure and use of the transport system in favour of more sustainable modes; and supporting the regional spatial strategy, particularly managing and investing in interregional corridors and delivering urban renaissance and sub-regional objectives. This approach should also inform local authorities and other agencies in preparing relevant regional and local strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/6">Overall the panel considered the draft RTS to be broadly compatible with RPG9, with commendably focussed policies. The panel did, however, recommend many changes. Aspects of the strategy which the panel proposed changes to include the selection of strategic corridors (the regional frame), the ranking of priority projects in the investment frameworks, car parking standards, community and demand-based transport, and walking and cycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/7">The panel supported the identification and development of regional transport hubs and connecting spokes as a core plank in the strategy. In place of the regional frame the panel identified the region's more important international gateways and interregional movement corridors. Alongside measures to facilitate urban renewal these elements were viewed as priorities for investment to deliver the spatial strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/8">The Government support these aims and are grateful for the recommendations of the panel. However, one change to the panel's recommendations is necessary to ensure the strategy and its components are more coherently focussed and provide transparent direction for the future development of the regional strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/9">A key issue for the region is the treatment of priorities. The panel proposed a priority list of 15 schemes, made up of nine heavy rail, one light rail, two bus and three road schemes. While we view establishing regional priorities as a key element in a future RTS, we were unconvinced that the panel identified the most important regional priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/10">More specifically, the criteria used to identify priorities and the way in which the criteria were applied did not fully reflect the draft government guidance, which was published after the examination concluded. Furthermore, the application of the criteria was not transparent and resulted in a priority list that was largely focussed on a single mode and failed to identify affordability issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/11">The process of comprehensively reviewing RPG9 has already begun. As part of this work the regional assembly (RA) is intent on improving the evidence base by developing a robust approach to prioritisation, an activity that I am particularly keen to see progress on.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/12">I have today written to the RA with the proposed changes indicating areas where views are particularly sought from interested parties. There will now be a public consultation period on the proposed changes, which will end on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-21">21 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/13">Copies of the relevant documents are available in the Libraries of the House and have been provided for all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>

	Health Services for Prisoners
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-03-22a.31.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="31"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040322/text/40322-49.htm#40322-49_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.31.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/2">I am making this Statement with my honourable Friend the Minister for Correctional Services and Reducing Reoffending, Mr Paul Goggins.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/3">The prison population demonstrates high levels of morbidity, particularly in areas such as mental health and substance misuse. Historically, primary healthcare services to prisoners have been secured and delivered by the Prison Service independently of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/4">A formal partnership between the Prison Service and the NHS was launched in 2000 to modernise health services for prisoners. In 2002, the Government announced their intention to move this partnership on to a new phase, with the Department of Heath assuming overall financial responsibility for these services from April 2003 and the transfer of full commissioning responsibility for prison health services to NHS PCTs by April 2006. A development network of prisons and PCTs was established to provide a testbed for this transfer at operational level.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/5">We are today announcing the NHS primary care trusts that will assume responsibility for commissioning primary healthcare services in their local prisons from April 2004. This is the initial phase of transfer of responsibility and involves 22 PCTs which have prisons within their boundaries. Of these 22, four have delegated commissioning responsibility to neighbouring PCTs, giving 18 PCTs the lead for local prison health partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/6">Covering 34 prisons across England, the 18 lead primary care trusts have demonstrated a clear understanding of the health needs of their local prison populations and have, in partnership with the prisons themselves, developed robust plans to improve health services for those populations. Funding for primary health services that was previously allocated through the Prison Service will be transferred to the relevant primary care trusts from April 2004. Funding for NHS secondary care services provided to prisoners is already within the financial baselines of PCTs. Investment in health services for prisoners is set to increase by over &pound;40 million a year over the three-year period to March 2006. Responsibility for commissioning health services in all publicly run prisons in England will transfer to local primary care trusts by 1 Apri1 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/7">The 18 partnerships where commissioning responsibility will transfer from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April</phrase> are:</p>
