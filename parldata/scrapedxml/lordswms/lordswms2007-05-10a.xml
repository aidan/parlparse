	<p pid="a.68.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Patricia Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/2">Today, the department is publishing a report from the Chief Nursing Officer on progress with mixed-sex accommodation in hospitals. This report highlights the actions the National Health Service should take to improve the provision of single-sex accommodation, and includes practical advice for trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/3">The chief executive of the NHS, David Nicholson, has reiterated our commitment to single-sex accommodation by including it in the operating framework for the NHS for 2007-08. In addition, strategic health authorities (SHAs) have been askedto review performance in this area, and have been working with a number of trusts to agree plans for improvement. SHAs are also publishing statements today on the position in their region.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.1/4">Patients expect the NHS to deliver high standards of privacy and dignity that include, but are not restricted to, single-sex accommodation. Single-sex accommodation should be the norm in elective care, and remains the ideal for emergency treatment. However, we recognise that sometimes the need to treat and admit must take priority&mdash;the NHS will not turn a patient away just because a &quot;right sex&quot; bed is not immediately available.</p>
