	Defra: Laboratory Strategy
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-07-14b.47.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050714/text/50714-39.htm#50714-39_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.47.3/1">I have agreed to the future direction of Defra's laboratory strategy, which aims to deliver a long term sustainable future for Defra's laboratories: the Central Science Laboratory (CSL), the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS).</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/2">Defra's laboratories have an international reputation for excellence. They play an important role for Defra by providing scientific capacity and the evidence base for policy development. Defra will continue to rely on the support they provide, so it is important that the strategy delivers a sustainable future for their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/3">A new group, the Laboratories Strategy Group (LSG) has been formed to develop and oversee the programme of work necessary to take the strategy forward. The LSG is chaired by Lynton Barker (non-executive) and reports to Defra's management board.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.3/4">As part of the laboratory strategy, Defra is working with the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) on a joint study to consider the future relationship between VLA and the Institute of Animal Health (IAH). Objectives of the study are to achieve financial sustainability, exploit synergies between the two organisations and ensure the continuation of critical research and other scientific services.</p>

	Student Loans and Maintenance Grants
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-07-14b.47.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="47"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050714/text/50714-39.htm#50714-40_spmin2">
	<p pid="b.47.5/1">Following the outcome of our financial modelling, I am now able to confirm household income thresholds for the new maintenance grant, which is to be introduced to help low income students enter and continue in higher education from 2006&ndash;07. Those students with household income of &pound;17,500 or less will receive the full &pound;2,700 maintenance grant. Students with household income between &pound;17,501 up to &pound;37,425 will receive a partial grant. We therefore anticipate that around 30 per cent of new, full-time students will qualify for the full &pound;2,700 grant, with 50&ndash;55 per cent qualifying for a full or partial grant in 2006&ndash;07. Furthermore, the element of the new grant which is to be paid in substitution for the maintenance loan has now been set at &pound;1,200.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/2">I can also confirm that student loan rates in the 2006&ndash;07 academic year will be as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/3" class="italic">Full year rates</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/4">Students living at home: &pound;3,415</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/5">Students living away from home, in London: &pound;6,170</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/6">Students living away from home, outside London: &pound;4,405</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/7" class="italic">Final year rates</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/8">Students living at home: &pound;3,085</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/9">Students living away from home, in London: &pound;5,620</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/10">Students living away from home, outside London: &pound;4,080</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/11">This honours the commitment on loan rates made to the House by my right honourable friend, the Member for Norwich South, in his Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-08">8 January 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/12">These arrangements will be enacted in regulations which are expected to be laid before Parliament in January.</p>
