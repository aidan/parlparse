	EU Presidency: General Affairs and External Relations Council
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-30a.19.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="19"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51130-27.htm#51130-29_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.19.1/1">The General Affairs and External Relations council (GAERC) was held on 21 to <phrase class="date" code="">22 November</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw), the Defence Secretary (John Reid), and the International Development Secretary (Hilary Benn) chaired the council as presidency. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" name="Douglas Alexander">My right honourable friend the Minister for Europe (Douglas Alexander)</phrase> also represented the UK on certain agenda items.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/3">Defence Ministers</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/4" class="italic">Capabilities</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/5">The council approved the final Requirements Catalogue 05, which identifies the EU's military capability requirements and puts renewed emphasis on rapidly deployable, sustainable and interoperable armed forces. The catalogue was validated using computer-assisted operational analysis provided by NATO. Two further battlegroups were announced (Greece-Romania-Bulgaria-Cyprus and a Czech-Slovak group), which ensured the roster was filled to the end of 2008. Progress on capability development initiatives including battlegroups, the European Gendarmerie Force and the maritime dimension was welcomed. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/6" class="italic">Civil-military co-ordination</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/7">The work of the UK presidency in improving civil-military co-ordination, notably on comprehensive planning and security sector reform, was widely welcomed as a step towards bringing all the EU's instruments into a more effective holistic response. The Commission also supported this approach. Ministers agreed that this work should be applied to comprehensive reviews of the EU's engagement in Bosnia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and Aceh. The council also discussed the importance of EU support to building African peacekeeping capacity, and the EU's ability to respond rapidly to disasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/8" class="italic">European Defence Agency</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/9">The council welcomed the report by the head of the agency and agreed guidelines for the agency's work in 2006. Ministers exchanged views on the finalisation of administrative arrangements between the agency and Norway and Turkey. The presidency undertook to consult with those countries and return to the issue at the next opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/10" class="italic">Foreign and Defence Ministers: Bosnia</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/11">The council reviewed the EU military and police missions in Bosnia and agreed conclusions. It agreed that a continuing EU military presence was essential, with force levels broadly unchanged for the coming year. It established a follow-on police mission refocused to support police reform and the fight against organised crime, and agreed to strengthen the EU special representative's role in co-ordinating EU instruments. On the tenth anniversary of the initialling of the Dayton agreement, Ministers welcomed the progress made by Bosnia and authorised the Commission to open negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/12">Foreign Ministers</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/13" class="italic">Preparation for the 15-<phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase> European Council</p>

	<p pid="a.19.1/15" class="italic">Financial Perspectives 2007&ndash;2013</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/16">The presidency introduced this item and highlighted that it remained committed to reaching a deal in December. The presidency highlighted the need to make progress in three main areas: (i) the structure of EU spending; (ii) modernising the budget, including a timetable for review; and (iii) resources. Significant changes would be needed to the proposals made in June by the Luxembourg presidency. The presidency highlighted plans for a Ministerial conclave on <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>, ahead of which the presidency would table comprehensive proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/17" class="italic">WTO</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/18">The Commission set out the latest developments in the Doha round. On process, the Commission commented that they will continue to ensure transparency with member states and would consult the council fully at Hong Kong. Short conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/19" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/20">The presidency and High Representative Solana welcomed the agreement on the EU mission to monitor the Palestinian operation of the Rafah crossing point on the Gaza-Egypt border. The parties' acceptance of an international role was significant. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner highlighted that Commission capacity-building programmes would work hand-in-glove with the ESDP monitors. In preparation for the <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January</phrase> Palestine Legislative Council (PLC) elections, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said an election observation mission would deploy in mid-December and would consist of 172 observers. Monitors would strictly limit their contacts to issues related to the observation of the elections. The presidency underlined the importance of the EU maintaining its position that observers should not enter into dialogue with Hamas until they renounced violence and recognised Israel. Council conclusions were agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/21" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/22">The Foreign Secretary briefed on his recent visit to Iraq (10 to <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase>), highlighting that steady progress was being made. The Foreign Secretary emphasised the importance of the December elections, at which the Iraqis were keen for international observers. The council agreed that mounting a full EU election observation mission (EOM) would not be possible in the time available, but would explore what additional assistance it could provide in support of the <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase> elections. The council also agreed that the EU should be considering now how to prepare for closer relations with the new government next year. The presidency thanked the Commission for its work on the opening of a Commission Delegation in Baghdad. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said it was currently looking for a head of mission and, in addition, would shortly be submitting a draft negotiating mandate to member states for a trade and co-operation agreement with Iraq by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/23" class="italic">Iran</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/24">The presidency updated the council on the <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase> International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report. High Representative Solana highlighted the need to work closely with Mr El-Baradei and for the international community to stay firm and united. The presidency agreed that the issue remained difficult but it was important the European side actively supported a diplomatic solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/25" class="italic">Migration in External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/26">The council agreed council conclusions on migration in external relations and underlined their significance. The presidency noted the close interest taken by heads of government at Hampton Court on this issue. The Commission stressed the importance of better co-coordination of work between justice and home affairs, external relations and development and of increasing partnership with countries of origin and transit on migration issues. They particularly highlighted the need to improve engagement with sub-Saharan countries and to reinforce dialogue with neighbouring countries. The Commission also hoped that the reform of the financial instruments would enable it to respond more quickly and effectively to urgent migration-related situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/27" class="italic">EU Strategy for Africa</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/28">The council agreed conclusions on the Commission communication on the <i>EU-Africa Strategy: Towards a Euro-African Pact to Accelerate Africa's Development</i>. The communication will form an integral part of the overall EU strategy for Africa, which should be discussed and agreed by Foreign Ministers at the December GAERC and endorsed at the December European Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/29">During separate exchanges of views in preparation for the EU-Africa strategy, Foreign and Development Ministers identified the following priorities for the strategy: African ownership; mechanisms to monitor implementation of the strategy; increasing support for peace and security, including through a long-term commitment to the EU's African peace facility; good governance; trade and regional integration; establishing an EU-Africa infrastructure facility; meeting aid volume commitments and providing more assistance for health, education and the fight against AIDS; migration; environment; human rights; and economic partnership agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/30" class="italic">AOB&mdash;ASEM/Burma</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/31">The presidency highlighted the issue of Burmese participation at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) meetings and agreed that officials should take work forward and revert in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/32" class="italic">AOB&mdash;Cyprus</p>

	<p pid="a.19.1/35">At the request of Bulgaria, who highlighted that the Libyan court of appeal was allowing a new hearing on the case of the Bulgarian and Palestinian medical staff at the end of January.

This will be a joint declaration between the council, European Commission and European Parliament. It is divided into two parts: the first sets out common objectives and principles to guide the EU and its twenty-five member states in development, focused on poverty eradication and partner country ownership; and the second sets out the revised EC development policy which clarifies the Community's role and added value and ensures that priority attention be given to least developed and low income countries in resource allocation; and development shall be taken into account in other policies that affect developing countries. The European Parliament is expected to formally adopt the declaration in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/45" class="italic">Orientation Debate: Effectiveness of EU External Assistance</p>

	EU Presidency: Justice and Home Affairs Council
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-30a.28.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="28"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51130-30.htm#51130-30_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.28.1/1">The Justice and Home Affairs Council will be held on 1 to <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will be chairing the majority of the meeting and my noble and learned friend the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor will be chairing the items on civil justice. I will also be representing the presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/2">One of the key issues for this council will be counter-terrorism and the council will be asked to recognise the significant progress which has been made during the UK presidency. This will include approving the EU strategy on counter-terrorism, which is designed to complement the counter-terrorism action plan by providing a longer-term strategic direction. I am also hopeful that the council will be able to agree the draft strategy and action plan on radicalisation and recruitment, looking at the contributing factors involved and how they can be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/3">Following on from the discussions by heads of state at Hampton Court, there will be a strategic discussion at council of the Commission's contribution to the European Council paper on a global approach to migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/4">The Government have emphasised throughout the presidency the importance that we have attached to the external dimension of justice and home affairs issues. To reflect this, I hope to achieve agreement to the draft strategy on external relations at the council. Linked to this, and following on from the useful discussions at the informal JHA Council I hosted in Newcastle, I hope that the council will be able to agree draft council conclusions on increased EU assistance to combating drugs in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/5">Another key priority for the UK presidency has been to raise the profile of EU work to tackle human trafficking. This is expected to result in the agreement to a wide-ranging EU action plan at the council, which I very much welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/6">On the Framework Decision on Simplifying the Exchange of Information and Intelligence Between Law Enforcement Authorities, the European Council's call for political agreement was reinforced at the July council following the terrorist attacks on London. I hope that the council will be able to agree to a general approach on this measure, though this will pertain solely to the text of the draft instrument and not to its annexes, allowing further time for consideration and fine-tuning of the detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/7">Retention of telecommunications data is a complex dossier that has been subject to intense negotiation. Reaching a first reading deal with the European Parliament before the end of 2005 remains an ambitious but achievable goal. Subject to further progress in negotiations with the European Parliament and at ambassador level this week there remains a good chance that the council could reach political agreement on draft directive text. In that case I am hopeful that a First Reading agreement could be reached with the European Parliament during our presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/8">The European evidence warrant will provide a fast and effective way of obtaining evidence from another member state based on the principle of mutual recognition. There still remain issues to be resolved at the council, notably around the grounds for refusal contained in Article 15, but I hope to be able to deliver a compromise that all member states can accept so that we can reach a general approach on this important dossier.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/9">In the area of civil justice, three items of business will be discussed: the European order for payment, small claims and the directive on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters. This reflects the priority which we as a presidency have given civil justice. Our citizens live increasingly cross-border lives: they live, work, buy and sell across Europe's borders. EU co-operation in civil judicial matters can bring practical benefits to the lives of citizens across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/10">At the council, I hope that we can reach a general approach on the European order for payment. On the European small claims regulation, I hope to confirm the emerging consensus on the key principles of an effective European small claims procedure. Our aim is to achieve an accelerated and simplified procedure, as contemplated in the Tampere conclusions and re-stated in the Hague programme, based on the principle of proportionality. Lastly we intend to use the council to reach a broad agreement on the text of the draft directive on mediation, subject to outstanding questions of scope and subsidiarity and pending the opinion of the European Parliament. Progress in these areas will provide citizens and businesses with a means to resolve disputes more efficiently and at less cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/11">There will also be a state of play report on the Framework Decision on Certain Procedural Rights in Criminal Proceedings, which will set out the progress that has been made on this dossier and the areas of contention that still remain to be taken forward under the Austrian presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/12">In the margins of the council, the Mixed Committee will also meet with the Icelandic Minister in the chair. There will be a further brief discussion of the draft Framework Decision on Simplifying the Exchange of Information in this forum. There is also going to be a report on progress on the technical developments for the Schengen Information System II, to look at whether more needs to be done to help meet the 2007 timetable. Finally, I am expecting the Commission to make a presentation on its Communication on Enhanced Interaction Between the Visa Information System, Schengen Information System II and Eurodac.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/13">Finally, in the margins of the council, representatives of the member states, meeting inter-governmentally, will be looking to agree draft conclusions on common minimum security standards for ID cards. This will be important in addressing the weak link in EU travel documentation.</p>
