	<p pid="a.1.3/6">The council is expected to discuss the presidency's report on the state of discussions on EU institutional reform, including the issues raised during consultations with member states.

	<p pid="a.1.3/7"><I>Preparation of the European Council</I></p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/8">The council is expected to look ahead to the European Council on 21 and <phrase class="date" code="">22 June</phrase>, at which we expect treaty reform to be the main item.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.3/11">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/12"><I>Doha Development Round</I></p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/13">The Commission is expected to brief the council on preparations for the meeting of the G4 (EU, US, Brazil and India) on 19 to <phrase class="date" code="">23 June</phrase> in Potsdam. Discussion at the council is likely to focus on the importance of a balanced deal and the role of the G4 members and the Commission in the process.

	<p pid="a.1.3/14"><I>European Neighbourhood Policy</I></p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/15">The council is expected to adopt conclusions on the European neighbourhood policy acknowledging and building on the presidency progress report.

	<p pid="a.1.3/17">The presidency is expected to present its strategy for the development of EU relations with central Asia, which the Government support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/18"><I>Western Balkans</I></p>

The Government support Enlargement Commissioner Rehn's decision to restart negotiations with Serbia on its stabilisation and association agreement (SAA) on the basis that full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia will remain a requirement for SAA conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/20"><I>Middle East Peace Process</I></p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/21">The council is expected to discuss the forthcoming quartet meetings at the end of June with the parties and the Arab League; the continuing insecurity in Gaza; and the political situation in Israel following the Labour Party primaries on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-12">12 June</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.1.3/22">The council is expected to adopt conclusions on the situation in Nahr Al-Bared, which has seen a series of violent clashes between the Lebanese army and the Sunni extremist group Fatah Al-Islam.

	<p pid="a.1.3/23"><I>Arab League Initiative</I></p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/24">The presidency has proposed an EU troika meeting at senior official level with representatives from the Arab League.

	<p pid="a.1.3/30">The presidency is expected to brief partners on its proposal for the council to endorse a decision in principle for the EU to introduce an anti-death-penalty resolution at a forthcoming session of the UN General Assembly.

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Science and Innovation (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/2">The Government will today, <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">Monday 18 June 2007</phrase>, launch their review of UK strategic export controls, in the form of a full public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/3">The UK's strategic export controls support the Government's counter-proliferation objectives. They are based on the Export Control Act 2002, in particular its secondary legislation, which came into effect in 2004. This legislation overhauled the UK's export control system for the first time in more than 60 years and provided the comprehensive legislative framework needed to control proliferation activity and police the arms trade effectively in today's increasingly complex world. The changes were radical and far-reaching. That is why the Government made a public commitment to undertake a post-implementation review three years after implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/4">This review will enable the Government to revisit the UK's strategic export controls in the light of experience, to establish whether they are having the intended effect without imposing unnecessary or disproportionate burdens on business. The Government will also need to look to the future, so the consultation document sets out options for further change, many of which have been identified in discussions with both industry and non-governmental organisations. Ultimately the Government's aim is to find an effective and proportionate way to guard against the risk of undesirable exports and related activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/5">The consultation document considers a wide range of options for changes to the controls, including in relation to trading in military goods conducted by UK persons overseas; the provision of ancillary services such as transportation; the production of controlled goods overseas under licence from UK companies or by UK subsidiaries; the transfer of equipment for military use in embargoed destinations; and restrictions on the export of goods that could be used for torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.3/6">The consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="">30 September 2007</phrase>. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Library. At the end of this period, the Government will carefully analyse all responses received. They intend to publish the initial results of that analysis by <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Liam Byrne)</phrase> has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/2">I am today publishing a new strategy entitled <I>Managing Global Migration: A Strategy to Build Stronger International A</I><I>lliances</I><I> to Manage M</I><I>igration</I>. This strategy has been drawn up jointly between the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Copies of this document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/3">Around the world, Britain is laying the foundation of our offshore border controls. Our visa waiver test for all non-EEA countries is under way. Biometric visas are now issued in 75 countries. More than 20 million passenger movements have been screened before arrival in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/4">However, the impacts of migration are not issues that Britain faces alone. This strategy seeks to outline how we will work with European and international partners to better manage global migration. We will now make migration a key part of the UK's relations with other countries. Other priority actions are to enhance the sharing of data and expertise with other countries to make it easier for people to visit the UK for legitimate reasons and more difficult for those who seek to enter illegally or to do us harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/5">By working with EU partners we aim to further reduce &quot;asylum shopping&quot;. We will also make clear to illegal migrants' countries of origin the benefits of co-operating and the disadvantages of not doing so. By building bridges with priority countries we will bring needed skills to the UK to boost our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/6">The main proposals include:</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/7">developing arrangements with other countries to share immigration data and to jointly collect biometric data;exploring whether an international data exchange agreement would help us to achieve our aim of sharing appropriate immigration data easily and securely between all EEA countries and those with a visa waiver; setting up a team of immigration specialists that can be deployed abroad on a routine or emergency basis to offer advice, support and training where needed to help tackle illegal migration to the UK;reviewing our networks of overseas airline liaison officers and returns liaison officers, using law enforcement liaison officers along key illegal migration routes to the UK and considering the establishment of sea carrier liaison officers at sea ports;considering whether a new international organisation is needed to promote common international standards and technology in border control;making readmission of countries' own nationals an integral part of international relationships;further work with the EU to reduce asylum shopping, particularly through practical co-operation;building bridges with priority countries to bring needed skills to the UK; increasing the number and availability of visa application services to make it easier for legitimate travellers to come to the UK;exploring the potential for further links between diaspora communities in the UK and their home countries for the benefit of the UK economy; and working with EU member states and the European Commission to co-ordinate and unlock international efforts to better manage migration with third countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/8">I commend the strategy to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Kim Howells) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June 2007</phrase>, Her Majesty in Council made the Consular Fees (Amendment) Order 2007. The Government are today announcing new fees to be charged under this order with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">4 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/3">The order increases the level of the consular premium charged on passports issued in the UK by the Identity and Passport Service (IPS). This premium is the element in the cost of a passport which pays for the provision of consular assistance to British nationals overseas and which is collected in the UK by IPS on behalf of the FCO. The amount of the premium varies for different categories of passport. For the most commonly issued form of passport, the 32-page adult passport issued by post, the consular premium will rise from &pound;9.65 to &pound;15.12. The consular premium charged by the FCO on its passports, issued overseas, was increased in April 2007 by the Consular Fees Order 2007. A separate order was required to implement this change to passports issued in the UK by the IPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/4">This order also increases the minimum fee for making or verifying, including certifying where necessary, a copy of a document by photographic process, if the copy is made on the consular premises. It further introduces a fee for making searches in the naturalisation or registration records kept by a consular officer in posts where, prior to 1983, naturalisations and registrations were done by governors or high commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/5">It is right that those who benefit from consular assistance overseas, rather than the UK taxpayer in general, should help to meet the cost of this service. The new fees represent the full economic cost of what we do and will ensure that British missions overseas continue to provide a high standard of consular service to British nationals.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/6">A full list of the new fees, and the individual increases, is included in the attached table.</p>
