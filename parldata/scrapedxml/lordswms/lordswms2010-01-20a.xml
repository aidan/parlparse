	Equine Infectious Anaemia
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-01-20a.49.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="49"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100120-wms0001.htm#10012095000003">
	<p pid="a.49.1/1">My right honourable friend. the Secretary of State (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">I wish to inform to the House that on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-19">19 January 2010</phrase> the Chief Veterinary Officer for the United Kingdom confirmed equine infectious anaemia (EIA) in two horses in Wiltshire following importation from Romania via Belgium.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/3">Two premises are currently under restriction and the two infected horses will be humanely destroyed in line with existing regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/4">The animals arrived in a group of 10 horses, nine of which originated from Romania and one from Belgium. The nine Romanian horses were tested for EIA as part of routine post-import testing. Two of the horses tested positive, the remaining seven tested negative. The horse that originated in Belgium will be tested later today. As part of our control measures we will be undertaking a detailed epidemiological investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/5">The risk of further spread among horses is considered by experts to be very low, but this will be kept under review pending further epidemiological investigation. Expert advice from the Health Protection Agency is that EIA is not a risk to human health and that there is no evidence that this incident presents a risk to the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/6">This is the first case of equine infectious anaemia infected animals being imported into Great Britain since 1976 and shows the success of our post import testing regime. These were apparently healthy horses carrying a notifiable disease that we are keen to keep out of Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/2">My honourable friend the Minister for Marine and the Natural Environment (Huw Irranca-Davies) represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 14-<phrase class="date" code="2010-12-16">16 December</phrase>. Richard Lochhead MSP and Michelle Gildernew MLA also attended.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/3">On fisheries, Council agreed the annual fishing opportunities regulation for 2010 which sets fishing quota and effort limits, principally for the North Sea, Irish Sea, Channel, and Atlantic. Discussions were narrower than in previous years, as technical and control measures are no longer included in this measure, since they are now subject to co-decision with the European Parliament. However, the recent failure of talks between the EU and Norway on the annual fisheries agreement meant that the regulation would need to find an interim mechanism to allow fishing of the stocks concerned. This led to unexpected complexity and difficulty in the final negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/4">The major points of interest to the UK in the final compromise included:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/5">commitments to the implementation of incentive catch quota, the detail to be determined following an EU-Norway agreement;only a 9 per cent reduction in Irish Sea nephrops;a quota reduction of 25 per cent in West of Scotland Haddock (with 25 per cent in 2011);a quota reduction of 5 per cent for Western Channel Sole;a 10 per cent increase in quotas for North Sea and West of Scotland megrim;no reduction in Celtic Sea cod quota;a rollover of quota for North Sea nephrops; andagreement from the European Commission to look again at the technical measures re-imposed on the West of Scotland at the November Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/6">Following a ministerial lunch on animal health, discussions then turned to the substantive agriculture items. Firstly, the Council took note of the Commission's report on options for animal welfare labelling and animal welfare reference centres; which was followed by a brief state of play report from the Presidency on the negotiations to agree a revision to the current rules governing the welfare of laboratory animals (expressing confidence that a deal could be struck with the European Parliament early in 2010).</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/7">Continuing a trend of set-piece discussions on the future of the CAP, the Commission then presented its views on rural development policy post-2013 (it should be greener, and better aligned with the Lisbon Strategy), noting in summary that it saw no justification for continuing to finance Pillar 2 via modulation. Member States broadly welcomed the Commission's thoughts.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/8">Next, Council unanimously approved requests for state aid for agricultural restructuring from Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary. The UK, Denmark, Czech Republic, Estonia, Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Austria abstained.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/9">Council then reached partial political agreement on the timber due diligence regulation, though with further work needed on comitology provisions. The UK, Denmark, Spain and Belgium abstained, with the Netherlands voting against, because the final compromise did not include an express prohibition of the placing of illegally-logged timber on the Community market. The dossier would now be handed over to future Presidencies, starting with Spain, to handle negotiations with the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/10">Ministers took the opportunity to comment on the Commission's work on the 39 simplification proposals they had presented during the CZ Presidency. A number of the proposals had been addressed, but others had not been taken up. Denmark tabled a letter suggesting further discussions on the outstanding proposals at a political level. There was general support for two UK concerns: (1) that the Commission needed to be more joined-up and look at burdens on farmers beyond DG Agri and include DG Sanco and DG Environment; and (2) that the Commission should take a more risk-based approach to audits and controls, including the way penalties were applied. Work on this dossier would continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/11">The Commission then presented the latest instalment of its dairy market quarterly report noting that both commodity prices and farm gate prices had risen, that EU production remained lower than in 2008, and that the market was likely to be in balance in 2010. They also made reference to the recently established Dairy Fund, as well as to deliberations on improving the dairy supply chain in the High Level Group, as measures aimed at ameliorating the dairy crisis. The UK welcomed the positive trends and rising prices detailed in the report, urged the Council and Commission to focus on modernising the sector in preparation for the abolition of dairy quotas.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/12">The Commission presented its Communication on a better functioning food supply chain, a follow-up to last December's report on food prices to the European Council. Its aim was to examine the contractual relations across the chain, to monitor the development of competition issues, and to provide the basis for further in-depth discussions during the Spanish Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/13">Under any other business:</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/14">the Presidency presented its report of the Conference of the EU Paying Agencies;Poland called for abolition of the sugar production charge (the UK argued against with Commission support);Slovakia called for transitional aid in the sugar sector to be targeted at the affected producers;the Commission informed Council of its recent agreement with the US and Latin countries, resolving long-standing banana disputes;Council took note of the progress made to update on EU food labelling rules;the Commission gave an update on the ongoing difficult negotiations with Russia on sanitary and phytosanitary issues; andthe Netherlands informed Council of the outcome of a conference on GM policy held in the Netherlands from 25-<phrase class="date" code="2010-11-26">26 November</phrase>.</p>

	Families: Relationships
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-01-20a.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100797" speakername="Baroness Morgan of Drefelin" colon=":" colnum="51"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100120-wms0001.htm#10012095000021">
	<p pid="a.51.1/1">Strong, stable families are the bedrock of our society. Families give children the love and security they need to grow up and explore the world, and the moral guidance and aspiration to make the most of their talents and be good citizens. And families are where most of us find the support and care necessary for a happy and fulfilling life-as children and adults, parents and grandparents too.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/2"><I>Support for All: The Family and Relationships</I> Green Paper seeks to reflect the reality of families today. There have been significant changes in family form and structure; there has been a trend towards smaller families and a growth in the number of step families. Increasing numbers of couples are cohabiting and more children are being born outside of marriage. Roles within the family have also changed with more women going into paid employment and more fathers becoming involved in caring for children.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/3">This Government's conviction is that it is both possible and necessary to develop policies to support all families without intruding into the privacy of family life. This means supporting families to help themselves, ensuring that all public services play their part in supporting strong and resilient family relationships, but also recognising that sometimes relationships fail and that some families need extra help.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/4">Marriage is an important and well-established institution that plays a fundamental role in family life in our society. However, marriage is a personal and private decision for responsible adults, with which politicians should not interfere. The Government support couples who choose to get married: for many families marriage offers the best environment in which to raise children, and remains the choice of the majority of people in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/5">But families come in all shapes and sizes these days and the evidence is clear that stable and loving relationships between parents and with their children are vital for their progress and well-being. This was confirmed in the Families in Britain Evidence Paper. The Government are therefore strongly committed to supporting all parents, grand-parents and carers in sustaining strong and resilient relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/6">This Green Paper sets out a wide range of measures to support all families as they bring up their children and to help families cope with times of stress and difficulty. They recognise that while all families need some help, there are families in our society with complex needs and others who require additional-and sometimes non-negotiable-support. Some of the policy proposals can be implemented straight away; others are for consultation or will take longer to put into place.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/7">This policy is informed by <I>Families in Britain: an evidence paper</I>, published by my department and the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit in 2008, as well as by many other pieces of independent research, carried out both here and abroad during the past 10 years. It has also been influenced by discussions with experts and leading voluntary organisations; and by the views and experiences of families themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/8">All the proposals set out in this paper have been developed with a view to supporting stronger, more resilient families, who can help themselves and stronger, safer communities where families help each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/9">The consultation will remain open until <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-21">21 April 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/10">Copies of this paper are available in the Libraries of both Houses and available electronically at <a href="http://www.dcsf">www.dcsf</a>. gov.uk/supportforall.</p>

	Immigration and Nationality Fees
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-01-20a.53.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="53"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100120-wms0001.htm#10012095000035">
	<p pid="a.53.3/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration (Phil Woolas) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Alan Johnson) is today laying regulations for the fees for immigration and nationality services that are set at levels above the normal administrative costs of the service. The Government review the fees on a regular basis and makes appropriate changes as necessary. We have continued with our strategic approach to charging; setting certain fees above cost on the basis of the value of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/3">These fees must be set out in regulations before both Houses of Parliament and are subject to the affirmative procedure. The fees for these applications allow us to generate revenue which is used to fund the UK immigration system and to set certain fees below cost recovery to support wider government objectives. The revenue generated will contribute towards the development and delivery of the new points-based system, the rollout of ID cards for foreign nationals and investment in IT capability both overseas and in the UK. This coming year we will continue to strengthen that capability in underpinning technology and process improvement. For transparency, I have included the estimated unit cost for each route, so that it is clear the degree to which certain routes are set above cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/4">We have succeeded in limiting the extent of our general increases, by taking a more targeted approach to fees adjustment which is consistent with both the UK Border Agency's strategic charging principles, and also with broader government objectives. We have made several amendments to the UK settlement fees and we have proposed a nominal 10 per cent fee for all applications for UK-based dependants to reflect the fact that each individual brings a processing cost to us. Full details of all fees changes are outlined in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/5">Finally we will continue to generate revenue to fund the transitional impacts of migration. The Migration Impacts Fund has played a vital role in helping ease the pressures on certain communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/6">I am publishing today the fees for immigration and nationality services that are set at levels above the normal administrative costs of the service alongside these regulations. I will announce our proposals for the fees for immigration and nationality fees that are set below the administrative costs of the service when we lay negative regulations in February 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/7">Full details on how to apply for all of these services will be provided on our website at <a href="http://www.ukba">www.ukba</a>. homeoffice.gov.uk.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/8">A table of fees for 2010-11 for immigration and nationality services that are set at levels above the normal administrative costs of the service is set out below:</p>

	<p pid="a.58.1/1">My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Jack Straw) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/2">My right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) and I wish to make the following Statement to the House about the launch of a review of the family justice system in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/3">The family justice system involves life changing decisions for many thousands of children and their families each year at a cost to the taxpayer of over &#163;800 million. There have been some important elements of reform in recent years. But we need to be certain that the system, as it is currently set up, supports parents as fully as possible in establishing and maintaining a co-operative approach to agreeing future arrangements when relationships break down, and does not unwittingly cause additional stress at what will already be a difficult time. It is also important to ensure that valuable court time is focused on protecting the vulnerable from abuse, victimisation and exploitation and that the system is being managed as effectively as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/4">We have therefore decided to initiate a review of the family justice system and have secured the agreement of the Welsh Assembly Government that, where appropriate, the review shall encompass the devolved functions of Welsh Ministers. Gwenda Thomas, Deputy Minister for Social Services, has made a similar statement to the National Assembly for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/5">The review will be conducted by a panel, comprising four representatives independent of government and senior representatives from the Ministry of Justice, Department for Children, Schools and Families, and the Welsh Assembly Government as relevant for devolved matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/6">The review will be asked to make recommendations in two core areas: (1) what steps can be taken to promote informed settlement and agreement; and (2) whether improvements need to be made to the way in which the family justice system is managed.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/7">It will be guided by the following principles:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/8">the interests of the child should be paramount in any decision affecting them (and, linked to this, delays in determining the outcome of court applications should be kept to a minimum);the court's role should be focused on protecting the vulnerable from abuse, victimisation and exploitation and should avoid intervening in family life except where there is clear benefit to children and vulnerable adults in doing so;individuals should have the right information and support to enable them to take responsibility for the consequences of their relationship breakdown;mediation and similar support should be used as far as possible to support individuals themselves to reach agreement about arrangements, rather than having an arrangement imposed by the courts; the processes for resolving family disputes and agreeing future arrangements should be easy to understand, simple and efficient; andconflict between individuals should be minimised as far as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/9">Copies of the full terms of reference have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.1/10">We have asked for the review panel to provide a final report to us, as well as the Welsh Assembly Government Minister for Health and Social Services, in 2011.</p>
