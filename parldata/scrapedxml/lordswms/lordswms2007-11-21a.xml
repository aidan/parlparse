<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2007-11-21a.115.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100957" speakername="Lord Jones of Birmingham" colon=":" colnum="115"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71121-wms0001.htm#07112181000009">
	<p pid="a.115.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Competitiveness (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/2">I will be attending the EU Competitiveness Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/3">The main substantive item will be an integrated approach to competitiveness covering industry policy, e-skills, SMEs, succeeding in the age of globalisation, and European competitiveness. This will comprise the presentation of communications from the Commission and the adoption of council conclusions, and will be followed by an exchange of views on all five items. The UK will argue strongly in favour of a presumption towards openness when developing the EU's external policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/4">Further agenda items for which BERR is responsible are:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/5">better regulation (progress report followed by an exchange of views). This will be an opportunity for Ministers to debate the issue of how to improve legislation coming from Europe in advance of a review by the European Commission early next year, which will look at better understanding the economic impact of regulation, better consultation, and keeping red tape to a minimum;communication from the Commission on a simplified business environment for companies in the areas of company law, accounting and auditing (adoption of council conclusions). The UK will look to agree the text of conclusions, offering strong support for the Commission's simplification programme for company law;communication from the Commission on enhancing the patent system in Europe (progress report followed by an exchange of views). The Portuguese presidency has laid solid foundations for further work towards a European patent court and the UK welcomes its efforts, but, as its report recognises, further work needs to be done to ensure the creation of a high quality, efficient and affordable jurisdiction which delivers clear benefits to innovative businesses in Europe;proposal to amend the timeshare directive (progress report followed by an exchange of views). The UK is pleased with progress to date and hopes to see further progress in resolving the remaining issues; andcommunication from the Commission on agenda for sustainable and competitive European tourism (presentation by the Commission followed by adoption of council conclusions). The UK supports the Commission policy paper and conclusions, which recognises the importance of the development of tourism as a competitive economic activity, the need to balance this with environmental and social aims, and responds to the aims set out by the Lisbon agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/6">There will be nine further items taken under any other business:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/7">review of the single market (information from the Commission);free movement of goods (information from the presidency);classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (information from the presidency);events during the Portuguese presidency (information from the presidency);the internet of things (information from the presidency); product safety (information from the Commission);services of general interest (information from the Commission);trade defence instruments (information from the Commission); and legal protection of designs (information from the presidency).</p>
