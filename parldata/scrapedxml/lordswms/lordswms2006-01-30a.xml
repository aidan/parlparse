	<p pid="a.1.1/1">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> in Brussels. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw) and the Minister for Europe (Douglas Alexander) will represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/3" class="italic">General Affairs</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/4"><i>Annual Operational Programme of the Council for 2006/Annual Work Programme of the Commission</i>: Austrian Foreign Minister, Ursula Plassnik, will give a short presentation on the Annual Operational Programme of the Council 2006. The document forms the final part of the 2004&ndash;06 multi-annual strategic programme. There is clear continuity with the Luxembourg/UK programme for 2005 and the Government are supportive of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/5">President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso will also present the Commission's Legislative and Work Programme 2006 (CLWP), published in October 2005. The CLWP follows from the Commission's Strategic Objectives 2005&ndash;09 and focuses on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy&mdash;placing jobs, growth and better regulation at the centre of its programme. The Government support these aims.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/6"><i>Lisbon Strategy: Commission Annual Progress Report</i>: The Commission will formally present its first Lisbon Annual Progress Report, assessing member states' national reform programmes against &quot;jobs and growth&quot; objectives and highlighting priorities for further action. The Government will want to give clear support to the continued focus on jobs and growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/7" class="italic">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/8"><i>World Trade Organisation/Doha Development Agenda (WTO/DDA)</i>: EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson will brief the Council on progress in the WTO round. This follows an informal EU Trade Ministers dinner on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-29">29 January</phrase> and meetings of key WTO Ministers in the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos (25&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-01-29">29 January</phrase>). We expect a short discussion without Conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/9"><i>Relations with the Western Balkans</i>: Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn will present the Western Balkans Communication, which will form the basis of discussion at the Salzburg EU-Western Balkans Ministerial. The Council will also discuss Kosovo, in light of President Rugova's death on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-21">21 January</phrase>. The Council is expected to agree Conclusions on Bosnia, welcoming constitutional reform and Lord Ashdown's successor, and Montenegro, expressing support for Solana's personal representative, Ambassador Lajcak, as well as a statement on President Rugova's death. Conclusions are also expected to underline the continuing importance of full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) by both Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Government welcome the EU-Western Balkans ministerial as a chance to re-endorse the Thessaloniki messages of 2003 and focus on some hearts and minds initiatives to support the political process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/10"><i>Latin America: Presentation of Commission Communication</i>: Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner will present the Commission communication: <i>A stronger Partnership between the EU and Latin America</i>. The Council is expected to agree Conclusions on this at the February GAERC. The communication sets out a strategy for strengthening the relationship between the EU and Latin America, in terms that the Government broadly welcome.</p>

This provides an opportunity for Afghanistan to seek, and to receive, international support and endorsement for the next five years. The Afghanistan Compact represents an excellent framework for activity going forward. The Council is expected to agree Conclusions confirming the EU's long term support for the government and people of Afghanistan, welcoming the London Conference on Afghanistan and in particular the launch of the Afghanistan Compact. We also expect the Council to endorse <i>Recommendations for enhancing EU engagement with Afghanistan</i> and the presidency's statement to be given at the London Conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/12"><i>Belarus</i>: The Council will discuss the deterioration in human rights and democracy and the forthcoming presidential elections in Belarus. The Government remain concerned about the legitimacy of the 2004 referendum allowing the current president to stand for more than two terms and strongly supported November's GAERC Conclusions calling for free and fair elections. We welcome the invitation extended to OSCEIODIHR to monitor the election process and are keen that it should be able to function effectively throughout the election period. The Council is expected to agree Conclusions calling on Belarus to improve its record on human rights and democracy and expressing the EU's willingness to engage when the situation improves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/13"><i>Middle East Peace Process (MEPP)</i>: We expect Council discussion to focus on the outcome of the <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January</phrase> Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections, the changing political landscape in Israel in the run-up to the <phrase class="date" code="">28 March</phrase> elections and the implications for the MEPP. The Council is expected to agree Conclusions, which take into account the political situation in the Palestinian Authority and Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/14"><i>Iran</i>: The Council is expected to have a full discussion of handling of the forthcoming 2&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-02-03">3 February</phrase> emergency International Atomic Energy Agency Board meeting, following Iran's decision to restart enrichment related activities, and likely next steps on the nuclear issue. The Council is expected to agree Conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/15"><i>Iraq</i>: We expect that discussion will centre on the recent Iraqi election results and future EU-Iraq engagement. The Government will wish to stress the importance of EU JUSTLEX, support for the Constitutional Review, maintaining a political dialogue under the EU-Iraq Joint Political Declaration and progress towards the launch of negotiations on a Trade and Co-operation Agreement. The Council is expected to agree Conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.1/16"><i>Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)</i>: The presidency will seek agreement on the participation of senior representatives of Burma/Myanmar at upcoming ASEM meetings held in the EU. The Government support the ASEM process as a means of engaging with Asian states on a range of issues that matter to us.

	EU: Employment and Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2006-01-30a.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="4"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60130-55.htm#60130-55_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.4.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/2">The Employment and Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Informal Council was held on 19&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-01-21">21 January</phrase> in Villach, Austria.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">My honourable friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs (Gerry Sutcliffe)</phrase> and I attended the working session for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/4">The Austrian presidency posed two topics for discussion on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">Friday 20 January</phrase>. The morning session discussed &quot;Flexicurity&mdash;flexibility through Security&quot;. The afternoon session discussed &quot;The Social dimension of the revised Lisbon strategy and the streamlining of social policy processes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/5">My honourable friend represented the UK during the morning discussion of &quot;Flexicurity&quot;. This session explored new ways of balancing flexibility and social and employment security in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/6">Member States took examples from their national reform programmes to illustrate the balance they had struck between flexibility and security. For the UK, my honourable friend suggested that legislative measures were for the national level and the EU could add value by sharing experience and good practice and by promoting better regulation principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/7">The Commissioner noted that &quot;flexicurity&quot; would be addressed in the Commission green paper on labour law, due in the first half of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/8">Overall, Ministers agreed that there is no one size fits all model for flexicurity, but disagreed whether legislative action should be taken at the EU level.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/9">The afternoon session asked Ministers to focus on the presidency question about the social dimension of the strategy for growth and jobs and the desired role and outputs for streamlined open method of co-ordination of social policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/10">For the UK, I called for practical discussion about real policies rather than theoretical debate of principles. I suggested that the aim should be to integrate social policy making within an overall reform strategy where it could contribute to the delivery of employment aims.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/11">There was a consensus that a visible social dimension to the Lisbon strategy must be maintained and that streamlining open method of co-ordination would help.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.1/12">The presidency then proposed that Employment Ministers should feed these messages into the spring European Council.</p>
