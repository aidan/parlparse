	<p pid="a.15.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Pensions (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/2">We are aware that trustees of schemes whose sponsoring employers are currently in financial difficulty are uncertain as to whether they would be able to be considered for PPF compensation once the PPF is launched next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/3">The Government are now able to state that eligible schemes whose sponsoring employer has already entered insolvency proceedings may still be able to receive PPF compensation. The scheme will still have to satisfy other PPF eligibility criteria&mdash;in particular, the sponsoring employer will need to have an insolvency event after the introduction of the PPF and the pension scheme must not have commenced wind-up prior to that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/4">The Pensions Bill provides a power that could be used to exclude schemes that have an insolvency event before the PPF is launched. We wish to make clear that we have no plans to use this power.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.3/2">Details of UK Trade &amp; Investment's &pound;16 million programme of support for UK company participation in supported groups at overseas exhibitions, seminars and sector-focused outward missions will be placed in the Library of the House. Accredited trade organisations that bid for support to arrange groups are being informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.3/3">These overseas exhibitions, seminars and sector-focused outward missions continue to be an important component of trade development work worldwide. UK Trade &amp; Investment recognises that accredited trade organisations need the flexibility to react to changing international events and opportunities. The operation of the programme during the 2005&ndash;06 financial year will continue to provide this flexibility, within the constraints imposed by the overall budget provision, and the need for prudent budget management and efficient administration.</p>
