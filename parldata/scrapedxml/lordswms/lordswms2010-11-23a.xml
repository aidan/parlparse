	<p pid="a.66.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office (Francis Maude) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/2">I invited Martha Lane Fox, the Government's Digital Champion, to undertake a strategic review of Directgov which was completed on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October 2010</phrase>. This supported the work that the Efficiency and Reform Board had undertaken on Channel Shift and the opportunity for digital channels to support delivery of the Spending Review. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury and I wrote to departments in September outlining our commitment to improving services and driving efficiencies by making digital the default channel for government information and transactional services.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/3">Martha Lane Fox submitted her report <I>Directgov 2010 and beyond: revolution not evolution</I>, to me in October. The report places Directgov in the context of how Government should use the internet both to communicate and interact better with citizens and to deliver significant efficiency savings from making digital the default delivery channel for government information and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/4">I have written to Martha Lane Fox today thanking her for her report and saying that I am minded to accept her proposals in full, but that I will need to consult with colleagues before making any final decisions about how to take them forward. I have placed Martha Lane Fox's report and my response in the Library. Both documents are also available on the Cabinet Office website (<a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk">www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/5">I expect quick and broad agreement on some of Martha Lane Fox's proposals where we can make rapid progress and that in some areas, such as moving to a single domain for government, I will have to work with departments to test different approaches and work through the details and timescales. It is important to set a clear direction of travel and that is what I have done in my reply as the initial government response to Martha Lane Fox's proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.1/1">My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Kenneth Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">Following the recall to custody and subsequent conviction of Jon Venables for the possession of indecent images of children, I commissioned Sir David Omand GCB to undertake an independent review of the post-release period of the case, covering Jon Venables' supervision from release on life licence in June 2001 until <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-24">24 February 2010</phrase>, when he was recalled to custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/3">The review has encompassed the general principles of a serious further offence (SFO) review but has also considered the wider lessons to be learnt for the future management of this and similar cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/4">The terms of reference of the review were:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/5">to review the supervision of the subject, from his release on life licence until his recall to custody, in order to establish whether he was effectively supervised, having regard to national standards and guidance and to the particular circumstances/challenges of his case;in doing so, to consider the actions of his offender managers, their supervisors, the local police, the local MAPPA meetings and the role of the National Management Board; andto establish whether everything was done which might reasonably have been expected of all agencies involved in supervising the subject to monitor his compliance with his licence conditions and to assess and manage any risk of harm which he presented.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/6">Sir David Omand has completed the review and submitted his report to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/7">I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of his report, which has been redacted in a few places to comply with the terms of the injunction amended in the High Court on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-23">23 July 2010</phrase> (commonly known as the Butler-Sloss injunction), to take account of data protection and other confidentiality laws and to protect very sensitive operational policing information.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/8">Sir David has concluded that Jon Venables was effectively and properly supervised at an appropriate level and frequency of contact, having regard to the particular circumstances of his case. Sir David also concludes that no reasonable supervisory regime would have been expected to detect his use of the computer to download indecent images.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/9">I have accepted the review's recommendations, which will be taken forward by officials in the National Offender Management Service. Officials will provide me with an update on the implementation of the recommendations in due course.</p>

	Disabled People: Work Capability Assessments

	<p pid="a.84.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Employment (Chris Grayling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/2">The Government are pleased to announce the publication of Professor Malcolm Harrington's Independent Review of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). This is a substantial and thorough review of the WCA which the Government fully endorses. Alongside the review, the Government are publishing their response which sets out how we will implement the review's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/3">A central part of the Government's plans to reform the welfare state involves action to tackle incapacity benefit dependency. More than 2.2 million people in Britain today are on incapacity benefits and many have been abandoned, with little or no contact from the welfare state for as long as a decade or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/4">Through the WCA we seek to change this, and to try to find a better way forward for those people. From April 2011 we will put 1.6 million people, all of those on incapacity benefits who are not close to retirement, through an independent medical assessment, the WCA. Those found fit for work or with the potential to return to work will be given support to help them do so; those who are deemed unable to work will continue to receive full support.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/5">We believe that the principles of the WCA are right but we are clear that the process of assessment must be fair and honest about people's potential. We do not wish to see people who are genuinely unable to work put in a position where they are expected to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/6">Professor Harrington's review sets out how we can refine the system and significantly improve the process so that it continues to be fit for purpose. We intend to implement these changes as quickly as possible. Many will be put in place in time for the first assessments from the national migration in April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/7">We will continue to review the WCA and to make further changes where necessary. We have invited Professor Harrington to continue in his current role as independent reviewer for another year and to make further recommendations to us as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/8">Copies of both documents are available in the Vote Office.</p>
