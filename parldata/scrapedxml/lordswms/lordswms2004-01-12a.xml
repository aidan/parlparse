	Investors Scheme
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-01-12a.15.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="15"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040112/text/40112-14.htm#40112-14_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.15.1/1">The investor category of the immigration rules was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="1994-10-01">1 October 1994</phrase> for investors who wish to come to the UK to invest &pound;1 million. This must include a &pound;750,000 investment in UK government bonds, or in share or loan capital in active and trading UK registered companies as set out within the immigration rules. At present the UK attracts around 26 investors to the UK a year, providing around &pound;26 million of investment in the UK a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/2">As part of the Government's approach to sensible, managed migration where it is in the UK's economic interest, we are revising this category in the light of the experience of other countries who have similar investment routes. The Government recognise that it is important to have effective opportunities for major investors and that the category could be improved to attract more high net worth migrants to come to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/3">We have decided to allow overseas investors in future to use loaned money from an authorised financial institution (those regulated by the Financial Services Authority) where the potential investor has a personal net worth of &pound;2 million. In Canada, similar changes were made to their investors category resulting in an increase in investors moving to Canada. The UK hopes to emulate this success.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/4">Investors whose funds are tied up in illiquid assets and investors who prefer to invest their own money in higher interest investment products will now be able to apply to enter the UK as a result of these changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/5">The revised arrangements for the investors route will be reflected in the Immigration Rules on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-13">13 January 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence (Mr Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.3/2">Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) achieved full operating capability by <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">31 December 2003</phrase> as planned. Fourteen CCRFs are now available to support the civil authorities if they ask for military assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.3/3">The emergency services would lead on the response to any incident and can call on a range of support, which includes the specially trained CCRFs as required. A programme of exercises between local CCRFs and emergency services began in 2003 to test how they would work together in an emergency. CCRFs will provide general duties support consistent with the established military aid framework, and the normal Ministry of Defence command structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.3/4">It is important to remember that CCRFs are just one of the ways in which the Armed Forces can provide support, and that support itself would be part of a much wider response.</p>

	&quot;Their Past Your Future&quot; Collaborative Education Programme
</major-heading>

	<p pid="a.16.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.1/2">We are pleased to announce the launch today of a new collaborative education programme called &quot;Their Past Your Future&quot; across the United Kingdom. We are grateful to my right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Education and Skills and for Culture, Media and Sport for their enthusiastic support for this project, all the funding for which is being provided by the National Lottery New Opportunities Fund. The programme will give young people at school the opportunity to research and understand the role played by Service veterans and civilian groups in ensuring our national security and survival. It will focus on the important Second World War commemorative events taking place in 2004&ndash;05, but is intended to develop into a long-term project recognising the importance of peace and reconciliation as well as conflict. A website will provide information about the programme and ways of linking up veterans and eye-witnesses with schools so that children can draw on those memories and experiences for their own understanding. There will be resources for schools to use in the citizenship and history curricula. This will also stretch out into other subject areas such as English and geography. Opportunities for young people to participate in commemorations at home and abroad are also central to this programme. As part of this last element, there will be an initial research-based competition available with a prize of participation in the D-Day commemorations in June 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.1/3">The programme is a good example of collaboration on veterans-related issues across the official and voluntary sectors. It was developed as part of the Veterans Initiative, but the Imperial War Museum will lead this project. Key partners include the Department for Education and Skills, the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations, the Royal British Legion, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and Service Museums as well as the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.1/4">As we said before, we are particularly pleased that the National Lottery New Opportunities Fund has undertaken to provide funding and that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is also closely involved in the collaborative effort that is necessary for a project of this nature. This is an excellent example of lottery money being used for a good cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.1/5">We hope that projects of this kind will help future generations to remember and understand the experiences and sacrifices of veterans of all types and their role in our nation's history. We also urge right honourable and honourable Members to make schools and colleges in their constituencies aware of this project.</p>
