	<p pid="b.43.1/1">Today the Government are announcing the publication of the Race for Justice taskforce report. The taskforce was set up by me in response to one of the specific recommendations made in a report of the Gus John Partnership in 2003, entitled <i>Race for Justice</i>. That report recommended establishing a holistic approach across the criminal justice system to the handling of racist and religious crimes. The Race for Justice taskforce report sets out a range of recommendations which aim to improve the handling, investigation and prosecution of racist and religious crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/2">The Office for Criminal Justice Reform has produced a cross-agency action plan and will establish a delivery board to take forward the recommendations of the Race for Justice taskforce report. We believe that, through a more joined-up approach to handling these crimes, we can increase the trust and confidence of people from black and minority ethnic communities in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.1/3">Both the Race for Justice taskforce report and the original report by Professor Gus John have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.5/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/2">As indicated in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's five-year plan, which was deposited in the House Libraries on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-17">17 March 2005</phrase>, we undertook a public consultation between <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-25">25 November 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase> about lottery funding for the good causes of arts and film, heritage and sport after 2009. I am now announcing the outcome and my decision on future arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/3">The public told us that there is overwhelming support for what lottery money is used for in the arts and film, heritage and sport and that there is very strong support for the existing share balance; people believe very strongly that each cause is important and they want stability and continuity. So I am delighted to announce my decision, which is that I will retain the current lottery shares for arts, sport and heritage for 10 years from 2009 to 2019.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/4">The Olympic funding package will remain: &pound;750 million from new lottery games and &pound;410 million from existing causes after 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/5">We have concluded that there is no case for changing the current, population-based, arrangement for lottery funding for arts and sport between the home countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/6">The UK Film Council will in future take on all film funding from Arts Council England and I will present a statutory instrument to Parliament to make a small adjustment to the percentage shares to reflect the present level of expenditure on capital grants for film of &pound;3 million a year.</p>
