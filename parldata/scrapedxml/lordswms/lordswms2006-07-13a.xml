	<p pid="a.53.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State (Ian McCartney) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2">The All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Great Lakes Region and Genocide Prevention (APPG) reported in February 2005 on the effectiveness of the application of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (guidelines) to the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">It made a number of recommendations, and in response the Government committed to consult on possible improvements to the UK National Contact Point's (NCP) promotion and implementation of the guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/4">The Government received 10 written responses to the consultation document by the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-06">6 January 2006</phrase>. In addition, a joint working group (JWG), established under the aegis of the APPG to explore the scope for common ground between businesses and non-governmental organisations on frameworks for business conduct in areas of conflict and weak governance, requested and was granted further time to submit a response. It did so on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-23">23 June 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/5">The Government are grateful to all interested parties who took the time and effort to meet the NCP and/or submit written responses to the consultation document. They are particularly grateful to the members of the JWG for their willingness to discuss and make recommendations that commanded broad support from both the businesses and the NGOs involved. The Government believe that the similarities between their own, evolving considerations since the publication of the consultation document and the views expressed by businesses and NGOs reflects an emerging consensus over practical and effective steps that can be taken to improve the promotion and implementation of the guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/6">I have today published the Government's response to the consultation. A copy will be made available in the Libraries of both Houses and will be accessibleon the DTI website. Among a number of commitments, the Government will:</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/7">launch a refocused NCP by September 2006 to include officials from the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as well as the Department of Trade and Industry;establish a steering board to oversee the operation of the NCP. It will include representatives of all government departments with an interest in the guidelines as well as independent members selected for their expertise in relevant issues; andtighten criteria and timescales and improve transparency when the NCP considers allegations that the guidelines have not been followed.The Government will review the effectiveness of the changes, in consultation with stakeholders, in a year's time.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/8">The Government want the new NCP to work with businesses, employees and other parties to deal with issues raised under the guidelines. I believe that this approach, allied with the changes set out in the Government's response, will deliver a more openand transparent system in which all organisations can put their faith in encouraging responsible business activities overseas.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/2">The Government's Office for Disability Issues (ODI) has today published its first annual report to the Prime Minister, which details the progress that is being made towards realising the Government's ambitious vision for real equality for disabled people by 2025. Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/3">The ODI was launched in December 2005 to deliver the strategy set out in the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report, <I>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People</I>. Since then, the ODI has successfully formed partnerships with internal and external stakeholders and driven forward an ambitious programme of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/4">This first report highlights a broad range of initiatives that are starting to address the barriers disabled people experience in accessing services, including housing, transport, justice and leisure. For example, through the individual budgets pilots, we are testing out new ways of giving people more choice and control over the way they are supported. Three pilot sites in Oldham, Essex and west Sussex are already testing this new way of working, with the remaining 10 sites to come on stream this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/5">The report provides an update on action against all the recommendations in the <I>Life Chances</I> report and makes clear what further activity is necessary to deliver improved outcomes for disabled people. One key area where Government need to do much more is in involving disabled people in the design and delivery of services which impact on their lives. The ODI's report provides information on our progress in developing a UK advisory network on disability equality, which will be established from later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/6">I commend this report to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-07-13a.55.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="55"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60713-wms0154.htm#06071359000041">
	<p pid="a.55.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/2">As my Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase> said, the Government set up the Review Group on Common Parts, during the passage of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, to review the legal position in relation to alterations to the common parts of let residential premises and of residential commonholds and to make recommendations. The Government are very grateful for Members' work on this and have published the group's report on my department's website at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/aboutus/business.asp">www.dwp.gov.uk/aboutus/business.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/3">This is an initial response to the report and covers the five non-legislative recommendations made by the review group. We are continuing to consider the complexities of the legislative recommendations, including with the devolved administrations, and will issue a further response as that work develops.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/4">The review group considered disabled facilities grants (DFG) to be an important source of assistance for disabled people who need alterations made to their home. We agree and have recently increased resources in England so that we could end the means testing of families where alterations are for children. DFG funding is already available for alterations to the common parts of residential premises, and this will continue. DFG resources have been increased significantly by this Government (in England from &pound;56 million in 1997-98 to &pound;121 million in 2006-07). The review group called for more money to be made available for DFGs and we will consider this further as an integral part of the cross-government spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/5">In addition, a government review of DFGs is currently underway following independent research and recommendations made by Bristol University. This review is looking to make the DFG process easier and quicker to use in respect of all alterations, including those to the common parts of let residential premises. As recommended by the review group, we are also considering, in the context of the review of DFGs, the merits of an increased role for regional housing boards in the provision of accessible housing and housing adaptations.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/6">The review group recommended that guidance should be made available on making alterations to the common parts of let residential premises and of residential commonholds. This would inform landlords, commonhold associations and disabled people about the current law and other relevant issues, and help them resolve potential disputes. The inclusion of appropriate guidance in housing organisations' publications about housing-related issues would be an effective way of disseminating good practice and, in particular, such guidance could encourage the use of alternative dispute resolution procedures rather than automatic resort to the courts where disputes arise. We will prepare such guidance in consultation with the devolved administrations and will discuss it with appropriate organisations. And, as the review group recommended, in considering responses to our consultation on proposals for a code for sustainable homes for England, we will consider the extent to which it would be appropriate to incorporate guidance on improving the accessibility of common parts of premises in new builds.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-07-13a.58.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="58"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60713-wms0155.htm#06071359000064">
	<p pid="a.58.3/1">Today we are publishing two publications which will take forward our commitment to place patients and the public at the heart of the way our health services are run: <I>Health reform in England update and commissioning framework</I>; and <I>A Stronger Local Voice</I>, which sets out the Government's plans for the future arrangements to support public involvement in health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/2">The update on health reform sets out a clear vision: to develop a patient-led NHS that uses available resources as effectively and fairly as possible to promote health, reduce health inequalities and deliver the best and safest possible healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/3">The centrepiece of today's update publication is a framework for commissioning. It will act as a manual for new primary care trusts to achieve excellence in the way they secure healthcare for their local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/4">Commissioning is the means by which we secure the best possible healthcare and outcomes, including reduced health inequalities, within the money made available by the taxpayer. Commissioning itself is not new, but stronger primary care trusts and the acceleration of practice-based commissioning&mdash;together with the powerful new set of incentives and mechanisms introduced by the health reforms&mdash;provide the opportunity for far more effective commissioning that will benefit patients and taxpayers alike.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/5">Effective commissioning will require:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/6">Real community engagement and a stronger voice for patients achieved through increased choice, widespread involvement and greater opportunity to influence changes to services:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/7">clinical engagement through practice-based commissioning; improved information to support commissioning; andcommissioning levers through choice, payment by results and robust contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/8">The reorganisation of PCTs, the moves towards universal coverage of practice-based commissioning, and the establishment of the specialist commissioning groups will provide the basic architecture for commissioning NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/9">The Department of Health will be seeking views from the NHS and partner organisations over the summer on the key proposals to inform final decisions. Views are sought on options for contracting in the NHS, a governance and accountability framework for practice-based commissioning and triggers for petitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/10">The framework sets out the development programmes we are making available to all PCTs as they build on the good commissioning practice that already exists. We are also issuing an OJEU notice today to procure a framework agreement and call-off contract which will enable PCTs to draw on private sector expertise to support their commissioning. This does not in any way affect or relate to PCT directly provided services. PCT boards will be entirely free to choose to what extent, if any, they make use of the call-off contract. In all cases the PCT board remains accountable and responsible for all commissioning decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/11">This commissioning framework focuses on commissioning NHS services, and in particular commissioning hospital services. This is the first step in making commissioning truly effective. We know that joint commissioning of services with local authorities and commissioning for health and well-being are important too. A second framework covering these wider issues will be published in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/12">The commissioning framework is supported by an update on the other elements of the reform programme: choice, provider reform, workforce, system management, tariff and other financial incentives and information.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/13">Effective commissioning will require real community engagement. The commissioning framework will therefore work alongside <I>A Stronger Local Voice</I>, which sets out the Government's plans for the future arrangements to support public involvement in health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/14">These include plans to build on patient and public involvement forums through the creation of local involvement networks (LINks). The networks will provide a flexible vehicle for communities and groups to engage with health and social care organisations, and will promote public accountability in health and social care through open and transparent communication with commissioners and providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/15">We also plan to simplify and strengthen the legislative requirements currently set out in Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, to clarify the duties on all NHS bodies to involve and consult patients and the public on all services they provide or commission. There will be a new duty placed on commissioners to respond to what patients and the public have said.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/16">We believe that the new environment being created by the reforms, using incentives and commissioning, will mean that commissioners become advocates for patients and taxpayers, driving up the quality, fairness, responsiveness and value for money of NHS services.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.3/17">Copies of all today's publications have been placed in the Library.</p>
