	<p pid="b.92.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/2">This Statement concerns a consultation on the transfer of certain powers from existing planning authorities to the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). The ODA is to be established, subject to parliamentary approval, following Royal Assent to the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/3">The making of the planning functions order to give the ODA powers must be preceded by a consultation process. Copies of the Olympic Delivery Authority (Planning Functions) Order Consultation Paper have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses today. The consultation period will run from today for eight weeks until <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/4">Giving planning powers to the ODA will facilitate the planning process for the Olympic Park, bearing in mind the scale of development involved, the timescales attached, and the integrated nature of the project. The transfer of powers from the existing planning authorities to the ODA would not change the nature of those powers, nor would it lessen the transparency of the planning process. The ODA as planning authority would follow the same, or similar, procedures as the boroughs and the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation, in which the Olympic Park is situated. Applicants would have the same rights of appeal against decisions by the ODA.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/5">The planning powers taken by the ODA will operate within a defined geographical boundary. The consultation map shows the expected area of the Olympic Park, as well as other areas where development is considered integral to the delivery of the park. The consultation paper does not seek views on the layout of the park or the area to be covered by the Olympic Park development. The consultation paper seeks views on what area should be subject to ODA planning powers and the extent of the planning powers to be given to the ODA.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-02-15b.92.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="92"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60215-42.htm#60215-42_spmin2">
	<p pid="b.92.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (John Hutton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.3/2">I am pleased to announce that there will be no increase in either the Pensions Regulator general levy rates or the Pension Protection Fund administration levy rates for 2006&ndash;07. Rates will remain at the 2005&ndash;06 level as set out in the tables below.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.3/3">The general levy meets the cost of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) whose objective is to protect the benefits of members of occupational and private pension schemes; to reduce risks that lead to calls on the Pension Protection Fund and to promote and improve understanding of the good administration of work based pension schemes. It also meets the cost of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Pensions Advisory Service which provide scheme members with help, advice and information.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.3/4">The Pension Protection Administration Levy meets the cost of administrating the Pension Protection Fund. This cost is initially met by money provided by Parliament, then recouped through this levy. The Pension Protection Fund provides compensation to members of non-money purchase pension schemes where the employer in respect of the scheme becomes insolvent later than <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> and where the scheme is under-funded and is unable to purchase benefits for members above the level that the Pension Protection Fund would provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.3/5">The provisions for the general levy are in existing secondary legislation (S.I. 2005/626). The proposed provisions for the PPF Administration Levy are in draft regulations which will be debated in both Houses of Parliament.</p>
