	Asian Tsunami
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-12-13a.111.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="111"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51213-39.htm#51213-39_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.111.1/1">I should like to make a Written Statement on the commemorative events planned for the anniversary of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean. This follows previous Statements to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/2">I wish to express again my deepest sympathies and condolences and those of the entire Government to the family and friends of all the British nationals who lost their lives in the tsunami and to all the British nationals who suffered trauma or injury. This feeling, I am sure, is shared by every Member of the House. And we remember too the millions of people from the region who lost loved ones or whose lives have been shattered by the tsunami. The anniversary on <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase> will be a very painful time for all those affected by the disaster; our thoughts and prayers will be with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/3" class="italic">British victims of the tsunami</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/4">We have now confirmed that a total of 149 British nationals died as a result of the tsunami: 129 in Thailand, 17 in Sri Lanka and three in the Maldives. The bodies of 143 of these people have been identified. The bodies of the remaining six have not yet been identified. There is one British national whose death has not been confirmed and who is still listed as a category one missing person&mdash;that is, highly likely to have been caught up in the tsunami.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/5" class="italic">Anniversary arrangements</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/6">On the morning of <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase>, the Royal Thai Government are arranging events in six separate locations where the greatest loss of life occurred. One memorial event will be held on Phi Phi Island; two in the Khao Lak area; and three in the Phuket area. A memorial foundation-stone laying ceremony will take place in Khao Lak on the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase>, followed in the evening by an inter-faith service. Both of these events will be attended by the Prime Minister of Thailand. I will represent the Government at the anniversary events.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/7">We expect that around 130 British nationals will travel to Thailand for the anniversary. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's priority will be to provide support for families of the British victims during this very difficult time. As part of the special package of assistance which I agreed for victims of the tsunami, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will cover the travel and accommodation costs of a number of British nationals travelling to Thailand to mark this anniversary. Some of those families who have already taken advantage of this package of assistance and some of those injured will have their travel and accommodation provided for by the Royal Thai Government. A few families have chosen to travel independently, and will make their own arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/8">The families of all British victims will be met at Bangkok airport and at Phuket airport and given assistance with travel to official commemorative events on <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase>. If they wish, officials from the Government and the British Red Cross will accompany them during their visit. The British Ambassador, David Fall, and I will attend a religious service and host a reception in Phuket on <phrase class="date" code="">24 December</phrase> for the families and for survivors.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/9">In Sri Lanka, many communities and religious groups along the coast will hold events to mark the anniversary of the tsunami. The Sri Lankan authorities are not planning to hold a large-scale commemoration ceremony but they are organising an inter-faith service on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase> in the town of Bentota, on the south-west coast. We expect that 15 British nationals will travel out to Sri Lanka for the anniversary. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will cover the accommodation and travel costs of some of those going out through the special package of assistance. Others are travelling independently. The Sri Lankan Government will also mark the anniversary with a remembrance service held on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="">26 December</phrase> at their High Commission in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/10">The Maldives Government are not planning to commemorate the anniversary as the whole of this year has been declared a year of national unity to mark the tsunami. We are not expecting any British nationals to travel there for the anniversary itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/11">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa Jowell) has recently visited India, Thailand and Sri Lanka to thank all the staff and volunteers for their work in the aftermath of the tsunami. In Thailand she discussed arrangements for the forthcoming anniversary commemoration with the Thai Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/12">The Government deeply appreciate the tremendous support and kindness shown by the governments and the peoples of all the countries in which British people were killed. At a time when they were each overwhelmed by their own national tragedies, they have shown enormous compassion and generosity to the nationals of other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/13" class="italic">Ongoing government response</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/14">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to provide support and assistance to British nationals affected by the tsunami. The United Kingdom has a dedicated consular team in Phuket for this purpose. We have also encouraged the British Red Cross to use some of the money which was donated by the public for tsunami relief to assist British families who are suffering financial hardship. The fund will primarily be available to UK residents, and grants will be made available to individuals who have been seriously affected by the tsunami, whether through bereavement, injury or trauma. Funds are also available for those otherwise unable to afford travel to events such as the formal inquest in West London. Payments from the fund will normally be single grants of up to &pound;10,000 per individual in respect of financial hardship and up to &pound;2,000 for those requiring private psychological treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/15">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has taken over the running of the Red Cross helpline which had been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This helpline offers support and telephone counselling to all victims of the tsunami and provides advice on, for example, how victims can get long-term psychological help or on how to access the benefits system. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is also funding the Red Cross tsunami support network which was set up by the Red Cross and was also initially funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/16">Police family liaison officers got back in touch with all the families of the victims in the run-up to the formal inquest into the majority of the British deaths last week. Three British police officers are still seconded to the international disaster victim identification team in Thailand and are expected to remain there until the end of February.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/17">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is continuing to improve its crisis management procedures in the light of the recently published joint report by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the National Audit Office on lessons learned from our response to the tsunami. The report concludes that Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff in the region and in London &quot;coped tremendously well under severe pressure&quot; and that they had &quot;worked extremely long hours and made great personal sacrifices&quot;. But the unprecedented scale of the tsunami meant that some people did not get the level of support which we would have wanted to give them. Where that happened, I have apologised to the families affected and we have listened to their suggestions for how we could have done better.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/18">The joint report includes detailed recommendations on how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office can further improve its emergency response. We have accepted those recommendations in full; we have already implemented some and others are in hand. So, for example, although we had put in place new arrangements with the police for handling calls in the wake of the terrorist attacks of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, the police call centre could not cope with the volume of traffic generated by the tsunami&mdash;at times more than 10,000 calls an hour. We are now part of new police call handling arrangements which route emergency calls across their national network; and we are looking at a way to register missing people online, taking some of the load off people staffing the telephones.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/19">I was and remain determined to learn lessons so that our consular crisis management, an area in which the National Audit Office recognised the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as &quot;world leaders&quot;, is the very best it can be.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/20" class="italic">Support for countries affected by the tsunami</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/21">The Government have allocated the equivalent of around &pound;275 million to disaster relief and reconstruction in the tsunami-affected countries, including the Indonesian province of Aceh which took the brunt of the tsunami. This can be broken down into: &pound;75 million of bilateral funds allocated to the humanitarian relief effort; &pound;65 million of bilateral funds to the longer-term reconstruction phase; &pound;50 million through tax relief on public donations made through the Gift Aid scheme; &pound;40 million contributed through the European Union; and &pound;45 million by adding Sri Lanka to the list of countries eligible for the United Kingdom's new multilateral debt relief initiative.</p>

	EU Presidency: Employment and Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-12-13a.114.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100314" speakername="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" colon=":" colnum="114"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51213-40.htm#51213-40_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.114.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, (James Plaskitt):</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/2">The Employment and Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on 8 and <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase> in Brussels. Employment and social policy issues were taken on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase>. Health and consumer affairs were taken on the <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>. The council was chaired by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (John Hutton), apart from the agenda item on the Working Time Directive which was chaired by my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Alan Johnson). I represented the UK seat apart from the Working Time Directive agenda item when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">my honourable friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs (Gerry Sutcliffe)</phrase> took that role.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/3">The first item was a presidency report from the informal meeting of heads of state and Government, Hampton Court, <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase>. The presidency recalled that Hampton Court, in endorsing the Commission's paper on <i>European Values in the globalised world</i>, had agreed a coherent framework for future thinking on social justice, globalisation and demography. The Employment and Social Policy Council would take the lead on following up work on demographic change.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/4">A policy debate on demography and human capital revealed a high degree of consensus on the broad approach. Discussions covered labour market participation, the need to extend working lives, reconciling work and family life, increasing momentum towards gender equality in access to employment, regulated immigration mitigating effects of demographic change and free movement within the EU being achieved before third country immigration. The Commission agreed that all the areas identified by member states were important and must be coordinated into a coherent overall strategy. The presidency concluded that the council would return to this issue during discussions on the joint implementation report in the New Year.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/5">The chairman of the Employment Committee (EMCO) outlined the key conclusions from the examination of national reform programmes. These are the annual reports on each member state's progress towards achieving the Lisbon goals which outline their focused policy objectives. The council noted EMCO's report, and the presidency concluded that EMCO's findings would be useful to the Commission in its preparation of the joint implementation report, and in preparations for the spring council.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/6">The council reached agreement on two dossiers: a partial political agreement on a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS) which involved agreement on all parts of the programme without budgetary implications; and, political agreement on a common position on the gender recast directive which aims to simplify, modernise and improve existing EU law on equal treatment between men and women. The presidency advised that the European Parliament had confirmed its undertaking not to adopt any amendments in second reading if the council adopted the common position on the basis of the text negotiated in the informal discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/7">The commissioner introduced the proposed directive on portability of occupational pensions, which seeks to facilitate the acquisition, transfer and protection of occupational pension rights, with the aim of reducing barriers to worker mobility. The presidency gave some feedback from exchanges in council working groups: a number of issues would need to be addressed before the dossier was ready to be discussed at ministerial level.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/8">There was a lengthy debate on the directive of the European Parliament and of the council amending Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time; the presidency prepared revised texts for discussion and the council almost reached agreement on a package which retained the opt out and solved the doctors' on call issue. However, despite intense negotiation, concerns about clarifying that the limits in the directive apply per worker rather than per job/contract meant this agreement could not finally be reached. The presidency agreed to reflect on the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/9">Under any other business the council noted reports from the presidency on the tenth anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action&mdash;which reviews annually gender equality issues&mdash;and presidency conferences on health and safety, corporate social responsibility, and social inclusion. The council also noted a report from Luxembourg on the 4 European meeting of persons in a situation of poverty, and two information items from the Commission, on the biennial report on disability, and on a memorandum of understanding between the Commission and China on employment and social affairs.</p>
