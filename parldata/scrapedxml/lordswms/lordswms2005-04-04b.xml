	<p pid="b.51.3/1">It is with regret that last Friday my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Jack Straw), decided temporarily to suspend operations in our Embassy in the Ivory Coast with immediate effect. This decision is based on the uncertain security situation and our inability adequately to protect our staff or UK nationals in the case of a further outbreak of violence. But the decision also reflects the lack of progress in the peace process; until leaders truly commit to finding a political solution, there is little point in us remaining.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.3/2">On Friday we changed our travel advice to urge British nationals to leave while there is calm and commercial means are available. Consular and visa services will be provided from Accra.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.3/3">We have informed the government of Ivory Coast of our decision, and that we will review the situation in June.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-04-04b.51.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="51"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050404/text/50404-24.htm#50404-25_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.51.5/1">The Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) is well known to many Members of this House who have committed time and effort to work on behalf of the WFD, promoting democracy around the world through training; sharing experiences; and mentoring. I would like to make particular mention of the efforts of those Members who have served on, or are current members of, the WFD's board, and especially to the honourable Member for Ilford South, the chairman of the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/2">In May 2004, the FCO and WFD commissioned jointly a firm of consultants, River Path Associates, to conduct a full review of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. The review was conducted according to government guidelines on reviewing non-departmental public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/3">The final report of the review has now been presented to me and I am placing copies of it in the Library of the House. The report is also available on the FCO website, <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/4">The Government have considered the recommendations of the review carefully. We are seized in particular of a need for the WFD to operate with proper accountability and transparency. We have decided not to accept the recommendation that the work of the non-political part of the WFD, known as WFD Central, be brought back into the FCO. WFD Central will remain in its current form and the FCO will work with it to continue to improve the effectiveness of WFD Central in building democracy overseas. This decision is based on two points: (i) our judgment that WFD Central deserves recognition for the progress made in recent years; and (ii) the added benefits of conducting democracy building work through an arm's-length body, rather than directly through government.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/5">We have also considered carefully the review's recommendations on the WFD's work with British political parties. We see merit in the recommendation of the reviewer, that this work be funded through Parliament. But this is an important issue and we want to be sure that we reach a decision that has broad support.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/6">To this end I am announcing today the beginning of a three-month consultation exercise on the future of the WFD. I would encourage all Members of both Houses to involve themselves in the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/7">There are two elements to the exercise:</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/8" class="indent">consideration of the River Path Associates report; and</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/9" class="indent">consideration of a response to the report, produced by WFD.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/10">These documents are all available on the FCO website. Alternatively, I would be happy to send copies to Members who write to me to request them.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.5/11">We will also be seeking views from a wide-range of others in the consultation process. We will particularly target those who know the WFD, but will also welcome views from specialists in democracy promotion from within the UK and abroad. I would encourage Members to make this exercise known to those they believe might be interested in commenting.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.1/1">The Government warmly welcome United Nations Secretary-General Annan's report <i>In Larger Freedom</i>, released in New York on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/2">As my right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) and International Development Secretary (Mr Hilary Benn) said in a joint press statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">Monday 21 March</phrase>, the report offers bold proposals to enable the UN to deal with the challenges faced by the international community. We agree with Kofi Annan that we need a shared global agenda that recognises that security, development and human rights are not competing priorities, but fundamentally interrelated goals, underpinned by rule of law. Nations will never be truly secure unless they are built on stable institutions, social progress and development, the rights of the individual and rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/3">We are studying the report carefully and hope that it will lead to a successful outcome at the UN Millennium Review Summit in New York in September. We intend to play a major role in helping deliver a successful outcome, not least as G8&mdash;and from July, EU&mdash;Presidency.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/4">We strongly support the SG's lead in putting key issues on the agenda for leaders in September, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/5" class="indent">the need for action now to make faster progress towards the millennium development goals, including on related sustainable development commitments, and to improve human rights;</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/6" class="indent">support for: increased aid and launch this year of the International Finance Facility; the recommendations of the Prime Minister's Commission for Africa; and UK ideas for more effective international responses to natural and man-made humanitarian crises;</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/7" class="indent">more effective support for countries emerging from conflict, including in particular through the establishment of a new Peacebuilding Commission; and</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/8" class="indent">the development of comprehensive strategies to meet threat of terrorism and proliferation.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/9">The Government will make a full contribution to the summit and its preparations. Our G8 priorities&mdash;on Africa and climate change&mdash;reflect key themes on the UN summit agenda. We hope that the Gleneagles summit will help build momentum for a successful UN summit.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/10">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has launched, with the UN Association, an extensive public debate on the Secretary General's earlier High Level Panel report aimed at informing our approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/11">I have placed copies of the <i>In Larger Freedom</i> report in the Library of the House. It is also available on the internet at <a href="http://www.un.org/largerfreedom">www.un.org/largerfreedom</a>.</p>

	Palestine: Security

	<p pid="b.57.1/1">In my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-02">2 March</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>WS 14</i>), I informed noble Lords of the outcomes of the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March</phrase> London meeting in support of the Palestinians. In respect of security sector reform the international community committed itself to providing financial support to re-equip the security services; establishing a fund for early retirement of security personnel; and helping to address the cost of pensions for security officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/2">In his Written Answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1189" name="Angus Robertson">the honourable Member for Moray (Mr Angus Robertson)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-03">3 February</phrase> (<i>Official Report</i>, House of Commons, col. 1109), <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/693" name="Douglas Alexander">my honourable friend the Minister for Trade and Investment (Mr Douglas Alexander)</phrase> set out our on-going assistance to the Palestinians to improve the performance of their security forces, through provision of technical assistance and equipment. On <phrase class="date" code="">23 December</phrase> we informed Parliament, by means of a departmental minute, of a gift of equipment to the Palestinian Central Intervention Forces (CIF) to help them provide public order security for the <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase> presidential elections and beyond. In the event, the CIF were disbanded as part of Palestinian moves towards rationalising their security services and members returned to their original units, notably the National Security Forces. Officials from the Consulate General in Jerusalem and the Embassy in Tel Aviv have kept in close contact with Palestinian security officials to ensure that the equipment supplied (communications equipment, tents, uniforms and office equipment) will be used effectively by Palestinian security forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/3">The Palestinian security forces, including the civil police, with whom we have also been working, performed well in the run-up to, and during, the <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase> elections, when security was good.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/4">We had intended to donate 20 cars to the CIF but the delivery of these was delayed and did not take place before disbandment of the CIF. We have waited until after the London meeting to see how Palestinian security sector reform was likely to progress and have now decided to give the cars to the National Security Forces, units of which will play a security role similar to that envisaged for the CIF. We have received assurances from the Palestinian Minister of the Interior on the use to which these cars will be put. A recently appointed military liaison officer from the MoD is working closely with the NSF to improve their capacity. He has identified a shortage of transport as one of their strategic weaknesses and will monitor closely the deployment of these vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/5">We are working closely with US security co-ordinator General Ward who is leading the quartet's oversight committee on security. We will continue, in co-ordination with General Ward and the rest of the international community, to assist the Palestinian security sector to improve its capacity to maintain public order security and prevent terrorist attacks, in the crucial period leading up to the proposed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in July, and beyond.</p>
