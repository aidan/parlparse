	<p pid="a.133.1/3">As the House has previously been informed, the business of this important committee has been managed by Sir John Blelloch since the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, stepped down as chairman on health grounds in March this year. I wish to thank him for generously agreeing to extend his service further for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/4">The Government intend to refresh the membership of the committee over the coming months. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, who is currently serving on the committee, has agreed to step into the role of chairman in this interim period.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/2">In July 2007, the Prime Minister asked my right honourable friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" name="Adam Ingram">the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr Ingram)</phrase> to undertake a detailed study into the role of the Ministry of Defence in counterterrorism and resilience.

	<p pid="a.134.1/3">His study provides a thorough analysis of the Ministry of Defence's role and of the capabilities it brings to bear in support of the Government's counterterrorism strategy&mdash;CONTEST&mdash;and domestic resilience. It reinforces a central theme of the national security strategy&mdash;that security threats and hazards are intertwined, with no simple distinctions between defence and wider security and between domestic and overseas considerations. It endorses the direction in which the Government are moving the security agenda, and it makes a number of recommendations as to how the Ministry of Defence could further refine its support in these important areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/4">Given the sensitive nature of the study, its classification prevents its publication. The Government will respond to it once they have had the opportunity to consider the recommendations.</p>

	Courts: Disclosure in Expert Evidence
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-22a.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="135"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80722-wms0001.htm#80722-wms0001.htm_spmin10">
	<p pid="a.135.1/1">My honourable friend the Solicitor-General (Vera Baird) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-20">20 February 2007</phrase> the then Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, announced a review of criminal cases in which Dr David Southall had been a prosecution witness. The General Medical Council (GMC) had started a hearing to examine allegations that Dr Southall had kept so-called special case (SC) files containing original medical records relating to his patients that were not also kept on the child's official hospital file. These files relate to the period 1980-2000. Concerns had been expressed that in some of those cases criminal proceedings may have been brought but the existence of the files not revealed, resulting in their not being available for disclosure as part of the prosecution process.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">It was not clear at that stage whether there had been any such failures to discharge disclosure obligations. Lord Goldsmith decided to assess cases in which Dr Southall had been instructed as a prosecution witness to determine whether he had kept a separate SC file, and if so to determine what further review might be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/4">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) undertook that assessment, establishing a project board and a review team under the leadership of a chief Crown prosecutor. The review team:</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/5">identified criminal prosecutions to which individual SC files could be linked;retrieved original prosecution files;reviewed the SC files against the contents of the associated prosecution files to assess whether there were any grounds for concern as to whether the obligations of disclosure to the defence had been fully discharged; andreported their findings to the Attorney-General.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/6">Dr Southall provided all the SC files he held&mdash;a total of 4,344 files&mdash;in accordance with his undertaking to the GMC. Of the 4,344 SC files reviewed by the team, 82 were found to be linked to court proceedings of some kind. Of those, 40 were established to have been associated with a criminal prosecution conducted in this jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/7">The review team then checked CPS records against these 40 SC files and identified a total of seven CPS prosecution files linked with a total of nine SC files. On reviewing these files in depth, the team found no grounds to suggest that there had been a failure to comply with the prosecution's obligations of disclosure to the defence. Accordingly the review team has advised, and the Attorney-General and I accept, that there is no reason to indicate that any of these cases needs to be referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/8">The ability of the review team to identify whether an SC file was linked with a prosecution, and then to locate the original prosecution papers, was constrained by a number of wholly practical factors. The team had to rely on the contents of the SC file for information suggesting that there might be linked criminal proceedings. In some older cases where there was such a link, the prosecution file no longer existed because of the application of the normal procedures for file destruction within the CPS after set periods of time. Differences between the methods of identifying SC files (which were linked to the patient) and CPS prosecution files (recorded by the name of the defendant) also made linking SC files to prosecution files difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/9">None the less this review has been a valuable and worthwhile exercise. The review team has approached its task conscientiously and with care and thoroughness, for which the Attorney-General and I thank them.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/10">The report makes a number of recommendations designed to reinforce the message that expert witnesses must fully understand their responsibilities in relation to the disclosure of information in criminal cases. These are explained in the CPS/ACPO <I>Guidance Booklet for Experts</I>. The report's recommendations have been accepted and are being taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/11">Recommendation 7 is that the Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) should consider whether to conduct a similar review in relation to possible disclosure failings in family court proceedings. The DCSF has now considered this recommendation&mdash;it agrees that there should be such a review and that it is the appropriate department to conduct it. The review will focus on the 82 SC files which the review team found were linked to court proceedings of some kind. Thirty-six of these were definitely linked to family proceedings. It is to be noted that if a disclosure failure were detected, this may, or may not, have any impact on the case, bearing in mind the passage of time and the fact that the welfare of the child is paramount in family proceedings. However, the DCSF will follow the recommendation of the review team and conduct a review of the family cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/12">The review team's report and recommendations (edited to preserve the anonymity of individual patients) have today been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">Yesterday, I wrote to the chair of the DCSF Select Committee to update him on the position with the return of national curriculum test results to schools, placing a copy of the letter in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3">Further results have been released to schools by ETS Europe this morning, taking the total of scripts marked and released to over 98 per cent of marks at key stage 2 and some 88 per cent in key stage 3 &mdash;94.1 per cent in maths, 93.4 per cent in science and 76.9 per cent in English.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/4">The QCA confirmed in a statement over the weekend that it is in discussions with ETS Europe following the unacceptable delays in delivering this year's national curriculum test results. These discussions are highly sensitive&mdash;legally and financially&mdash;and, as I set out to the House yesterday, it is very important that the QCA should be allowed to conclude them in a timely and orderly fashion in order to safeguard the interests of pupils, schools and taxpayers. Ministerial intervention, at this stage, would be totally inappropriate and would jeopardise the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/5">I shall continue to update Parliament regularly over the coming weeks on progress with release of results and Ofqual's work on marking quality. I will write regularly with an update to the chair of the Select Committee, copying the letter to opposition spokespeople and the Speaker and placing a copy of the letter in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/6">At the same time, and following my oral report to the Select Committee last week, Lord Sutherland has started work on his independent inquiry and will be collecting evidence in August and September before reporting publicly (when the House returns) in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (John Hutton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/2">It was announced in the 2008 White Paper on nuclear power that the Government would publish a public consultation on the strategic siting assessment (SSA) process and criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/3">I have today issued a consultation document on the SSA process and criteria. Alongside this, the Government are publishing a study of the environmental and sustainability effects of the siting of new nuclear power stations in accordance with the proposed SSA criteria.

The Government are also publishing today a habitats regulations assessment screening report and the environmental study appendices.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/4">This is a step towards the development of a new nuclear national policy statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/5">The consultation will close on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-11">11 November 2008</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.139.3/1">The Justice and Home Affairs Council will be held on 24 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-25">25 July 2008</phrase> in Brussels. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Justice (Bridget Prentice), my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office (Meg Hillier) and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in Scotland (Kenny McAskill) will attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands, the following items will be discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/2">The morning of the council will focus on asylum and immigration business, starting with a state of play report on the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum. The pact covers five areas: legal migration of third-country nationals, illegal immigration and returns; border controls; asylum; and partnership with countries of origin and transit (the global approach). The presidency is seeking agreement on the pact in time for the <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-15">15 October</phrase> European Council. We support the strong focus on immigration and asylum issues under the French presidency and will use this as a basis for stronger practical co-operation in the EU. The Government are generally content with the pact but will continue to work with the presidency on the detail of the final document.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/3">There will follow a discussion on the directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment (commonly known as the EU Blue Card), which aims to set admission conditions for highly skilled migrants. It also proposes to determine the conditions in which third-country nationals who are legally residing in a member state under the proposal may reside with their family members in other member states. The French presidency is aiming for political agreement at the September JHA Council. The UK has not opted into this measure since it does not fit with the UK's points-based system.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/4">The presidency is seeking an agreement to the directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals by member states. The UK chose not to opt into this directive as a result of concerns in relation to the proposed definition of employer, a notification requirement and inspections. However, the UK is seeking to influence discussions in order to amend the text in a manner which would allow a review of our opt-in position post-adoption of the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/5">The council will be asked to agree conclusions on the taking-in of Iraqi refugees by member states. The Government strongly agree that member states should be able to determine their own resettlement policies. The UK will continue to resettle Iraqi refugees under our established policies and selection criteria and does not consider common resettlement criteria to be feasible. We support sharing good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/6">The presidency would like to reach a general approach on the directive amending directive 2003/109/EC to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international protection. The UK has chosen not to opt into the proposed directive as we believe it is not in line with our frontiers protocol. We want to determine the status of third-country nationals via the UK's Immigration Rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/7">The council then reverts to discussions on interior business, starting with the Mixed Committee with Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. The presidency will present a state of play report on the draft regulation amending common consular instructions on visas for diplomatic and consular posts in relation to the introduction of biometrics. Although the United Kingdom does not participate in issuing Schengen visas, we welcome the efforts of Schengen member states in ensuring that the Schengen external EU borders are as secure as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/8">The Commission will also update the council on the state of play of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II). The presidency will also look to agree the council regulation and council decision on the migration of SISI+ to SIS II.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/9">Under any other business in Mixed Committee, the Commission will present its communication on visa reciprocity. Although the United Kingdom does not participate in the EU common visa policy, the United Kingdom will continue to support the principle of reciprocity and extending the US visa waiver program to all EU member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/10">The presidency intends to present its proposed working method on the passenger name records framework decision to the council. Its approach will focus on seeking agreement on the key issues of the dossier, namely scope, the depth of harmonisation necessary, data protection and relations with third countries. The presidency will also suggest that there should be consultation with data protection authorities, the European Parliament and carriers. The UK is in broad agreement with this approach and welcomes the ambitious programme of work outlined in the French proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/11">The presidency will present the final reports of the Future Groups on Home Affairs and on Justice, which aim to provide input to the new JHA work programme that will replace the Hague programme at the end of 2009. The Government see these reports as one element among several that should feed the debate on the direction of the new work programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/12">The presidency will propose taking forward work to improve co-operation in tackling cybercrime. The UK supports action in this area to promote co-operation between private industry and public authorities, as well as between law enforcement. We will work with the presidency to develop its ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/13">On the morning of the second day, the council will move to justice issues. The presidency will seek political agreement on the council decision on strengthening Eurojust. This instrument aims to improve the efficiency of Eurojust, including by giving national members a minimum set of powers and increasing the flow of information between national competent authorities and Eurojust. The Government are content with the outcome of negotiations and believe the draft strikes a good balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/14">The French presidency will also seek political agreement on the council decision amending the European judicial network. This instrument is intended to update and replace the 1998 joint action which established the European judicial network and take account of subsequent developments in EU judicial co-operation, including the establishment of Eurojust in 2002. The Government are generally content with what is proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/15">The presidency will present a proposal for a council decision on the establishment of the European criminal records information system (ECRIS). There will be a policy debate on this measure which aims to find a standardised format for exchange of the content of a conviction, as well as other general and technical implementation aspects of the information exchange. The Government strongly support this measure in so far as it aims to improve and speed up the arrangements for exchanging information on past convictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/16">There will be a policy debate about the Rome III regulation (choice of law in divorce). The UK did not opt into the negotiations on this proposal. Member states have been unable to reach agreement on the measure, and some now wish to proceed by way of enhanced co-operation. The treaty provides for this, as a last resort, where eight or more states wish to participate in something that falls within Community competence but cannot be attained within a reasonable period. If it went ahead, it would be first use of enhanced co-operation. There is no expectation that the UK will participate and the Government do not intend to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.3/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister (Gordon Brown MP) has made the following Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/2">I have today laid before both Houses the annual reports of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Christopher Rose (HC 659), of the Interception of Communications Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Paul Kennedy (HC 947) and of the Intelligence Services Commissioner, the right honourable Sir Peter Gibson (HC 948).</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/3">The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) established the regulatory framework for the use of a wide range of investigatory techniques. It sets out the purposes for which the powers can be used, the public authorities that can use them, the authorisation procedures that they must follow and the use that can be made of the material obtained. It also provides for an appropriate oversight regime and a means of redress through the independent Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The reports that I have laid before Parliament today set out how the RIPA investigatory powers have been used during the periods covered.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/4">The Government continue to believe that the existing system of authorisations, inspections and other safeguards set out in RIPA is appropriate, and welcome the valuable oversight role discharged by the commissioners appointed under the RIPA. The independent oversight that they provide is vital in ensuring that the various powers are used appropriately and only when necessary and proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/5">The Interception Commissioner's report notes that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal reached determinations on 83 cases during the period covered. The tribunal did not uphold any complaints during this period. A great deal has been done already to improve public authorities' awareness of the obligations placed on them, and to ensure that proper consideration is given to necessity and proportionality. We recognise, however, that there is always more that can be done. The Government are reviewing those public authorities that have access to these powers to ensure that they have a continuing and justifiable requirement for them. On completion, the Government will list the authorities that can use each of the powers and the purposes for which they can use them, and set out revised statutory codes of practice, which Parliament will have the opportunity to debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/6">I am grateful to Sir Christopher, Sir Paul and Sir Peter, and to their support staff, for their work on these thorough reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.7/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-19">19 March</phrase>, I published the United Kingdom's first ever <I>National Security Strategy</I>. It set out how we proposed to address and manage an increasingly diverse but interconnected set of security challenges and some of their underlying factors including climate change, competition for energy, poverty and globalisation. The aim is to safeguard the nation, its citizens, our prosperity and our way of life, against a constantly changing security environment. I want to update the House on arrangements for support to the National Security Committee and proposals for parliamentary oversight of the delivery of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.7/3">As envisaged in the <I>National Security Strategy</I>, the Government will be establishing a National Security Forum. We want to promote a constructive and informed dialogue with experts, stakeholders and the public to understand the security challenges we face and how we need to tackle them. The forum will have a core group of 12 publicly appointed members reflecting the broad range of the subject areas in the <I>National Security Strategy</I>. It is likely to include people with a range of experience and expertise in these issues; and, in addition to this core group, we will create a register of up to 100 expert associates who could be called upon to provide advice in specific areas. The purpose of the forum will be to provide expert advice to the National Security Committee (Cabinet Committee on National Security, International Relations and Development (NSID)). It will be invited to focus on the published strategy to inform the annual updates, although it will be able to commission its own research subject to agreement of its programme by NSID.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.7/4">In advance of setting up the forum as a non-departmental public body, I will be establishing an interim forum in the early autumn. For the interim forum only, the Government will appoint its members, on advice from the Cabinet Office. Though an interim body, it will begin substantive work immediately. The chair of the interim body will be announced shortly. The National Security Forum will be supported by a new National Security Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. Alongside that, a Horizon Scanning Unit will be established which will co-ordinate the security-related horizon scanning currently undertaken in a number of government departments, with the intention of giving it an overarching framework and a more coherent output.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.7/5">It is important that we have the right form of parliamentary oversight of the <I>National Security Strategy</I> and its delivery. There are already a number of Select Committees, and the Intelligence and Security Committee, who have an interest in the development and implementation of the <I>National Security Strategy</I>; and any new arrangement should not duplicate their existing scrutiny work. I propose therefore to consult the parliamentary authorities and the Opposition through the usual channels about the establishment and terms of reference of a joint committee on the <I>National Security Strategy</I>, comprising the chairs of the key departmental Select Committees with an interest in national security, and other Members of Parliament and Peers with particular interests or experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.7/6">In March, I said that the Government would publish a &quot;national level risk register setting out our assessment of the likelihood and potential impact of a range of different risks that may directly affect the UK&quot;. We will be writing shortly to the chairs of the relevant Select Committees with our National Risk Register and placing copies in the library of the House. Its purpose is specifically to give the public information about risks to the UK from natural disasters, accidents and malicious threats over the next five years so that those who wish to can prepare for the consequences. The National Risk Register will be a key tool in the development of community resilience networks, another <I>National Security Strategy</I> deliverable, which the Cabinet Office will be taking forward in the coming months and is the next step in improving the UK's resilience.</p>

The figures cover the number of jobs created and safeguarded, the number of people assisted to get a job, the amount of brownfield land brought back into use, the number of businesses created, the number of businesses assisted to improve their performance, the number of people assisted in their skills development and the amount of public and private sector regeneration infrastructure investment levered, all as a result of RDA activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.147.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Parmjit Dhanda) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/2">The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is today publishing proposed changes to the regional spatial strategy (RSS) for the east Midlands (the east Midlands plan). They follow the public examination held between May and July 2007 and the panel report published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-28">28 November 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/3">The panel report endorsed the strategy set out in the draft RSS, but made numerous recommendations to clarify and improve it. The Secretary of State has considered all the panel's recommendations, along with other relevant evidence, together with updates to the sustainability appraisal and a habitats regulations assessment. The main changes proposed are:</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/4">increased housing growth across the region to 21,750 per year for the period 2006-26. Much of the additional growth is proposed in and around the main cities of Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, recognising growth related to growth point agreements in those cities and surrounding areas (the three cities growth point) and in other growth point agreements at Lincoln, Newark and Grantham;no change to growth area plans in Northamptonshire, which were set in the Milton Keynes and south Midlands sub-regional strategy in 2005, though the plan period for the area is extended to 2026 and the housing provision figure for Northampton is replaced following a successful legal challenge (in 2006) which quashed the original figure;reduction in housing provision in Lincolnshire coastal districts (East Lindsey, Boston and South Holland) pending a coastal strategy being agreed which will consider growth needs and flood-risk implications;a new policy relating to affordable housing in rural areas has been added and increased pitch requirements for Gypsies and Travellers are proposed;rejection of the panel's recommendation to delete green-belt areas around Nottingham; and removal of site-specific references to major development sites around Nottingham, Leicester and Lincoln.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/5">I have today written to the East Midlands Regional Assembly with the proposed changes, which will be published today on the Government Office for the East Midlands website at <a href="http://www.goem.gov.uk">www.goem.gov.uk</a> and distributed to interested people and organisations across the region. There will now be a public consultation period of 12 weeks on the proposed changes, which will end on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-17">17 October</phrase>. Copies of the relevant documents will be placed in the Library of the House and will be sent to all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Iain Wright) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities is today publishing proposed changes to the draft revisions of the regional spatial strategy for the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/3">The regional spatial strategy forms part of the statutory development plan for every local authority in the south-west and sets the framework for the production of local development frameworks and local transport plans. It provides the spatial plan for the development of the region, and provides the policy framework for employment, housing, transport and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/4">The current strategy, initially published as regional planning guidance, became the regional spatial strategy in September 2004 with the enactment of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. A draft revision of the regional spatial strategy was submitted to the Government in April 2006 by the South West Regional Assembly. It was subsequently tested in an examination in public (EIP) between April and July 2007 and the report of the independent panel which conducted this examination was published in January this year. The Secretary of State has considered the recommendations of the independent panel which held the EIP and has taken into account the representations made on the draft revision, and changes in government policy since the draft revision was submitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/5">Today's publication of the Secretary of State's proposed changes now represents the commencement of a public consultation of 12 weeks. Also being published are the report of a sustainability appraisal of the proposed changes and a habitats regulations assessment. Following consideration of the responses to the consultation, the Secretary of State expects to publish the finalised regional spatial strategy for the south-west by the end of the year. On final publication, it will supersede the current RSS.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/6">In writing to the regional assembly to give notice of the publication of proposed changes, I have drawn particular attention to the need for further work by both the region and the Government on the infrastructure required to deliver the strategy. Copies of the relevant documents have been placed in the Library of the House and have been provided for all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>

	Terrorism: Hazardous Substances
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-22a.152.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="152"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80722-wms0005.htm#80722-wms0005.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.152.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minster for Security, Counterterrorism, Crime and Policing (Tony McNulty) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/2">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced in his Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase> a review of what more we need to do to strengthen security to protect against the use of hazardous substances for terrorist purposes. This review has been completed. I do not intend to publish it, because I do not wish in any way to compromise our security. However, this Statement provides a summary of the main conclusions of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/3">The review shows that a substantial amount of work has been undertaken in this area. It also identifies areas where further improvements could be made but recognises that we must ensure that protective security measures are proportionate to the risk. We need to ensure that individuals and businesses are free to carry on normal social, economic and democratic activities and, as a result, there will always be some vulnerability to the use of hazardous substances for terrorist purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/4">First, it is important to underline that considerable progress has already been made in recent years to reduce our vulnerability to the use of hazardous substances for terrorist purposes. The National Counter Terrorism Security Office (NaCTSO) provides specialist advice regarding the security of a variety of hazardous substances. It has undertaken a range of activities to reduce the vulnerability of hazardous substances. These include &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; campaigns, to raise awareness about the &quot;dual-use&quot; nature of certain products and encouraging suppliers to be more inquiring of new customers and to report suspicious enquiries to police. NaCTSO has also played an important role in overseeing local police counterterrorism security advisers who implement Part 7 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which provides the police with powers to impose security measures at laboratories that hold certain dangerous pathogens and toxins.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/5">The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) is the government authority on protective security in relation to national security threats. The CPNI works with NaCTSO to advise businesses and organisations on the security of hazardous substances and sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/6">The Environment Agency has managed a government-subsidised programme that has disposed of more than 9,000 disused radioactive sources from hospitals, universities, museums, schools and other sites across the UK. The Environment Agency, and its sister agencies in Scotland and Northern Ireland, working in partnership with NaCTSO, are also regulating the security of radioactive sources used at hospitals, universities and industrial sites throughout the UK. This review did not cover those nuclear or radiological materials used in the civil nuclear sector, as they fall under the specific regulatory regime led by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/7">The Transport Security and Contingencies Directorate of the Department for Transport (Transec) enforces a statutory regime for the security of dangerous goods in transit. The Department for Transport's Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) carries out inspections of vehicles at the roadside, and of road depots, on behalf of Transec. Transec's own inspectors carry out compliance activity for the movement of dangerous goods by rail in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/8">The Government also welcome the steps that industry has been taking, through a knowledge of its customers and through codes of conduct, to help reduce the chances of abuse of hazardous substances. For instance, the UK Fertiliser Industry has developed, at the request of the UK Government, the Fertiliser Industry Assurance Scheme (FIAS).</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/9">The main outcome of the review is a new risk-based strategic framework to drive prioritisation of work to reduce the accessibility of hazardous substances for terrorist purposes. This will enable work to focus on reducing the accessibility of hazardous substances considered to be at highest risk, taking account of the need for a proportionate, cost-effective and practical response. This will allow us to target resources where most needed and to improve the security of hazardous substances even further.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/10">The framework will direct a cross-government programme of work to reduce the vulnerability of highest risk substances. This programme will be delivered under the &quot;protect&quot; strand of the Government's counterterrorism strategy (CONTEST) and will be led by the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism in the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/11">This framework has prioritised hazardous substances on the basis of the risk that they pose, taking account of the threat, vulnerability and impact of those substances. The review examined the vulnerability of substances across their life cycle, from their precursors through to their disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/12">We are reviewing the pathogens and toxins listed under Schedule 5 to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 with the assistance of the Health Protection Agency. We are also considering whether further legislative changes are required to clarify the scope of the application of the legislation and will consult on any proposed changes in due course as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/13">Another example of specific work under way as a result of the review is a joint Department for Transport/Home Office project, which has been established to agree an impact-based list of substances of most concern, to inform our assessment of the risk and to identify areas for further reduction of the vulnerability of these substances throughout the supply chain, including transportation.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/14">We will continue to reduce the risks from the illicit transportation of hazardous substances at the UK border. We will build upon existing initiatives such as Programme Cyclamen, which provides radiation-screening capability at UK points of entry to prevent the illicit importation of radiological substances, and we will use the strategic framework to inform counterterrorism requirements at the UK border, in conjunction with the UK Border Agency, the national co-ordinator of ports policing and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/15">We are also considering what further work may be appropriate to reduce the vulnerability of hazardous sites and substances to insider action. This will build on existing work led by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and take account of the findings of the independent review of personnel security in the transport sector by Stephen Boys Smith.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/16">In taking forward this work, the Government recognise the importance of engaging fully with industry and academia. In particular, we are committed to working with them to identify proportionate, risk-based measures. Equally important is the need to work with international partners to reduce the risk of terrorists acquiring hazardous substances. For example, we are currently working with our European partners to reduce the availability of high-grade ammonium nitrate fertiliser.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/17">Taken together, the various recommendations of the review will further reduce the risk of terrorists obtaining hazardous substances and will increase the likelihood that those attempting to access such materials will be detected.</p>

	Transport: Personnel
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2008-07-22a.154.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="154"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80722-wms0005.htm#80722-wms0005.htm_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.154.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/2">Last December I commissioned an independent review of personnel security across the transport sector. This followed Lord West's review last year which focused on physical infrastructure and confirmed that, although it is impossible to eliminate every risk, a robust transport security regime is in place. The review of personnel security was conducted by Stephen Boys Smith who has now delivered his report. It contains a detailed assessment of current security processes and recommendations of where changes might be needed. Because of the sensitive nature of the subject matter, it is not appropriate to publish it in full, but I have published a short summary of the report, and of its key recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/3">The Government and the transport industries are committed to countering the threat from terrorism. The existing security regime encompasses a wide range of measures which seek to reduce the potential threat from insiders. These measures include both personnel security measures, such as background checks, and physical security measures, such as the searching and screening requirements. Many of these physical security measures apply to industry staff as well as passengers. For instance, the UK requires airports to screen 100 per cent of staff working in the restricted zone, and has played a leading role in ensuring that this approach has been incorporated into European regulations, as well as promoting it elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/4">Stephen Boys Smith's report acknowledges the effectiveness of the UK transport security regime, which overlaps multiple layers of security measures in this way. But the report also points out that the more effectively the security regime mitigates external threats, the more likely it becomes that terrorists will look for vulnerabilities elsewhere. I therefore agree with the key message of the report: that there should be an increased focus on personnel security and that this should be informed by systematic analysis of the risks. This is consistent with work already in hand within the Government's counterterrorism strategy, CONTEST, where personnel security is one of the work streams.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/5">The most important challenge will be to integrate fully a risk-based approach to personnel security into industry practices. This clearly cannot be delivered by the Government alone. Only the industry has the detailed knowledge of its operations and systems that is needed accurately to identify the specific personnel security risks that it faces and how they might be mitigated. But the Government have a vital role to play in raising awareness of personnel security issues within the industry, providing guidance and support to the industry, and ensuring that full and rigorous assessments are carried out and that appropriate action is taken where vulnerabilities are identified</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/6">For this reason, I have asked my department to ensure with immediate effect that industry's attention is drawn to the advice which is already available (for example, that issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure), and to enhance the personnel security elements of our existing training programmes. Alongside this, my officials will urgently work up policy options over the summer for a cross-industry conference, to be held in the autumn. This conference will identify the most effective approaches to embedding risk assessment in the personnel security regime. The next phase will be for government and industry to work together, including through ongoing working groups such as the National Aviation Security Committee, to ensure that the necessary risk assessments are carried out and a clear programme of work delivered. This will require sustained effort by all.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/7">I agree with the report's view that identity is a key factor in personnel security regimes and note its conclusion that ID cards are a useful addition to identity assurance. This endorses the announcement by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-06">6 March</phrase> that ID cards will be part of the identity assurance regime for airside workers, starting in 2009. Officials from the Home Office and my department are currently in discussion with the industry about how best to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/8">I also accept the report's advice that, in the light of experience both in the Security Industry Association (SIA) and within some sectors of the transport industry, overseas criminal record checks are now a more viable option than they have been in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/9">While checks of this kind are primarily intended to reduce crime, they can also provide a useful additional check on an applicant's integrity as part of the overall personnel security regime. I have therefore asked my department to produce clear guidance, building on the approach taken by the SIA, to support those organisations whose risk assessments identify posts for which checks of this kind are necessary. Wherever such posts are identified, I expect the industry to take rapid action, and my department will be engaging closely with them over the coming months to ensure that this is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/10">Alongside this voluntary approach, which extends existing good practice in the industry, I believe there is also a case for introducing a mandatory requirement for those posts which present the highest risks, such as those with specific security responsibilities (and which are already subject to a counterterrorism check). However, before such a requirement can be put in place, there remain a number of legal and practical challenges to be overcome. These including identifying an effective means of dealing with the variability of international criminal records systems and documentation, and developing an approach which does not have undue implications for the ongoing efficiency and security of industry operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/11">I have therefore asked my department to begin immediate discussions with employers and employees in the industry to agree a workable and effective approach to introducing such a requirement, with a view to implementation by the end of the year. In line with Stephen Boys Smith's recommendation, I expect this to apply to new applicants for these posts, as employers can assess the integrity of existing employees in other, more effective ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/12">Over the longer term, as the exchange of information between countries becomes more efficient, it may be appropriate to extend this requirement to other posts. I note here also the Statement made on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-16">16 July</phrase> by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary about Sir Ian Magee's review of criminality and the potential for overseas information to be more readily available to UK criminal record offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/13">Finally, I agree with the view that while there should be some rebalancing of priorities between physical and personnel security activity, this should not result in a weakening of physical security programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/14">Copies of the report summary and recommendations have been laid in the Libraries of both Houses and will appear on the department's website.</p>
