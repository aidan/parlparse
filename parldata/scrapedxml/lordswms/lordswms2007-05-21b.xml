	<p pid="b.27.1/2">I am pleased to announce today that the MoD has placed an order with BAE Systems to commence work on the build of the fourth submarine in the Astute class, which will be known as &quot;Audacious&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.1/3">The Astute class is the next generation of nuclear-powered attack submarines. The first of class, &quot;Astute&quot;, is on schedule to be launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-08">8 June 2007</phrase>, and is due to enter service in 2009. The Astute class will be the largest, most capable and most widely deployable attack submarines that the Royal Navy has ever operated, and will replace the Swiftsure and Trafalgar classes which have been in service since the 1970s and 1980s respectively. The Astute class will have improved communications systems to support joint operations and an enhanced ability to operate in shallower littoral environments. BAES (submarine solutions) is also responsible for the design and build of the first three boats (&quot;Astute&quot;, &quot;Ambush&quot; and &quot;Artful&quot;).</p>
