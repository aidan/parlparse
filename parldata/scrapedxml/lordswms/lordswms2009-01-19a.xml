EDF will transfer this amount to NLF by <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">Monday 19 January 2009</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.156.3/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.3/2">Yesterday, on the day of a long-awaited ceasefire, I announced an additional pledge of up to &pound;20 million for humanitarian needs in Gaza, bringing the UK's response to the crisis in Gaza to nearly &pound;27 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.3/3">These additional funds are already being spent. Yesterday evening, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Mike Foster, announced a contribution of &pound;4 million to the International Committee for the Red Cross to carry out immediate work to save lives such as providing medical treatment to the injured. Today I am announcing &pound;1 million to the World Food Programme to co-ordinate the relief items brought to Gaza by the UN and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.3/4">Despite the ceasefire, access for humanitarian agencies will continue to be a major challenge. We will need to do everything we can to ensure that humanitarian agencies have full and safe access to provide help to those who need it. The international community also needs to move quickly to carry out an urgent needs assessment so that the slow process of rebuilding Gaza can start. The UK Government will work closely with all its international partners in these efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.3/5">This &pound;20 million is in addition to our Paris pledge of up to &pound;243 million in aid to the Palestinian people over three years and the &pound;6.8 million in humanitarian assistance to Gaza that I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.1/1">My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Jack Straw) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/2">I am today publishing the Ministry of Justice corporate plan for 2009-11. This, our first corporate plan, is the culmination of a huge amount of work to provide clarity on what the department, only 20 months old, will achieve over the remainder of the spending review period, how and with what resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/3">The plan is based around our four strategic objectives and explains how we will:</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/4">create a momentum of reform across the justice system with front-line staff working in partnership with local communities to bring about change;build on our good work involving communities in justice so we are more responsive to how the public want their justice system to develop;ensure justice is not only done, but is seen to be done; andensure that the voice of those who suffer most from the impact of crime&mdash;victims&mdash;is heard in all aspects of our work.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/5">Like other government departments, we will make significant savings over this spending period, while continuing to improve the services we deliver to the public. The plan sets out our internal financial allocations for the next financial year and explains how we will improve performance, drive out duplication, and ensure we have the capabilities to deliver our plan within our resource envelope. Copies of the corporate plan have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/6">In the short time since it was created, the Ministry of Justice has been leading reform across the justice system. This plan sets out an exciting agenda for the next phase of reform, which will ensure our justice system remains admired and emulated across the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/2">I am today announcing the decapitalisation rates to be used in the &quot;contractor's method of valuation&quot; in non-domestic rating valuations in England for the 2010 revaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/3">Rateable values are assessed independently by the Valuation Office Agency and are generally based on annual rental values. Most are assessed having regard to actual rents but such evidence is not always available. In about 11 per cent of cases, rateable value is based on capital values, established from the cost of construction and land values, which is then &quot;decapitalised&quot; to give an annual value representing the rateable value. This is called the &quot;contractor's method of valuation&quot;. The decapitalisation rates used in the valuation are prescribed by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/4">Following consultation in the summer, I have decided:</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/5">to continue to prescribe the decapitalisation rates for the 2010 revaluation;to retain the existing groupings of properties subject to each of the two decapitalisation rates; and to retain the existing rates at 3.33 per cent for education, healthcare and Ministry of Defence properties and 5 per cent for all other properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/6">I have set the rates having regard to the relevant factors outlined in the consultation paper. Those factors suggest that the range of possible outcomes for the decapitalisation rates remains very wide and that the existing rates are broadly in the middle of that range.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/7">The 2010 revaluation is being undertaken by the Valuation Office Agency. Rateable values will be published by <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-01">1 October 2009</phrase>.</p>
