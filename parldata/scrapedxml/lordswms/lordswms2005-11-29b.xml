	Azerbaijan and Armenia: Arms Embargo
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-29b.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="5"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51129-31.htm#51129-31_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.5.1/1">The Government remain committed to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe arms embargo against both Azerbaijan and Armenia, which we interpret as covering all goods and technology controlled under entries in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 (commonly known as the military list).</p>
	<p pid="b.5.1/2">In November 2005, the Government approved an export licence application for bomb disposal clothing and equipment for the Special State Protection Service in Azerbaijan.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.1/3">The decision was made in accordance with our practice occasionally to make an exemption to our interpretation of the embargo by approving exports of non-lethal military goods where it is clear that the embargo was not intended to prevent those exports. The Government believe that this export is justifiable on humanitarian grounds.</p>

	Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting: Malta
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-29b.5.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="5"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51129-31.htm#51129-31_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.5.3/1">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/2">The biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) took place in Valletta, Malta, from 25 to <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/3">Her Majesty the Queen attended the meeting in her role as Head of the Commonwealth. She also paid a state visit to Malta where she was most warmly welcomed by the Maltese people. The outgoing Commonwealth Chairman-in-Office, President Obasanjo of Nigeria, paid tribute on behalf of all Commonwealth members to the Queen's commitment and dedication to the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/4">This year, for the first time, Commonwealth Foreign Ministers met in advance of CHOGM to receive reports from Commonwealth bodies and to prepare the communiqu&eacute;. The UK was represented by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development and my noble friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Triesman).</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/5">Commonwealth Heads of Government last met in Abuja, Nigeria in December 2003. At Valletta, heads reviewed developments since then.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/6">As in 2003, heads issued a separate statement on multilateral trade. This highlighted the contribution that international trade makes to global prosperity, poverty elimination and sustainable development. They reaffirmed their commitments to the objectives of the Doha Development Agenda of the World Trade Organisation and to its conclusion by the end of 2006. While they welcomed the progress achieved since 2003 they stressed their deep concern about the pace of negotiations. The Commonwealth pledged its global influence to correct this and heads committed to inject urgency into their negotiators at the WTO, encouraging them to be flexible and place priority on a genuinely development-oriented outcome for the round.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/7">The importance of agriculture to developing economies was highlighted, with a call for the end of export subsidies by 2010 and time-bound commitments for substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support and significant improvements in market access.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/8">The importance of differential treatment for developing countries was highlighted in this context. Heads of Government also called for phased adjustment and other transitional measures to help vulnerable states, including small states and those traditionally dependent on preferential market access arrangements to meet the trade and development challenges facing them. This was noted with particular reference to the impact on some Commonwealth members as a result of the liberalisation of the EU sugar regime. The G8 initiative on &quot;Aid for Trade&quot; was applauded as a means for meaningful market access.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/9">Heads discussed other development issues, including the millennium development goals, where there is mixed progress in the Commonwealth. Heads welcomed the G8 proposals for debt cancellation and commitments by many developed countries to achieve the 0.7 per cent target. Heads confirmed their commitment to root out corruption. There was particular concern for vulnerable small states, which need help to diversify their economies. Some small states have been very badly affected by natural disasters. Heads endorsed a proposal from Bangladesh for the Commonwealth to develop proposals to address how it can help with disaster risk-reduction and responses.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/10">Heads also discussed terrorism, incitement and tolerance and reaffirmed their condemnation of all acts of terrorism. They emphasised that targeting and deliberate killing of civilians through acts of terrorism cannot be justified or legitimised by any cause or grievance. They commended the various initiatives to promote dialogue, tolerance and understanding among civilisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/11">Heads discussed how to use information and communications technologies to support development, reduce poverty and contribute to the attainment of the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/12">During the summit, I met the leaders of sugar-producing Caribbean states and a number of other leaders, including the Prime Ministers of Malta, Mauritius, Pakistan and Singapore.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/13">The Commonwealth expressed its concern about recent developments in Uganda, including the detention of Kizza Besigye. As Secretary-General McKinnon said on <phrase class="date" code="">Sunday 27 November</phrase>, Uganda knows what must happen between now and 2007 when it expects to host the next CHOGM. I also raised our concerns directly with President Museveni.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/14">It was agreed that the United Kingdom should return to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), the body charged with monitoring Commonwealth nations' compliance with the Harare principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/15">I participated in the Commonwealth sports breakfast and thanked Commonwealth leaders for supporting London's Olympic bid. Heads of Government looked forward to the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006 and I presented Glasgow's interest in hosting the Games in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.3/16">Copies of the concluding communiqu&eacute;, the separate statements on trade and small states and the declaration on networking for development have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	EU Telecoms Council
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-11-29b.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="7"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51129-31.htm#51129-32_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.7.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" name="Alun Michael">My right honourable friend the Minister for Industry and the Regions (Alun Michael)</phrase> has made the following the Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/2">I will be chairing the Telecoms Council of the UK's EU presidency in Brussels in the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/3">The first item on the agenda will look at the important theme of better regulation, focusing specifically on the 2006 review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications markets and on the future of EU spectrum policy. I will chair a policy debate on these issues and we have produced a presidency policy paper to help guide the debate. This discussion is important in the wider context of EU economic reform. I hope to achieve a steer from the council on the key issues that need to be addressed within the 2006 review and on the role of market based mechanisms in EU spectrum management.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/4">I will then introduce a policy debate on the i2010 Strategy which I believe can play a key role in achieving the Lisbon goals of economic growth and productivity. With the help of a presidency paper, I will ask my colleagues to explore the key issues that need to be the focus of attention in the area of information and communication technologies over the next five years and to discuss how best to ensure that ICT policy is appropriately reflected in wider national economic discussions both at EU and national level. I also hope that as part of this agenda item, we will be able to agree the set of council conclusions responding to the Commission communications on the i2010 Strategy and on e-accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/5">The third agenda item will look at the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting, focusing specifically on the spectrum gains from digital switchover and on a timetable for digital switchover in the EU. I hope that we will be able to agree the council conclusions responding to the Commission communication on this issue, but I do not anticipate a substantive policy debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/6">Finally, together with Viviane Reding, European Commissioner for Information Society and Media, I will report back on the outcome of the World Summit on Information Society which took place between 14 and <phrase class="date" code="">18 November</phrase> and parts of which I attended.</p>
