	<p pid="a.47.1/1">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Jack Straw) and Sir John Grant (UK Permanent Representative to the EU) represented the UK at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-27">27 February 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/2">The agenda items were covered as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.47.1/4">The presidency presented an annotated draft agenda for the 23-<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase> European Council meeting to be held in Brussels.

The presidency hopes the European Council will identify a series of priority actions to be implemented by the end of 2007 to fulfil these commitments. These priority actions should form a good basis on which to implement the second cycle of the Lisbon strategy in spring 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/5">In a short discussion, Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy Commissioner Wallstrom welcomed the annotated draft agenda particularly the focus on economic and energy issues.

The possibility of exemptions might also apply in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/17">The presidency took note of the concerns expressed. These will be taken into account in future negotiations with a view to the Justice and Home Affairs Council taking a decision on 27-<phrase class="date" code="">28 April</phrase>.</p>

CFSP High Representative Solana and External Relations Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner also briefed the council on their recent meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki which included discussion of the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue. The presidency agreed that Ministers should discuss Iran again following the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase> International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors meeting.</p>
