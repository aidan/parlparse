	<p pid="b.125.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/2">The Harrier GR9 and the Tornado GR4 are both currently providing invaluable support to our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have signed two contracts on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-21">21 December 2007</phrase>, appointing BAES as the prime contractor, which will deliver further significant capability upgrades to both the Harrier GR9 and the Tornado GR4. Under the programmes, both aircraft will receive improved secure communications, tactical data links and the Paveway IV precision guided bomb will be integrated on to Tornado. These upgrades will enhance the ability of these aircraft to support future operations by improving survivability, increasing situational awareness and lowering the risk of fratricide and collateral damage. The combined value of the programmes, through life, is &pound;548 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/3">The Ministry of Defence and BAES are committed to working together on these programmes to provide outstanding military capability that will deliver real benefits to operational capability.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Iain Wright) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.3/2">The Government are today announcing the allocation of an additional &pound;11.5 million to the disabled facilities grant programme for 2007-08. The programme has proved to be highly successful with funding to local authorities more than doubling from &pound;57 million in 1997 to &pound;138 million now. These additional funds for the current year will help assist local authorities in meeting existing demand for the provision of adaptations. A table detailing the additional funds provided to individual authorities has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.3/3">Local authorities must provide some of the finance for disabled facilities grant from their own resources, which brings total public sector spending on this programme to in excess of &pound;200 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.3/4">The disabled facilities grant programme helps approximately 35,000 disabled and older people each year to live as comfortably and independently as possible in their homes through the provision of adaptations. The disabled facilities grant programme provides mandatory grants for housing adaptations available to both disabled and older people, including improving access to a home and to the basic facilities within a home such as the provision of ramps, door widening and stair-lifts.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.3/5">I will be making a further statement on the future funding of disabled facilities grant and announcing a package of changes to improve delivery of the programme shortly as part of the cross departmental review of disabled facilities grant.</p>
