	<p pid="b.27.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.3/2">I am publishing today the Government's response to the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee's report of <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase> on reform of the coroners' system and death certification. Copies have been placed in the Libraries. It will also be made available on the Department for Constitutional Affairs website.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.3/3">The draft Coroners Bill was published on <phrase class="date" code="">12 June</phrase>. In the Bill we aim to do three things. First, we will improve the way that the system serves the public interest and meets bereaved families' concerns. The Bill will give families involved in the inquest process a clear legal standing in the system. We will also give families new rights through a new complaints and appeals system, enabling them to challenge a coroner's decision, and the introduction of a charter for bereaved people, which lays out the level of service that families can expect. Secondly, we will strengthen coroners' work. The Bill will establish a proper appointments system for coroners, who will have to be legally qualified and will have to work full time as coroners, instead of having another job and working part time as coroners. Thirdly, we will create a national structure for coroners' work. For the first time there will be a Chief Coroner, who will provide national leadership for coroners, as the Lord Chief Justice does for judges. This will be supported by national standards, a coronial advisory council, a proper inspection system and national training for coroners and their officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.3/4">I thank the committee for its thorough inquiry into our proposals to reform the coroners system, as set out in the draft Coroners Bill, and for the additional consideration it gave to death certification. The Government regard pre-legislative scrutiny as a vital step in the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.3/5">Our public consultation exercise on the Bill has almost concluded. We are considering very carefully the views put forward about our proposals before finalising the Bill for parliamentary introduction as soon as time allows.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.0/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Health Services (Rosie Winterton) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>, in a Written Answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the honourable Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> <I>Official Report</I>, col. 1331W, I stated that 187,086 tattoos were removed by the NHS between April 2004 and March 2005. I regret that this figure was incorrect.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/3">A variety of procedures are used to remove tattoos, which are also used in the treatment of other skin conditions. NHS information systems do not record sufficient detail to allow distinction between procedures to remove tattoos and procedures to treat other skin conditions. The Answer was based on a mistaken attempt to estimate the number of tattoos from the information on the wider grouping of skin procedures. That attempt was intended to be helpful, but ended up being misleading, first, because it is not possible from the existing data sets to say with any precision how many tattoos are removed by the NHS each year and, secondly, because clinical advice is that it is likely to be a far smaller number than the figure given.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/4">I have received a formal apology from the Information Centre, which accepts full responsibility for providing an incorrect response to the parliamentary Question.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/5">The Information Centre and the Department of Health place the highest importance on the integrity of information, and I have been assured by the chief executive of the Information Centre and the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health that appropriate steps are being taken to ensure that a similar situation does not recur. I apologise to the House for the error.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.2/1">My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/2">In line with measures I announced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase> regarding the strengthening of counter-terrorist financing frameworks, the Government will be seeking the agreement of the Privy Council on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase> for the adoption of two Orders in Council concerned with giving effect to UN financial sanctions regimes against Al-Qaida and the Taliban, and North Korea. The Government strongly support international efforts to tackle abuse of financial systems and these new orders will further enhance the UK's ability to play its full part in these international actions.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/3"><I>Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006</I></p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/4">UN financial sanctions against persons associated with Al-Qaida and the Taliban are currently given effect in the UK through the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2002. The new order will update these earlier provisions, bringing them into line with the new Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 that came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-12">12 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/5">The Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 will further strengthen our powers to freeze assets, including the property of persons listed at the United Nations under the relevant UN Security Council resolutions or who we suspect are persons acting on their behalf, and to prevent funds or economic resources being made available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/6"><I>North Korea (United Nations Measures) Order 2006</I></p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/7">Following North Korea's announced nuclear test, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-14">14 October 2006</phrase> to adopt resolution 1718 (2006), which calls upon all member states to impose sanctions against North Korea's nuclear, ballistic missile and other weapons of mass destruction-related programmes. The North Korea (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 will give effect to the financial sanctions measures set out in Resolution 1718.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.2/8">Consistent with the UN Security Council resolutions and with other financial sanctions legislation, both Orders in Council include provisions to allow the Treasury to licence exemptions to the restrictions to meet legitimate humanitarian needs.</p>
