	European Community: Specification of WIPO Treaties
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-10-13a.31.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="31"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51013-23.htm#51013-23_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.31.1/1">Two World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) treaties in the fields of copyright and performances are to be specified as European Community treaties in a statutory instrument being laid before Parliament. The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) are key international agreements dealing with rights for the creative industries. The specification of these treaties will require positive resolutions in both Houses and will pave the way in due course for European Community ratification of these important international agreements and help secure rights for United Kingdom creators overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/2">Most of the requirements of these treaties were already in place in United Kingdom law. Most of the remaining requirements were introduced with the implementation in the United Kingdom of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. This directive was implemented by the Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 2003 (SI 2003 No. 2498). The specification of the two WIPO treaties would allow the introduction of the only remaining requirement of these treaties, moral rights for performers, by means of a further statutory instrument, which would be subject to negative resolution procedure. A draft of such a further statutory instrument accompanies the explanatory memorandum for the current statutory instrument. A public consultation exercise seeking views on how obligations on performers' moral rights should be implemented was conducted in 2005. Summary copies of the responses to the consultation exercise have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
