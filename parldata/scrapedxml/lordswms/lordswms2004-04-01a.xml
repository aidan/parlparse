	Cyprus
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-04-01a.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100624" speakername="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" colon=":" colnum="67"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040401/text/40401-28.htm#40401-28_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.67.1/1">I would like to inform the House of developments in relation to Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">Following the breakdown of settlement negotiations in The Hague in March 2003, the UN Secretary-General made a report to the Security Council. In this report Kofi Annan announced that his proposal for a comprehensive Cyprus settlement (the Annan plan) remained on the table. However, he added that he did not propose to take any further initiatives unless and until he was given solid reason to believe that the necessary political will existed for a successful outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/3">The Secretary-General went on to say that he believed it would be a great step backward if the plan were simply to wither away. He believed that a solution on the basis of the plan could be achieved only if there was an unequivocally stated preparedness on the part of the leaders of both sides, fully and determinedly backed at the highest level in both motherlands, to commit themselves: (a) to finalise the plan (without reopening its basic principles or essential trade-offs) by a specific date with United Nations assistance; and (b) to put it to separate simultaneous referendums as provided for in the plan on a date certain soon thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">The United Kingdom shared this approach and continued to work with its EU and US partners in support of UN efforts to keep the plan on the table and to encourage the parties to demonstrate the necessary political will to re-engage.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/5">The elections in north Cyprus on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-14">14 December 2003</phrase> marked a turning point. The Turkish Cypriots voiced their resounding support for the pro-settlement, pro-EU parties and in doing so gave popular expression to a growing desire from the Turkish Cypriot community to work for an early settlement of the Cyprus problem in order to allow a reunited Cyprus to join the EU on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. Encouraged by the attitude of the Turkish Cypriots and aware of the potential positive impact a Cyprus settlement would have on its own EU aspirations, the AKP government in Ankara led by Prime Minister Erdogan signalled its own willingness to re-engage and work constructively for a settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/6">The parties (the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Greece and Turkey) were therefore invited to New York by the Secretary-General on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-04">4 February 2004</phrase> in order to resume negotiations towards a settlement on the basis of the Annan plan. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase>, following an initial round of discussions, the Secretary-General announced that the parties had agreed to resume talks on the basis of the Annan plan and had committed themselves to a three-phase process leading to a finalised plan being submitted to simultaneous, separate referendums on <phrase class="date" code="">24 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/7">The <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase> agreement was a landmark achievement. The parties had committed themselves to a strict timetable and a negotiation process which led inexorably towards simultaneous referendums on a pre-determined date on the basis of a settlement plan which, absent agreement between the parties (including, in the final stage, Greece and Turkey) would be finalised by the Secretary-General himself.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/8">Negotiations between the two sides resumed in Cyprus on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-19">19 February</phrase>. In parallel to the main political level negotiations between the leaders of the two communities, technical committees started to work through the whole range of laws and administrative texts and practical arrangements necessary to give effect to the new state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/9">During this phase of the negotiations, our High Commissioner in Nicosia informed the UN that the UK's earlier offer to the UN of giving up roughly half of the territory of the Sovereign Base areas in Cyprus remained valid, subject to some small changes in the map. The land to be ceded to the United Cyprus Republic would not in any way compromise the operational capabilities of the bases themselves. The UN confirmed that the UK's offer would be very valuable in taking forward the adjustments to the territory of the two new constituent states. The UK's offer has been incorporated in the UN's map for the new Cyprus.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>, the negotiations moved to Buergenstock, Switzerland, where the UN and the parties were joined by Greece and Turkey in a final push for a negotiated settlement agreed between the parties themselves. The UK attended in its capacity as a guarantor power in order to assist the efforts of the UN Secretary-General's good offices mission. The European Commissioner for Enlargement, Gunter Verheugen, also attended for the final days.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/11">On <phrase class="date" code="">29 March</phrase> the Secretary-General presented the parties with a revised plan. This revision was produced following extensive consultation and aimed to strike a balanced compromise, building on the earlier version of the Annan plan which had been presented to the parties in February 2003, and taking subsequent developments and both sides' views carefully into account. Following a further final round of meetings between the Secretary-General, the parties and Greece and Turkey, Kofi Annan called the parties together late on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase>. Announcing that the time for negotiation and consultation was over, and that the time for decision and action had arrived, the Secretary-General presented the parties and the guarantor powers (Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom) with his finalised plan&mdash;Annan IV&mdash;for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/12">In his remarks, Kofi Annan said that the plan was inevitably a compromise. It did not satisfy everyone's demands. But he believed that it met the core interests, and addressed the key concerns, of people on both sides. He added that the choice was not between the plan and some other mythical solution. In reality, the choice was between the settlement on offer or no settlement at all. The Government share this view.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/13">No one is under any illusion about what remains to be done. No one is saying that reunification will be easy. But the plan is balanced and fair, and offers all Cypriots the chance of a better future as citizens of a United Cyprus Republic within the European Union. The Government believe strongly that this is a chance which must not be squandered.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/14">The final decision will now be taken by the Cypriots themselves in separate, simultaneous referendums to be held on <phrase class="date" code="">24 April</phrase>.</p>

	Clinical Trials Directive
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2004-04-01a.69.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="69"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040401/text/40401-28.htm#40401-29_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.69.1/1">We are today laying before Parliament the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which will implement into United Kingdom law Directive 2001/20 of the European Parliament and of the Council of <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-04">4 April 2001</phrase> on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. The regulations will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, the date by which member states are required to implement the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">These regulations will ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of clinical trial subjects are protected by requiring sponsors of trials to be responsible for designing, conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials according to principles of good clinical practice derived from the principles set out in the amended 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, the regulations will further protect public health by ensuring that the results of clinical trials are collected, recorded and analysed in accordance with internationally recognised principles so that they can be audited and verified before being used to impact on public health, for example through a publication that changes medical prescribing practice or as evidence to support applications to place medicines on the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/3">The regulations will provide a statutory basis for:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/4">standardisation of procedures for ethical and competent authority consideration and authorisation;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/5">good clinical practice (GCP) standards for commencing and conducting clinical trials;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/6">good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards for medicines used in clinical trials; and</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/7">inspections against internationally accepted principles and standards of GCP and GMP, supported by enforcement powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/8">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Department of Health will be publishing guidance on the new procedures which the regulations will implement from <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. This will cover applications for clinical trial authorisations, inspections, ethics committee applications, informed consent for incapacitated adults and sponsorship of clinical trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/9">The Government have undertaken extensive consultation with stakeholders in both the pharmaceutical industry and the non-commercial clinical trials sector on how to implement the directive. Where possible, concerns expressed by the non-commercial sector, in particular, about the possible regulatory burden, have been taken into account in the UK regulations. Furthermore, the MHRA and Department of Health have been working with stakeholders to help them to comply with the practical requirements of the regulations. The Government believe that the regulations achieve a proper balance by safeguarding the rights of patients involved in clinical trials while avoiding a disproportionate impact on those who carry out clinical trials.</p>
