	Deepcut Review: One Year On

	<p pid="a.77.1/1">My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/2">I wish to clarify my Written Statement to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March 2007</phrase> (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 91-95WS) on the progress that has been made in the provision of care of our young recruits and trainees. I said that we have no plans to change our policy which allows all new recruits who have completed 28 days' service, regardless of their age, to discharge as of right (DAOR). But I was referring only to the management, care and welfare of service personnel under the age of 18. I should have said that we have no plans to change our policy which allows all new recruits under the age of 18 who have completed 28 days' service to DAOR within the first six months of service. Additionally, those under the age of 18 years 3 months who have passed their statutory period for DAOR, but who are clearly unhappy in their service, may be considered for discharge from the Armed Forces provided that their unhappiness has been registered with their commanding officer before reaching the age of 18.</p>
