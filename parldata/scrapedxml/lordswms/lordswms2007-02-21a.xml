	<p pid="a.88.1/55"><I>Advance from the Contingencies Fund</I></p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/56">The Department for Transport did not present a winter supplementary estimate in 2006-07. Consequently, its potential drawdown of cash is limited to the net cash requirement presented to Parliament in the main estimate (&pound;11,199,801,000). On latest forecasts, it is expected to reach that limit before the end of February 2007. As the Consolidated Fund Bill, enacting the spring supplementary estimate, is not due to be passed until mid-March, the department needs access to the Contingencies Fund to maintain spending on transport programmes. The amount it is seeking is not the full difference between the main estimate net cash requirement and the spring supplementary estimate net cash requirement, and it will be repaid in full once the Consolidated Fund Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/57">The department is obtaining the appropriate estimate cover to repay the advance during the spring supplementary estimates. Parliamentary approval for additional resources of &pound;533,764,000 will be sought in the spring supplementary estimate for the Department for Transport. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at &pound;300,000,000 will be met by repayable cash advances from the Contingencies Fund.</p>
