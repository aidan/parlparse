<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-07-03a.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="3"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60703-0136.htm#06070317000022">
	<p pid="a.3.1/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State, Ruth Kelly, has published the revised chapters 10 and 11 in relation to the above topics. This follows the examination in public into the draft chapters in October 2004, the panel report in December 2004, and the consultation on the first Secretary of State's proposed changes that closed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-11">11 November 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3">These chapters form an integral part of regional planning guidance (RPG) for the south-east and represent a revision to RPG9, as published in March 2001. Following commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 this will now form part of the statutory regional spatial strategy (RSS).</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">Chapter 10 takes sustainable waste management within a resource management approach as its underlying theme, starting with waste reduction. The aim is to drive waste up the hierarchy towards more recovery, re-use, recycling and composting and away from landfill. To achieve this, additional waste management capacity and new types of facilities will be required. The new policies set targets to achieve these through the development documents now being prepared under the reformed planning system, while ensuring that development does not harm the region's environment or the quality of life of its people.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/5">The maintenance of a healthy regional economy requires an adequate supply of minerals to support new housing building and deliver key infrastructure projects. Planning policy has to balance the essential requirements of the regional economy for minerals with the environmental impact arising from their extraction, processing and transport. The replacement regional minerals strategy, chapter 11, provides a set of policies and proposals to strike that balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/6">The consultation period for the proposed changes to the draft chapters ended on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-11">11 November 2005</phrase> with some 90 responses from individuals and organisations. Respondents were broadly supportive of the proposed changes. The final consultation has not resulted in any significant changes to the minerals policies or principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/7">There have been two significant changes in relation to waste as a result of the public consultation. The first involves new figures for waste to be managed as a result of updated and more accurate research. The amendments to the figures and policies W5, W6 and W13 for the region are minimal, but the amendments to table 4 in policy W7, where figures are given for each sub-region, are, in some of the sub-regions, more significant. Secondly, there have been amendments to policy W17 and its supporting text to clarify the policy on the subject of development in the green belt. These changes are required for consistency with PPG2: Green Belts.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/8">These chapters are integral and clearly identifiable parts of RPG9. It will be reviewed through the development of the spatial strategy for the south-east, the <I>South East Plan</I>, the draft of which was submitted to the first Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/9">Copies of the relevant documents are available in the Libraries of the House and electronically at <a href="http://www.gose.gov.uk/gose/planning/regionalPlanning/">www.gose.gov.uk/gose/planning/regionalPlanning/</a>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-07-03a.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="5"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60703-0136.htm#06070317000037">
	<p pid="a.5.1/1">My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls) has made the following Written Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/2">Robust counter-terrorist finance measures help to save lives and hold terrorists to account for their actions, and the Government constantly review the operation of their financial sanctions against terrorist suspects.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/3">In accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, countries are required to freeze the assets of individuals who are involved with terrorism and stop them receiving payments. For example, UNSCR 1390 (2002) calls upon states to:</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of these [listed] individuals, groups, undertakings and entities, including funds derived from property owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by them or by persons acting on their behalf or at their direction, and ensure that neither these nor any other funds, financial assets or economic resources are made available, directly or indirectly, for such persons' benefit&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/5">This is implemented in the UK through ECregulation 881 (2002) and the Al-Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/6">To ensure that these sanctions do not contravene basic human rights, UN Security Council Resolution 1452 states that payments that are,</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/7" class="indent">&quot;necessary for basic expenses including payments for foodstuffs, rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums and public utility charges&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/8">should be paid under a licence approved by a competent authority. Licences are considered and approved by HM Treasury under the relevant EC regulation and order.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/9">In the UK, it is a requirement that when an individual is listed for involvement in terrorism, including an association with al-Qaeda, state benefits paid direct to them are immediately suspended. Payments are approved under licence by the Treasury generally only where benefits are necessary to meet basic needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/10">The Government have decided that, given the fact that household income is generally pooled, state benefits paid to individuals sharing the same household with a listed person would be, directly or indirectly, for the listed person's benefit and should therefore be subject to appropriate restrictions and conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/11">The following procedures will apply to all state benefits paid to a household which includes a listed person, or to which a listed person is attached:</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/12">state benefit payments will be suspended pending the granting of a licence by the Treasury; andlicences will be issued by the Treasury in accordance with our legal obligations. Where licensed payments are approved, the Treasury will apply appropriate detailed safeguards to ensure that surplus funds are not made available to the listed person. This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis on the basis of risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/13">This procedure is currently being applied in respect of the households of five listed individuals. In each of these cases, the Government have suspended payments of child benefit and in two of these cases also tax credits pending the granting of licences. In four cases, because of the absence of other income, the Government are paying interim support to the households concerned. Once licences are obtained, these interim payments will stop and payments will restart under the appropriate licence conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/14">In four of these cases, applications for the approval of licences are being considered by the United Nations Sanctions Committee. Subject to UN approval, the Treasury will issue licences for the payment of relevant benefits and tax credits to the households concerned. In the fifth case, an application has been submitted to the UN today.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/15">Strict licence conditions will apply to payments in each of these cases. As part of these conditions and on the basis of a risk assessment, in three of these cases the Treasury will require the appointment of a third party, who will control the onward disbursement and use of benefit funds to protect against the risk that these funds are diverted to terrorism and ensure that all licensing conditions are enforced and monitored.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/16">It is the Government's intention that, following UN approval, licences will be granted as soon as possible subject to the appropriate licence conditions to guard against funds being diverted.</p>
