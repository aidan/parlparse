	<p pid="a.97.1/1">In recognition of the increasing importance of the FCO network in delivering our climate change goals, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Margaret Beckett) has looked again at our strategic international priorities, set out in the Government White Paper <i>Active Diplomacy for a Changing World: the UK's International Priorities</i>, published in March. Climate change was covered in the White Paper and implicit in strategic priorities five and six. We believe that we need to emphasise its central importance to our international agenda by creating a new strategic priority. This will be:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Achieving climate security by promoting a faster transition to a sustainable, low carbon global economy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/3">This wording is designed to draw attention to the outcome that the effort on climate change needs to achieve, and to underline the reality, which is not yet fully reflected in the priorities of foreign ministries worldwide, that climate change has become a core foreign policy challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/4">The Foreign Secretary is also announcing today the appointment of John Ashton as my special representative for climate change. His primary focus will be to build a stronger political foundation for international action on climate change, working to build consensus among key governmental and non-governmental actors in priority countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/5">Defra will continue to lead our international work on climate change. But the new strategic priority and John Ashton's appointment will strengthen significantly the contribution the FCO can make.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/2">In a Written Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January 2006</phrase>, I informed the House that the UK, along with all other donors, had decided to withhold direct budget support to the Government of Ethiopia as a result of concerns about the governance and human rights situation following the elections in June last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/3">I assured the House at that time that the UK remained committed to reducing poverty in Ethiopia and that we were looking at alternative ways to support poor people. I can now inform the House that I have approved &pound;94 million for a new protection of basic services grant. Its objective is to maintain and expand basic services, such as primary schooling, basic health care, water supply and sanitation, and agricultural extension, in order to continue Ethiopia's slow but steady progress towards meeting the millennium development goals while promoting transparency and accountability in the delivery of these services. It is also being supported by the World Bank, whose board has just approved funding of $215 million (&pound;123 million).</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/4">The project will provide for regular financial monitoring and reporting to ensure that funds are being allocated fairly and are being used for the agreed purposes. For the first time detailed budgetary information will be provided to citizens to increase local accountability. I hope that civil society organisations will play an important role in helping citizens to understand how money in the budget is allocated and what it is used for, and in bringing those responsible to account for spending decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/5">I have also recently approved &pound;30 million for the productive safety nets programme for the current year to provide assistance to 7 million chronically food-insecure households&mdash;the poorest people in the country. This programme removes the need for the annual emergency food appeal by providing poor people with predictable and guaranteed cash and food in exchange for work on public projects such as local roads and water schemes. During my visit to Ethiopia earlier this year, I was able to see for myself the way in which this programme was providing vital assistance to poor people to enable them to build better lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/6">Improving the governance and human rights situation in Ethiopia has to be a priority for the UK. My colleagues and I continue to raise with the Government of Ethiopia the need to improve governance and human rights in the country, in the light of the criminal trial of some leading opposition, media and civil society leaders on serious charges. We have urged the Ethiopian Government to ensure that the trials are fair, transparent and speedy, and are supporting the observation of the trial by an international jurist.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2006-06-08a.100.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="100"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60608-29.htm#60608-29_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.100.1/1">The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June</phrase> in Luxembourg. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (Margaret Beckett) and the Minister for Europe (Geoff Hoon) will represent the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/2">The agenda items are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/3">General Affairs</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/4" class="italic">Preparation of the European Council on 15 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June</phrase>: Draft Conclusions</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/5">We expect discussion of draft conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/6">European Council declarations are also expected on the Middle East peace process, Iraq, Lebanon, Africa, the western Balkans and Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/7" class="italic">Enlargement (possible agenda item)</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/8">Ministers may be asked to consider the texts on the opening of first chapter negotiations (science and research) for both Turkey and Croatia as well as the text for the EU/Turkey Association Council. The UK is keen to see language which reflects the EU's support for the UN Cyprus settlement process. The item may be taken off the agenda if agreement is reached at official level.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/9" class="italic">Migration</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/10">Spanish Foreign Minister Moratinos is expected to address the council on Spain's work to address illegal migration from west Africa. The Spanish are co-organising a regional conference with the French on migration and development in Rabat on 10 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July</phrase> to help to manage migration flows from west Africa to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/11">The UN high-level dialogue on international migration and development is also scheduled to take place in September. The UK looks forward to using this as a forum to showcase the EU's progressive record in this area and as an opportunity to identify ways to maximise the development benefits of voluntary legal migration and to minimise the risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/12" class="italic">European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (possible agenda item)</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/13">The council will discuss the Fundamental Rights Agency, with a view to reaching final agreement on the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/14">External Relations</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/15" class="italic">Preparation of EU/US Summit </p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/16">Preparations for the <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-21">21 June</phrase> EU/US summit are ongoing, with the presidency and Commission engaging the US on the draft declaration between now and the summit. The presidency is likely to present a progress note at the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/17" class="italic">Relations with the Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/18">We expect discussion at the council to focus on Montenegro, relations with Serbia and possibly the transition arrangements for the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia. Draft conclusions are expected on the comprehensive review for Bosnia-Herzegovina, regional co-operation and the signature of Albania's stabilisation and association agreement, which is expected to take place in the margins of the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/19" class="italic">Cuba</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/20">We expect council conclusions on Cuba, reaffirming the common position, extending the suspension of the 2003 diplomatic measures and calling for greater practical support for civil society.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/21" class="italic">Iraq</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/22">We anticipate a short discussion of Iraq over lunch. This is likely to cover developments on the ground and ways in which the EU can continue to support the new Iraqi Government. We expect Ministers to discuss and welcome the new Commission communication on EU/Iraq engagement, which is due to be issued on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June</phrase>. The council is also expected to consider a draft European Council declaration.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/23" class="italic">Iran </p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/24">High Representative Solana and the E3 will brief on the E3+3 Foreign Ministers' meeting in Vienna on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June</phrase>, and HR Solana's subsequent visit to Tehran.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/25" class="italic">Middle East Peace Process</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/26">The GAERC will consider the Middle East peace process declaration for the European Council. This is likely to welcome the development of the temporary international mechanism (TIM) to support Palestinian basic needs directly and both sides' commitment to negotiations. It is also likely to call on the new Palestinian Government to accept the three quartet principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/27" class="italic">World Trade Organisation</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/28">Commissioner Mandelson is expected to update the council on recent developments including the negotiations in Abu Dhabi on the EU/Gulf Co-operation Council free trade agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/29" class="italic">Sustainable Development</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/30">We expect the council to confirm political agreement of the revised EU Sustainable Development Strategy before forwarding the text to heads of state for adoption at the June European Council. The UK's aim has been to see a single coherent strategy that effectively communicates the Community's internal and external sustainable development objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/31" class="italic">AOB: International Facility for the Purchase of Medicine</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/32">French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy is expected to raise the French proposal for an international drugs purchase facility (IDPF) which aims to lower the cost of drugs for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and to improve the availability of these drugs. In line with the UK/France communiqu&eacute; at the Paris conference on innovative finance in February, we strongly support the IDPF and will work with France on the details as co-sponsor of the initiative, including the consultation process, to ensure the effectiveness of this proposal.</p>
