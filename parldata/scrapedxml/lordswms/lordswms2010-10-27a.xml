	Energy: Oil and Gas Licences

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2010-10-27a.103.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100912" speakername="Lord Marland" colon=":" colnum="103"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101027-wms0001.htm#10102746000003">
	<p pid="a.103.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change (Charles Hendry) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/2">After thorough consideration of the applications made in the 26th offshore oil and gas licensing round, I have decided to offer 144 production licences. This demonstrates the continuing attractiveness both of the United Kingdom continental shelf as an oil and gas producing province and of DECC's licensing system.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/3">My officials have carried out a screening assessment on the blocks for which applications were received.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/4">The screening exercise found that significant effects on protected nature conservation areas could not be excluded in relation to 99 blocks. Detailed environmental assessments will be required before a decision can be reached in relation to the licensing of these blocks. These assessments will examine the implications for the protected nature conservation areas of awarding oil and gas licences. Accordingly, I will not be offering licences for these blocks at this time.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.3/1">In light of the pressure on seating in the Chamber, particularly during Question Time, the Administration and Works Committee has agreed to make some of the seats Below Bar (which are currently for guests only) available to Members. With effect from <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-02">Tuesday 2 November</phrase>, the 15 seats on the Temporal side of the House will be reserved for Members who wish to sit but not speak. Members in these seats will be recorded as attending the sitting. On the Spiritual side, the front six of the 12 seats will be reserved for Members' spouses while the other six will be allocated to Members' guests. In addition, the 15 seats in the Lower West Gallery (above Black Rod's Box) will be made available exclusively for Members' guests, resulting in a net increase in guest seating. Outside Question Time, the Doorkeepers will have discretion to seat Members' guests Below Bar as space permits. These new arrangements will be reviewed in six months' time.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.5/1">My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Kenneth Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/2">I am today laying before Parliament the Government's Memorandum to the Justice Select Committee on post-legislative scrutiny of the Inquiries Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.5/3">The Inquiries Act 2005 introduced a comprehensive statutory framework for inquiries set up by Ministers to look into events that have caused or are capable of causing public concern. There are wide-ranging measures in the Act aimed at restoring public confidence in inquiries by making the inquiry process swifter, more efficient and less costly whilst meeting public need for thorough and far-reaching investigation.</p>

	Pensions: Automatic Enrolment

	<p pid="a.104.1/1">My honourable friend the Minister for Pensions (Steve Webb) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">Today, I am pleased to be able to publish the report of the independent review into making automatic enrolment work. The recommendations of the review team are a sensible and balanced package of proposals. In particular, the changes in scope and the deregulatory measures proposed will ensure the introduction of automatic enrolment is stable and proportionate. Therefore, I am pleased to announce that the Government will now proceed with implementation of the reforms on this basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">The main recommendations are:</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">the earning threshold for automatic enrolment should be aligned with the personal allowance for income tax and the threshold from which pension contributions become payable should be aligned with the national insurance primary threshold. Workers may opt in to saving and receive an employer contribution if they earn between these two thresholds;automatic enrolment should apply to all employers regardless of size, as previously proposed;there should be an optional waiting period of up to three months before a worker needs to be automatically enrolled. Workers may opt in during the waiting period;there should be a simple system for employers to certify that their money-purchase pension scheme meets the required contribution levels; andNEST is necessary to support successful implementation of automatic enrolment.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/5">A copy of the review team's report will be available on the department's website at: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/pensions-reform/latest-news">www.dwp.gov.uk/policy/pensions-reform/latest-news</a>, later today. Copies will also be available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office from 10.30 today.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/6">I am grateful to Mr Paul Johnson, Frontier Economics, who led the review team, and to Mr David Yeandle OBE, Engineering Employers' Federation and Mr Adrian Boulding, Legal and General Group PLC, who came together to make this review a success.</p>
