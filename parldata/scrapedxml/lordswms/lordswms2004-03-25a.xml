	<p pid="a.43.1/1">With the support of Her Majesty's Government the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-12">12 March</phrase> unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 1532 (2004). The resolution imposes an asset freeze against Charles Taylor, former President of Liberia, his wife Jewell Howard Taylor and his son Charles Taylor Jr. The asset freeze will also target senior officials of the former Taylor regime, and other close allies and associates of Taylor, as designated by the committee established by UN Security Council Resolution 1521 (2004). The legal basis for the asset freeze is that Charles Taylor and others continue to use misappropriated funds to undermine peace and stability in Liberia and the region. The resolution includes humanitarian and other exemptions to the freeze, and states the intention to consider whether and how to make frozen assets available to the Government of Liberia.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">With the support of Her Majesty's government, Common Position 2002/145/CFSP and EC Regulation 310/2002 imposing EU sanctions against Zimbabwe were renewed and replaced by Common Position 2004/161/CFSP and EC Regulation 314/2004 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-19">19 February 2004</phrase>. The measures include an arms embargo and ban on related technical assistance, with specific exemptions; an embargo on equipment that might be used for internal repression; a travel ban on listed Zimbabwean officials, who are undermining democracy, human rights and the rule of law, preventing them from entering the EU, with standard criteria for exemptions; and an assets freeze against the listed officials, with certain specific exemptions. The list of officials (in the annex to the common position) has been increased from 79 to 95. The measures in the new common position and regulation follow the EU Guidelines on Implementation and Evaluation of Restrictive Measures (Sanctions) in the Framework of the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy, which were adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December 2003</phrase>. The measures apply for 12 months from <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-21">21 February 2004</phrase>. Amendments or renewal of the measures will be made if their stated objective has not been met.</p>

	Gulf Veterans' Illnesses: Research into Reproductive Health
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-03-25a.44.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="44"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040325/text/40325-54.htm#40325-54_spmin3">
	<p pid="a.44.3/1">My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/2">A key principle of the Government's approach to addressing the health concerns of veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict is that there should be appropriate research into veterans' illnesses and factors that may have a bearing on these. Our current research programme is expected to cost at least &pound;8.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/3">As part of this research effort, the Ministry of Defence funded an independent study of the reproductive health of UK veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict through the Medical Research Council (MRC). The main findings of this research have today been published in a paper entitled &quot;Miscarriage, stillbirth and congenital malformation in the offspring of UK veterans of the first Gulf war&quot; in the International Journal of Epidemiology.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/4">The researchers have reported that for male veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict, they found no evidence for increased risk of stillbirth, chromosomal malformations or congenital syndromes. Some associations were reported between fathers' service and increased risk of miscarriage and other less well defined malformations. For female veterans, the number of stillbirths and malformations were too small to allow meaningful analysis and there was no effect on the risk of miscarriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.3/5">The MoD welcomes publication of this important research. The MRC's Military Health Research Advisory Group (MHRAG) has considered the paper. It agrees with the researchers that, overall, the lack of evidence to link reproductive health problems with Gulf service should be reassuring to veterans and that the apparent increased risk identified should be interpreted with caution. The MHRAG does not intend to recommend any additional research into this aspect of Gulf veterans' health at this time.</p>

	Iraq: Reconstruction
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/wms/2004-03-25a.45.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="45"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040325/text/40325-54.htm#40325-54_spmin4">
	<p pid="a.45.1/1">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2">I visited Iraq from 22 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>. In Baghdad I met the Iraqi Governing Council, Ministers and representatives of non-governmental organisations, as well as Ambassador Bremer and other staff from the Coalition Provisional Authority. In Basra I visited two development projects, met leaders of women's groups and held discussions with CPA South staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">Significant progress is being made. Iraq's economy is recovering with oil output now over 2.5 million barrels per day, and reconstruction projects are bringing results. I visited Al Faw to see the installation of five 2MW diesel generators, funded by DfID, which should provide the 45,000 citizens of Al Faw with 24 hours of electricity every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4">In Basra I visited the Rzero water treatment plant. This is part of a major programme to renew the Basra water supply. The USA is providing most of the capital investment, alongside some money provided by the Development Fund for Iraq, to extend new water mains to the poorest areas of Basra, and in doing so create up to 2,000 jobs. The DfID-financed team in CPA South helps to co-ordinate the whole programme. It should provide a good model for future collaboration.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/5">Successful reconstruction is bringing new challenges. Sustaining the improvements in infrastructure will require difficult political decisions by the new Iraqi Government about charging customers realistic rates for services such as electricity and water and strengthening the Iraqi institutions that run these utilities. The public distribution system for food and Iraq's state-owned enterprises will also need reform. The IMF and World Bank will have a significant role to play in this.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/6">Security remains a major concern for the Iraqis and those who are helping them. But encouraging progress is being made in recruiting for the new Iraqi security forces, and training programmes are under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/7">The transitional administrative law is a significant development in the political process. At the Iraqi Governing Council's invitation the UN has agreed to play a major role in facilitating the formation of the interim government and the preparation for elections. The handover on <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> will be a big step. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase> Iraqis will have to address their concerns to their own government. However, donors will still have a significant role, and we are working to make the transition as smooth as possible and to ensure that donors co-ordinate their programmes effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/8">The Minister for Municipalities and Public Works, Mrs Nasreen Berwari, joined me in Baghdad to launch DfID's interim country assistance plan for Iraq, which I announced to the House in a Written Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase> (col. 7WS). Copies of the plan are in the Libraries of both Houses. At the same time I was able to confirm that DfID is making an initial contribution of &pound;70 million to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq: &pound;40 million of this will be spent through the World Bank's trust fund and &pound;30 million through the UN's. We are also providing &pound;8.5 million to the International Finance Corporation for its programme for small and medium enterprises in Iraq, which will enable it to start promoting much needed business activity and employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/9">Recent events remind us to take nothing for granted in Iraq, but overall reconstruction is going better than many predicted. However, it will require a sustained effort from the Iraqis, with support from the international community, to ensure that it succeeds.</p>
