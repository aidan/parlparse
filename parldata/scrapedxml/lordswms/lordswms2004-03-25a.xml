	<p pid="a.43.1/1">With the support of Her Majesty's Government the United Nations Security Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-12">12 March</phrase> unanimously adopted UN Security Council Resolution 1532 (2004). The resolution imposes an asset freeze against Charles Taylor, former President of Liberia, his wife Jewell Howard Taylor and his son Charles Taylor Jr. The asset freeze will also target senior officials of the former Taylor regime, and other close allies and associates of Taylor, as designated by the committee established by UN Security Council Resolution 1521 (2004). The legal basis for the asset freeze is that Charles Taylor and others continue to use misappropriated funds to undermine peace and stability in Liberia and the region. The resolution includes humanitarian and other exemptions to the freeze, and states the intention to consider whether and how to make frozen assets available to the Government of Liberia.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">With the support of Her Majesty's government, Common Position 2002/145/CFSP and EC Regulation 310/2002 imposing EU sanctions against Zimbabwe were renewed and replaced by Common Position 2004/161/CFSP and EC Regulation 314/2004 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-19">19 February 2004</phrase>. The measures include an arms embargo and ban on related technical assistance, with specific exemptions; an embargo on equipment that might be used for internal repression; a travel ban on listed Zimbabwean officials, who are undermining democracy, human rights and the rule of law, preventing them from entering the EU, with standard criteria for exemptions; and an assets freeze against the listed officials, with certain specific exemptions. The list of officials (in the annex to the common position) has been increased from 79 to 95. The measures in the new common position and regulation follow the EU Guidelines on Implementation and Evaluation of Restrictive Measures (Sanctions) in the Framework of the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy, which were adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December 2003</phrase>. The measures apply for 12 months from <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-21">21 February 2004</phrase>. Amendments or renewal of the measures will be made if their stated objective has not been met.</p>
