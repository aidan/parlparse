	<p pid="a.25.3/1">My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/2">My right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister has published for public consultation proposed changes to the Ashford growth area section of Chapter 12 of regional planning guidance for the south-east (RPG9). They follow the public examination into the draft in December 2003 and the panel report in February 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/3">Growth areas are an integral part of regional planning guidance (RPG) and the draft chapter represents a revision to RPG9, as published in March 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/4">Other partial reviews of RPG9 are at various stages in the process. In particular, a public examination into the Milton Keynes and south Midlands sub-regional strategy is under way, and the Secretary of State's proposed changes for the regional transport strategy are out for consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/5">Ashford is both a centre for regional economic development and a gateway to Europe. Growth must bring real benefits to the whole community, which is why our proposed policies promote the right development in the right place at the right time.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/6">The regional planning guidance needs to define new policies which will not only support the projected growth of housing and jobs in Ashford but guide this growth in a sustainable way.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/7">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister proposes accepting all the recommendations of the independent panel that held the public examination into the proposed alterations, with minor modifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/8">I have written to the regional assembly with the proposed changes. There will now be a public consultation period on the proposed changes, which will end on <phrase class="date" code="">17 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.3/9">Copies of the relevant documents are available in the Libraries of the House and have been provided for all of the region's MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>
