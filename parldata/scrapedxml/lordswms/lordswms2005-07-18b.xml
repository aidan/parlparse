	Asian Tsunami
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-07-18b.55.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="55"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050718/text/50718-03.htm#50718-03_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.55.1/1">Following the Tsunami in the Indian Ocean on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-26">26 December 2004</phrase>, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) launched its largest ever operation to provide consular assistance to British nationals. The FCO provided an immediate and targeted response, with excellent commitment from staff but, given the sheer scale of the incident&mdash;triggered by the second largest earthquake on record&mdash;and the number of countries affected, FCO resources were stretched. In a relatively small number of cases, British nationals did not receive the level of service that we would normally have wished to provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/2">During February and March 2005, the FCO carried out an internal review of our consular response. The emerging findings of this review were published as part of the FCO's memorandum to the Foreign Affairs Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-09">9 March 2005</phrase>. The committee made copies of the memorandum available to all Members of Parliament. In the debate following the Foreign Secretary's Statement to the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase> concerning the tsunami, the Foreign Secretary undertook to make the final conclusions of the internal review known to the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/3">The conclusions of the internal review are set out in the form of a short summary of findings and a list of urgent and other recommendations copies of which the Foreign Secretary has today arranged to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/4">The recommendations are for both the Consular Directorate in London and for our posts overseas. The purpose of the internal review was to examine the FCO's overall response to the tsunami and identify those areas where better structures, equipment or preparation would have helped us to react more effectively. The review focused on the immediate response to the tsunami and dealt with the work of only the FCO and not of other government departments. The National Audit Office is currently examining the overall governmental response to the tsunami crisis, including the role of the FCO, in their review of consular services, due to be published by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.1/1">The British Council, although not a government department, receives a substantial grant-in-aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

It provides certain assurances or guarantees in respect of loss or damage while these works are on loan.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/2">In the six months ending on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-30">30 March 2005</phrase>, the British Council provided such assurances to eight national lenders and undertakings to 85 private lenders. The value of the contingent liabilities outstanding on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-30">30 March 2005</phrase> in respect of private lenders was &pound;18,830,698.

	Consular Fees Order 2005
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lordswms/2005-07-18b.57.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="57"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050718/text/50718-03.htm#50718-03_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.57.1/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has recently undertaken a review of the fees charged for visa and consular services overseas. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June 2005</phrase> Her Majesty in Council approved the Consular Fees Order 2005. This revokes and replaces the Consular Fees Order (No 2) 1999. The Government are today announcing new fees to be charged under this order with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/2">The order consolidates and re-categorises some of the fees that have previously been charged. It increases fees for notarial services, estate administration, attendances, matters undertaken relating to legal proceedings and repatriation and financial assistance. It raises fees for consular assistance in births, deaths, marriages and shipping, seamen and kindred matters. The order also increases fees for certain passports and visas and for certain searches undertaken by consular officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/3">Where consular fees have been raised then, in most cases, these fees have been increased by between 10 per cent and 20 per cent. Overseas passport fees are raised from &pound;56.50 to &pound;69 (standard passport for those 16 years or over), from &pound;36.50 to &pound;45 (standard passports for those under 16) and from &pound;67.70 to &pound;82 (48 page passport). The fee for amending an existing passport abroad will be increased from &pound;46.90 to &pound;57. The order also raises the fee for issuing emergency passports from &pound;35.50 to &pound;43.50 and temporary passport fees are increased from &pound;45.60 to &pound;55.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/4">Fees for multiple entry visas valid for between one and 10 years that ranged from between &pound;60 and &pound;150 have been consolidated in the order to one fee of &pound;85. The order increases the fees for transit visas from &pound;27 to &pound;30 and for six-month multiple entry visas from &pound;36 to &pound;50. The order also raises previously anomalous fees for returning residents, working holiday-makers, students, au pairs and those in employment or self-employed for under six months from &pound;36 to &pound;85. The fee for receiving an application for entry clearance (other than to the United Kingdom or the Crown Dependencies) is raised from &pound;22 to &pound;30.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/5">The order reduces the fees for a certificate of entitlement to right of abode from &pound;110 to &pound;85. Following the introduction of photo vignette visas the fee for a declaration of identity became obsolete and has been removed. This order also deletes provision for gratis visas to be issued to citizens of the former Soviet Union following the abrogation of a bilateral agreement with former Soviet Union states.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/6">In setting the new visa fees we have taken account of the views of those in the education sector, for whom the increase in the visa fee for students will be unwelcome. We recognise that international students bring significant economic and social benefits to the UK. UKvisas is committed to working closely with the education sector in the context of IND's new Joint Education Task Force to ensure that we have a genuine and informed dialogue with the education sector about immigration matters and develop better capacity to improve the evidence base on international students.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/7">But it is right that those who benefit from consular and visa services should meet the cost of them, rather than the UK taxpayer. The new fees represent the full economic cost of what we do, and will ensure that British missions overseas continue to provide a high standard of service to visa and consular customers. They will also enable further investment in improvements to service delivery and the effectiveness of immigration control, as set out in the five-year strategy for immigration and asylum, and in consular services, as set out in the 2004 consular strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/8">Copies of tables detailing the new fees have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.1/3" class="indent">scrutiny focused material will, as before, continue to be provided to the clerks of the two scrutiny committees as early as possible before Council of Ministers meetings;</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/4" class="indent">Written Ministerial Statements will be provided to Parliament no later than the day before a formal Council to provide as much information about the items on the agenda, why they are on the agenda, and what the UK as holder of the EU presidency hopes the Council will achieve.

	<p pid="b.59.1/5" class="indent">Written Ministerial Statements will be produced within five working days of each Council.

Only after the presidency will the Statements revert to setting out what the UK stance was in discussions. When reporting after an informal Council the Statement will be of a more general nature and will not highlight member states' positions, including the UK's.

	<p pid="b.60.3/1">When the King of Nepal dismissed the multi-party government and assumed direct power on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase> this year, the UK expressed grave concern, saying that these moves would increase the risk of instability in Nepal and undermine the institutions of democracy and constitutional monarchy in the country. We also said we would be assessing the impact of the move on our security and developmental assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.3/2">Three months on we remain concerned about the continued detention of a number of political and civil society activists and ongoing restrictions on the press. We acknowledge the King lifting the state of emergency and releasing a number of political leaders from detention. We welcome agreement to the establishment of an Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights office in Nepal. We also welcome the publication by the political parties of a joint position on <phrase class="date" code="">8 May</phrase>. We hope the King will respond to these efforts by engaging in a renewed dialogue with them. However, there is still a long way for the King to go in restoring representative government and democratic freedoms. This includes releasing the remaining political prisoners detained since <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase>, the easing of restrictions on the media and efforts to reintegrate the parties back into the political process. The Royal Nepalese Army also has a long way to go in improving its human rights record, tackling the culture of impunity and co-operating with human rights organisations. Our objective remains to see the restoration of basic civil and political freedoms. We will continue to co-operate with our key international partners in working towards this objective and will be monitoring the situation on the ground with close attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.3/3">My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said in a Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase> that we would review the impact of the King's actions. Against the background of recent developments, we are continuing to keep our security assistance to Nepal under review but now intend to provide a package of bomb disposal equipment, which we had previously planned to gift. The Ministry of Defence is today laying before the House a Parliamentary Minute which gives the details of the proposed package.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.3/1">The official launch of the United Kingdom Security Advisory Team (UKSAT) took place in Antigua on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-09">9 June 2005</phrase>, with addresses from the honourable Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, and John White, British high commissioner for the eastern Caribbean. Sir James Carlisle, Governor General of Antigua and Barbuda, and other senior representatives from the region were also present.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/2">The UKSAT project supports delivery of FCO's strategic priority two&mdash;protection of the UK from illegal immigration, drug trafficking and other international crime&mdash;and strategic priority eight&mdash;security and good governance of the UK's overseas territories. The FCO is providing &pound;1.5 million of funding for the project in 2005&ndash;06. The eastern Caribbean is a key transit point for cocaine from Latin America destined for the UK; through UKSAT, we are seeking further to develop our law enforcement co-operation and effectiveness in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/3">UKSAT will work in partnership with the regional security system (RSS) and the UK Caribbean overseas territories (COTs) to enhance law enforcement capacity in the RSS countries and the COTs. This will be achieved through training, advice and mentoring to strengthen actions against drug trafficking and other organised criminal groups operating in the Caribbean.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/4">The team will evolve over the next three years to consist of 14 personnel based in RSS countries: eight UK staff will include officers from H M Revenue and Customs and the Royal Navy and six recruited regionally. UKSAT will work closely with the RSS security screening programme to tackle corrupt practices and integrity issues in regional law enforcement organisations. In addition, UKSAT programmes will be delivered elsewhere in the region, notably Jamaica and Trinidad.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/5">As part of UKSAT, the Maritime Training Unit in Antigua will, in conjunction with the RSS training unit, continue to provide training and advice in support of maritime law enforcement activities in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.3/6">This practical training commitment reflects the close co-operation which exists at all levels between Her Majesty's Government and governments of the Caribbean nations and a shared commitment to tackle the problems of security and organised crime in the region, which affects both the Caribbean nations themselves and the UK. It is also of particular benefit to the COTs in helping them to meet their maritime law enforcement needs and in providing them with a sound basis to generate sustainable and effective operational capabilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.1/1">The most recent events in Zimbabwe are of grave concern. Zimbabweans are deprived of their democratic and human rights, facing the consequences of chronic economic misrule and grappling with severe food shortages.

We are also very concerned about the welfare of children. Infants have been forced to sleep outside in the middle of winter. There are also reports of children being detained in prison and separated from their parents. The crackdown continues to spread across the country to many urban and some rural areas. Armed police have swiftly crushed any resistance with teargas. This action has receivedwidespread international condemnation. The UN's Special Representative on the Right to Adequate Housing called this &quot;a new form of apartheid&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/3">In response, we have joined our EU partners in demanding that the government of Zimbabwe end this crackdown, in a statement on <phrase class="date" code="">7 June</phrase>. Our ambassador in Harare has raised our strong concerns, directly to the government of Zimbabwe, in meetings with the Vice-President and the Minister of State for National Security. I summoned the Zimbabwean charge d'affaires on <phrase class="date" code="">13 June</phrase> to protest at the continuing human rights abuses under the ongoing crackdown. We remain in close contact with our EU partners, with whom I raised Zimbabwe at the <phrase class="date" code="">13 June</phrase> General Affairs and External Relations Council. We also continue to work with other international partners to maximise the pressure on Zimbabwe to end this brutality and are discussing these and other human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, with neighbouring African states and regional African bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/4">DfID is already responding to this man-made disaster, providing $400,000 so far towards humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable mainly through the UN and International Organisation for Migration. A further contribution is imminent. To date, over 5,000 families have been reached with food, blankets, soap and other forms of assistance. Where appropriate transport and emergency water and sanitation has been provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/5">Since 2002 the European Union has imposed targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe; an arms embargo on the country and a travel ban and asset freeze on President Mugabe and leading regime figures. The EU's common position is kept under regular review. Together with our EU partners we have recently reassessed the situation in Zimbabwe following the March parliamentary elections. We agreed yesterday in the light of that assessment to extend the list of those regime figures caught by the travel ban and asset freeze, from 95 to 120 names. The new list includes all the senior members of the new government and politburo, and senior figures involved in manipulating the election.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/6">This decision emphasises the EU's continued concerns about the lack of democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law that exists in Zimbabwe, and the failure of Mugabe and his regime to respond to international calls for reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/7">Her Majesty's Government will continue to work with the European Union and our other international partners to restore democratic governance, human rights and the rule of law to Zimbabwe.</p>
