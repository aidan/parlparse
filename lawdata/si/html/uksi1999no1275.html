</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations further amend the National Health Service (Existing Liabilities Scheme) Regulations 1996 which established a Scheme whereby bodies providing NHS services may make provision for meeting liabilities incurred before 1st April 1995 to third parties in connection with personal injury arising out of negligence in the carrying out of their functions.<BR><BR>
In particular they provide for the Secretary of State to make payments to third parties on behalf of eligible bodies. They also make minor amendments relating to the matters the Secretary of State shall consider in determining payments under the Scheme and provide for additional circumstances where he may refuse to meet any liabilities. Provision is also made, by the insertion of a new regulation 6A, enabling the Secretary of State to make payments on account of any payment which may become payable by him under regulation 6.<BR><BR>
