&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) In this article "credit limit" in relation to a credit account authorised for use under paragraph (2) means the maximum amount (if any) which is to be due on the account at any time, as notified by the Registrar to the account holder from time to time, by such means of communication as the Registrar considers appropriate.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any person or firm may, if authorised by the Registrar, use a credit account in accordance with this article for the purpose of the payment of fees for applications and services of such kind as the Registrar shall from time to time direct.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purpose of enabling the Registrar to consider whether or not a person or firm seeking to use a credit account may be authorised to use such an account, that person or firm shall furnish to the Registrar such information and evidence as the Registrar may require to satisfy him of the person or firm's fitness to hold a credit account and the ability of the person or firm to pay any amounts which may become due from time to time under a credit account, if authorised.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) For the purpose of enabling the Registrar to consider from time to time whether or not an account holder may continue to be authorised to use a credit account, the account holder shall furnish to the Registrar from time to time, when requested to do so by the Registrar, such information and evidence as the Registrar may require to satisfy him of the account holder's continuing fitness to hold a credit account and the continuing ability of the account holder to pay any amounts which may become due from time to time under the account holder's credit account.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where an account holder makes an application in respect of which credit facilities are available, he may make a request, in such manner as the Registrar shall direct, for the appropriate fee to be debited to the account holder's credit account, but the Registrar shall not be required to accept such a request where the amount due on the account exceeds the credit limit applicable to the credit account, or would exceed it if the request were to be accepted.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where a person or firm having a credit account makes an application in respect of which credit facilities are available but which is not accompanied by any fee and does not contain a request for the fee to be debited to such account, the Registrar may debit the fee to that person's or that firm's credit account.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) A statement of account shall be sent by the Registrar to each account holder at the end of each calendar month or such other period as the Registrar shall direct either in any particular case or generally.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) On receipt of the statement the account holder shall pay by cheque any sum due on his credit account forthwith.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Cheques shall be crossed and made payable to H.M. Land Registry and sent to the Accounts Section, H.M. Land Registry, Burrington Way, Plymouth PL5 3LP or at such other address as the Registrar shall direct.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) The Registrar may at any time and without giving reasons terminate or suspend any or all authorisations given under paragraph (2).<BR><BR>
