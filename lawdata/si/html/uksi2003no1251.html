</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the Extradition (Torture) Order 1997 ("the 1997 Order") which made provision in respect of the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment ("the Convention") which is referred to in section 22(2)(g) of the Extradition Act 1989.<BR><BR>
The amendments made by articles 2 and 3(2) in respect of Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are included as Yugoslavia as a State has ceased to exist. The other changes made by article 2(2) are to remove from Schedule 2 to the 1997 Order those States with which general extradition arrangements have been made. Article 2(3) adds to that Schedule those States which have become parties to the Convention and in relation to which Orders in Council under section 2 of the Extradition Act 1870 are in force. The other changes made by article 3(2) are to remove from Part I of Schedule 3 to the 1997 Order those States with which general extradition arrangements have now been made. Article 3(3) amends that Part to add those States which have now become parties to the Convention.<BR><BR>
