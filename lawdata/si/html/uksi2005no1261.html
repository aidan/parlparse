<br/>
<center>
AGREEMENT ON THE TAXATION OF SAVINGS INCOME BETWEEN JERSEY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND</center>
<br/>
WHEREAS:<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
1.</b>
Article 17 of Directive 2003/48/EEC ("the Directive") of the Council of the European Union ("the Council") on taxation of savings income provides that before 1 January 2004 Member States shall adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive which provisions shall be applied from 1 January 2005 provided that&#8212;<br/><br/>
<ul><ul>
<ul>
" 
(i) The Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Monaco and the Principality of Andorra apply from that same date measures equivalent to those contained in this Directive, in accordance with agreements entered into by them with the European Community, following unanimous decisions of the Council;<br/><br/>
(ii) all agreements or other arrangements are in place, which provide that all the relevant dependent or associated territories apply from that same date automatic exchange of information in the same manner as is provided for in Chapter II of this Directive, (or, during the transitional period defined in Article 10, apply a withholding tax on the same terms as are contained in Articles 11 and 12)".<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
</ul><p>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
2.</b>
The relationship of Jersey with the EU is determined by Protocol 3 of the Treaty of Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Community. Under the terms of the Protocol Jersey is not within the EU fiscal territory.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
3.</b>
Jersey notes that, while it is the ultimate aim of the EU Member States to bring about effective taxation of interest payments in the beneficial owner's Member State of residence for tax purposes through the exchange of information concerning interest payments between themselves, three Member States, namely Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg, during a transitional period, shall not be required to exchange information but shall apply a withholding tax to the savings income covered by the Directive.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
4.</b>
The "withholding tax" referred to in the Directive will be referred to as the "retention tax" in Jersey's domestic legislation. For the purposes of this Agreement the two terms therefore are to be read coterminously as "withholding/retention tax" and shall have the same meaning.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
5.</b>
Jersey has agreed to apply a retention tax with effect from 1 January 2005 provided the Member States have adopted the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive, and the requirements of Article 17 of the Directive and Article 17(2) of this Agreement have generally been met.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
6.</b>
Jersey has agreed to apply automatic exchange of information in the same manner as is provided for in Chapter II of the Directive from the end of the transitional period as defined in Article 10(2) of the Directive.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
7.</b>
Jersey has legislation relating to undertakings for collective investment that is deemed to be equivalent in its effect to the EC legislation referred to in Articles 2 and 6 of the Directive.<br/><br/>
Jersey and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland hereinafter referred to as a "contracting party" or the "contracting parties" unless the context otherwise requires,<br/><br/>
Have agreed to conclude the following agreement which contains obligations on the part of the contracting parties only and provides for:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) the automatic exchange of information by the competent authority of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the competent authority of Jersey in the same manner as to the competent authority of a Member State;<br/><br/>
(b) the application by Jersey, during the transitional period defined in Article 10 of the Directive, of a retention tax from the same date and on the same terms as are contained in Articles 11 and 12 of that Directive;<br/><br/>
(c) the automatic exchange of information by the competent authority of Jersey to the competent authority of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in accordance with Article 13 of the Directive;<br/><br/>
(d) the transfer by the competent authority of Jersey to the competent authority of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of 75%  of the revenue of the retention tax;<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
in respect of interest payments made by a paying agent established in a contracting party to an individual resident in the other contracting party.<br/><br/>
For the purposes of this Agreement the term "competent authority" when applied to the contracting parties means "The Commissioners of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative" in respect of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and "the Comptroller of Income Tax" in respect of Jersey.<br/><br/>
<center>
<font size=-1>
Article 1</font>
</center>
<br/>
<center>
<b>Retention of Tax by Paying Agents</b></center>
<br/>
Interest payments as defined in Article 8 of this Agreement which are made by a paying agent established in Jersey to beneficial owners within the meaning of Article 5 of this Agreement who are residents of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall, subject to Article 3 of this Agreement, be subject to a retention from the amount of interest payment during the transitional period referred to in Article 14 of this Agreement starting at the date referred to in Article 15 of this Agreement. The rate of retention tax shall be 15%  during the first three years of the transitional period, 20%  for the subsequent three years and 35%  thereafter.<br/><br/>
<center>
<font size=-1>
Article 2</font>
</center>
<br/>
<center>
<b>Reporting of Information by Paying Agents</b></center>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Where interest payments, as defined in Article 8 of this Agreement, are made by a paying agent established in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to beneficial owners, as defined in Article 5 of this Agreement, who are residents of Jersey, or where the provisions of Article 3(1)(a) of this Agreement apply, the paying agent shall report to its competent authority:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) the identity and residence of the beneficial owner established in accordance with Article 6 of this Agreement;<br/><br/>
(b) the name and address of the paying agent;<br/><br/>
(c) the account number of the beneficial owner or, where there is none, identification of the debt claim giving rise to the interests;<br/><br/>
(d) information concerning the interest payment specified in Article 4(1) of this Agreement. However, each contracting party may restrict the minimum amount of information concerning interest payment to be reported by the paying agent to the total amount of interest or income and to the total amount of the proceeds from sale, redemption or refund;<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland will comply with paragraph 2 of this Article.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Within six months following the end of the tax year, the competent authority of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall communicate to the competent authority of Jersey, automatically, the information referred to in paragraph (1) (a)&#8211;(d) of this Article, for all interest payments made during that year.<br/><br/>
<center>
<font size=-1>
Article 3</font>
</center>
<br/>
<center>
<b>Exceptions to the Retention Tax Procedure</b></center>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Jersey when levying a retention tax in accordance with Article 1 of this Agreement shall provide for one or both of the following procedures in order to ensure that the beneficial owners may request that no tax be retained:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) a procedure which allows the beneficial owner as defined in Article 5 of this Agreement to avoid the retention tax specified in Article 1 of this Agreement by expressly authorising his paying agent to report the interest payments to the competent authority of the contracting party in which the paying agent is established. Such authorisation shall cover all interest payments made to the beneficial owner by that paying agent;<br/><br/>
(b) a procedure which ensures that retention tax shall not be levied where the beneficial owner presents to his paying agent a certificate drawn up in his name by the competent authority of the contracting party of residence for tax purposes in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) At the request of the beneficial owner, the competent authority of the contracting party of the country of residence for tax purposes shall issue a certificate indicating:<br/><br/>
<ul><ul>
(i) the name, address and tax or other identification number or, failing such, the date and place of birth of the beneficial owner;<br/><br/>
(ii) the name and address of the paying agent;<br/><br/>
(iii) the account number of the beneficial owner or, where there is none, the identification of the security.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
</ul><p>
<ul>
Such certificate shall be valid for a period not exceeding three years. It shall be issued to any beneficial owner who requests it, within two months following such request.</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where paragraph (1)(a) of this Article applies, the competent authority of Jersey in which the paying agent is established shall communicate the information referred to in Article 2(1) of this Agreement to the competent authority of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the country of residence of the beneficial owner. Such communications shall be automatic and shall take place at least once a year, within six months following the end of the tax year established by the laws of a contracting party, for all interest payments made during that year.<br/><br/>
<center>
<font size=-1>
Article 4</font>
</center>
<br/>
<center>
<b>Basis of assessment for retention tax</b></center>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A paying agent established in Jersey shall levy retention tax in accordance with Article 1 of this Agreement as follows:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) in the case of an interest payment within the meaning of Article 8(1)(a) of this Agreement: on the gross amount of interest paid or credited;<br/><br/>
(b) in the case of an interest payment within the meaning of Article 8(1)(b) or (d) of this Agreement: on the amount of interest or income referred to in (b) or (d) of that paragraph or by a levy of equivalent effect to be borne by the recipient on the full amount of the proceeds of the sale, redemption or refund;<br/><br/>
(c) in the case of an interest payment within the meaning of Article 8(1)(c) of this Agreement: on the amount of interest referred to in that sub-paragraph;<br/><br/>
(d) in the case of an interest payment within the meaning of Article 8(4) of this Agreement: on the amount of interest attributable to each of the members of the entity referred to in Article 7(2) of this Agreement who meet the conditions of Article 5(1) of this Agreement;<br/><br/>
(e) where Jersey exercises the option under Article 8(5) of this Agreement: on the amount of annualised interest.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph (1) of this Article, the retention tax shall be deducted on a pro rata basis to the period during which the beneficial owner held the debt-claim. If the paying agent is unable to determine the period of holding on the basis of the information made available to him, the paying agent shall treat the beneficial owner as having been in possession of the debt-claim for the entire period of its existence, unless the latter provides evidence of the date of the acquisition.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The imposition of retention tax by Jersey shall not preclude the other contracting party of residence for tax purposes of the beneficial owner from taxing income in accordance with its national law.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) During the transitional period, Jersey may provide that an economic operator paying interest to, or securing interest for, an entity referred to in Article 7(2) of this Agreement in the other contracting party shall be considered the paying agent in place of the entity and shall levy the retention tax on that interest, unless the entity has formally agreed to its name, address and the total amount of the interest paid to it or secured for it being communicated in accordance with the last paragraph of Article 7(2) of this Agreement.<br/><br/>
<center>
<font size=-1>
Article 5</font>
</center>
<br/>
<center>
<b>Definition of beneficial owner</b></center>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Agreement, "beneficial owner" shall mean any individual who receives an interest payment or any individual for whom an interest payment is secured, unless such individual can provide evidence that the interest payment was not received or secured for his own benefit. An individual is not deemed to be the beneficial owner when he:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) acts as a paying agent within the meaning of Article 7(1) of this Agreement;<br/><br/>
(b) acts on behalf of a legal person, an entity which is taxed on its profits under the general arrangements for business taxation, an UCITS authorised in accordance with Directive 85/611/EEC or an equivalent undertaking for collective investment established in Jersey, or an entity referred to in Article 7(2) of this Agreement and, in the last mentioned case, discloses the name and address of that entity to the economic operator making the interest payment and the latter communicates such information to the competent authority of its contracting party of establishment;<br/><br/>
(c) acts on behalf of another individual who is the beneficial owner and discloses to the paying agent the identity of that beneficial owner.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where a paying agent has information suggesting that the individual who receives an interest payment or for whom an interest payment is secured may not be the beneficial owner, and where neither paragraph (1)(a) nor (1)(b) of this Article applies, it shall take reasonable steps to establish the identity of the beneficial owner. If the paying agent is unable to identify the beneficial owner, it shall treat the individual in question as the beneficial owner.<br/><br/>
<center>
<font size=-1>
Article 6</font>
</center>
<br/>
<center>
<b>Identity and residence of beneficial owners</b></center>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Each Party shall, within its territory, adopt and ensure the application of the procedures necessary to allow the paying agent to identify the beneficial owners and their residence for the purposes of this Agreement. Such procedures shall comply with the minimum standards established in paragraphs (2) and (3).<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The paying agent shall establish the identity of the beneficial owner on the basis of minimum standards which vary according to when relations between the paying agent and the recipient of the interest are entered into, as follows:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) for contractual relations entered into before 1 January 2004, the paying agent shall establish the identity of the beneficial owner, consisting of his name and address, by using the information at its disposal, in particular pursuant to the regulations in force in its country of establishment and to Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June, 1991 in the case of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland or equivalent legislation in the case of Jersey on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering;<br/><br/>
(b) for contractual relations entered into, or transactions carried out in the absence of contractual relations, on or after 1 January, 2004 the paying agent shall establish the identity of the beneficial owner, consisting of the name, address and, if there is one, the tax identification number allocated by the Member State of residence for tax purposes. These details should be established on the basis of the passport or of the official identity card presented by the beneficial owner. If it does not appear on that passport or official identity card, the address shall be established on the basis of any other documentary proof of identity presented by the beneficial owner. If the tax identification number is not mentioned on the passport, on the official identity card or any other documentary proof of identity, including, possibly the certificate of residence for tax purposes, presented by the beneficial owner, the identity shall be supplemented by a reference to the latter's date and place of birth established on the basis of his passport or official identification card.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The paying agent shall establish the residence of the beneficial owner on the basis of minimum standards which vary according to when relations between the paying agent and the recipient of the interest are entered into. Subject to the conditions set out below, residence shall be considered to be situated in the country where the beneficial owner has his permanent address:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) for contractual relations entered into before 1 January, 2004 the paying agent shall establish the residence of the beneficial owner by using the information at its disposal, in particular pursuant to the regulations in force in its country of establishment and to Directive 91/308/EEC in the case of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland or equivalent legislation in the case of Jersey;<br/><br/>
(b) for contractual relations entered into, or transactions carried out in the absence of contractual relations, on or after 1 January, 2004, the paying agents shall establish the residence of the beneficial owner on the basis of the address mentioned on the passport, on the official identity card or, if necessary, on the basis of any documentary proof of identity presented by the beneficial owner and according to the following procedure: for individuals presenting a passport or official identity card issued by a Member State who declare themselves to be resident in a third country, residence shall be established by means of a tax residence certificate issued by the competent authority of the third country in which the individual claims to be resident. Failing the presentation of such a certificate, the Member State which issued the passport or other official identity document shall be considered to be the country of residence.<br/><br/>

Article 7</font>
</center>
<br/>
<center>
<b>Definition of paying agent</b></center>
<br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Agreement, "paying agent" means any economic operator who pays interest to or secures the payment of interest for the immediate benefit of the beneficial owner, whether the operator is the debtor of the debt claim which produces the interest or the operator charged by the debtor or the beneficial owner with paying interest or securing the payment of interest.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any entity established in a contracting party to which interest is paid or for which interest is secured for the benefit of the beneficial owner shall also be considered a paying agent upon such payment or securing of such payment. This provision shall not apply if the economic operator has reason to believe, on the basis of official evidence produced by that entity that:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) it is a legal person with the exception of those legal persons referred to in paragraph (5) of this Article; or<br/><br/>
(b) its profits are taxed under the general arrangements for business taxation; or<br/><br/>
(c) it is an UCITS recognised in accordance with Directive 85/611/EEC of the Council or an equivalent undertaking for collective investment established in Jersey.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
<ul>
An economic operator paying interest to, or securing interest for, such an entity established in the other contracting party which is considered a paying agent under this paragraph shall communicate the name and address of the entity and the total amount of interest paid to, or secured for, the entity to the competent authority of its contracting party of establishment, which shall pass this information on to the competent authority of the contracting party where the entity is established.</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The entity referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article shall, however, have the option of being treated for the purposes of this Agreement as an UCITS or equivalent undertaking as referred to in sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph (2) of this Article. The exercise of this option shall require a certificate to be issued by the contracting party in which the entity is established and presented to the economic operator by that entity. A contracting party shall lay down the detailed rules for this option for entities established in its territory.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where the economic operator and the entity referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article are established in the same contracting party, that contracting party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the entity complies with the provisions of this Agreement when it acts as a paying agent.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The legal persons exempted from sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph (2) of this Article are:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) in Finland: avoin yhtio (Ay) and kommandiittiyhtio (Ky)/oppet bolag and kommanditbolag;<br/><br/>
(b) in Sweden: handelsbolag (HB) and kommanditbolag (KB).<br/><br/>

Article 8</font>
</center>
<br/>
<center>
<b>Definition of interest payment</b></center>
<br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Agreement "interest payment" shall mean:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) interest paid, or credited to an account, relating to debt claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and, in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures; penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest payment;<br/><br/>
(b) interest accrued or capitalised at the sale, refund or redemption of the debt claims referred to in (a);<br/><br/>
(c) income deriving from interest payments either directly or through an entity referred to in Article 7(2) of this Agreement, distributed by:<br/><br/>
<ul>
(i) an UCITS authorised in accordance with EC Directive 85/611/EEC of the Council;<br/><br/>
(ii) an equivalent undertaking for collective investment established in Jersey;<br/><br/>
(iii) entities which qualify for the option under Article 7(3) of this Agreement;<br/><br/>
(iv) undertakings for collective investment established outside the territory to which the Treaty establishing the European Community applies by virtue of Article 299 thereof and outside Jersey.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
(d) income realised upon the sale, refund or redemption of shares or units in the following undertakings and entities, if they invest directly or indirectly, via other undertakings for collective investment or entities referred to below, more than 40%  of their assets in debt claims as referred to in (a):<br/><br/>
<ul>
(i) an UCITS authorised in accordance with Directive 85/611/EEC;<br/><br/>
(ii) an equivalent undertaking for collective investment established in Jersey;<br/><br/>
(iii) entities which qualify for the option under Article 7(3) of this Agreement;<br/><br/>
(iv) undertakings for collective investment established outside the territory to which the Treaty establishing the European Community applies by virtue of Article 299 thereof and outside Jersey.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
</ul><p>
<ul>
However, the contracting parties shall have the option of including income mentioned under paragraph (1)(d) of this Article in the definition of interest only to the extent that such income corresponds to gains directly or indirectly deriving from interest payments within the meaning of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) of this Article.</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As regards paragraphs (1)(c) and (d) of this Article, when a paying agent has no information concerning the proportion of the income which derives from interest payments, the total amount of the income shall be considered an interest payment.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) As regards paragraph (1)(d) of this Article, when a paying agent has no information concerning the percentage of the assets invested in debt claims or in shares or units as defined in that paragraph, that percentage shall be considered to be above 40% . Where he cannot determine the amount of income realised by the beneficial owner, the income shall be deemed to correspond to the proceeds of the sale, refund or redemption of the shares or units.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) When interest, as defined in paragraph (1) of this Article, is paid to or credited to an account held by an entity referred to in Article 7(2) of this Agreement, such entity not having qualified for the option under Article 7(3) of this Agreement, such interest shall be considered an interest payment by such entity.<br/><br/>

President, Policy and Resources Committee Done at St Helier on 19th November 2004<br/>
<br/><hr/><center><b>
<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</b><br/><br/><i>
(This note is not part of the Order)</i></center><br/><br/>
The Tax Information Exchange Agreement between the United Kingdom and Jersey is set out in the Schedule to this Order.<br/><br/>
Article 1 of the Order provides for its citation.<br/><br/>
Article 2 makes a declaration as to the effect and content of the arrangements set out in the Agreement contained in Part I of the Schedule to the Order, and that it is expedient that those arrangements should have effect.<br/><br/>
The Tax Information Exchange Agreement secures application in Jersey of the same measures as are contained in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments ("the Directive"). It is based on a model reflecting the provisions of the Directive, which was drawn up by Jersey, jointly with Guernsey and the Isle of Man for all Member States, discussed by those Member States and approved by the EU Council of Ministers.<br/><br/>
The Agreement constitutes a reciprocal arrangement between the United Kingdom and Jersey for the exchange of information on savings income in the form of interest payments made cross-border from one Party to individuals resident in the other Contracting Party.<br/><br/>
As the Agreement enshrines all the measures corresponding to the Directive, it provides not only for the exchange arrangements between competent authorities but also the details of the mechanisms to be followed by paying agents for the identification of individual owners, and for collecting the information to be exchanged.<br/><br/>
For an initial transitional period corresponding to the transitional period in the Directive, Jersey will levy a retention (withholding) tax on relevant payments, unless the individual owner opts for the interest to be reported. (This arrangement corresponds to the transitional provisions granted under the Directive to Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg.) Income generated by the retention tax will be shared with the United Kingdom, and relieved in the same manner as in withholding tax is to be relieved under the Directive.<br/><br/>
The United Kingdom will apply automatic exchange of information from the start of the Agreement. At the end of the transitional period, however, both parties will apply full automatic exchange of information in respect of the information covered by the Agreement.<br/><br/>
The detailed provisions of the Agreement are as follows&#8212;<br/><br/>
Articles 1-4 set out the details of the transitional retention tax and the categories of information to be exchanged automatically, both during the transitional period and thereafter.<br/><br/>
Articles 5-8 and Article 11 provide the definitions corresponding to those in the Directive of beneficial owner, paying agent and interest.<br/><br/>
Article 9 confirms that Jersey will share 75%  of the revenue obtained by the retention tax with the United Kingdom. As for the withholding taxes levied by Member States under the Directive, under Article 10 the United Kingdom will make provision to ensure income subject to retention is not subject to double taxation.<br/><br/>
Article 12 provides for a consultation procedure, in the event of any disagreement between the parties as to the interpretation of the Agreement and Article 13 sets out the confidentiality provisions concerning the information.<br/><br/>
Article 14 confirms that Jersey will move to full, automatic exchange of information at the end of the transitional period, with the option to do so earlier if wished.<br/><br/>
Articles 15-17 deal with commencement and the conditions for application of the Agreement.<br/><br/>
The Agreement will enter into force on the date of the later of the notifications by each country of the completion of its legislative procedures or the date of application of the Directive (1st July 2005) whichever is later. The date of entry into force will in due course be published in the <i>London, Edinburgh</i> and <i>Belfast Gazettes.</i><br/><br/>
