(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend The General Teaching Council for England (Registration of Teachers) Regulations 2000. They make provision for the Register of Teachers maintained by the General Teaching Council for England to record additional information against the names of registered teachers. The register will record information relating to whether they have passed the performance threshold, the date upon which they passed it and the school at which they were teaching when they passed it. Teachers who gained qualified Teacher Status between 1 May 2000 and 30 April 2001 but have not yet passed or failed their induction period will have recorded against their name whether they have passed the national numeracy test and if they have not, the number of times they have taken it.<BR><BR>
In addition the Register will record the terms of disciplinary orders made by the General Teaching Council for England or the General Teaching Council for Wales. Reprimands issued by either of these Councils are to remain on the Register for a period of two years from the date the reprimand is issued.<BR><BR>
The Regulations also make provision for this information, with the exception of the number of attempts the teacher has had at the numeracy test, to be passed to employers upon request.<BR><BR>
Teacher supply agencies are added to the list of employers who may request such information.<BR><BR>
Appropriate Bodies who are administering the induction arrangements will be give access to the induction information only.<BR><BR>
Upon request, the Council will inform the National College for School Leadership of whether an applicant for the National Professional Qualification for Headship is a qualified teacher and whether they have been awarded the National Qualification for Headship.<BR><BR>
