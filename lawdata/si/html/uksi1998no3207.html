This Order designates the Borough of Luton as both a permitted parking area and a special parking area in accordance with Schedule 3 to the Road Traffic Act 1991 and applies with modifications specified provisions of Part II of that Act to the areas so designated (referred to in the Order as "the parking area"). In particular paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 modifies section 73 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 in relation to the parking area so as to provide for parking adjudicators appointed by the Joint Committee of London Authorities constituted under that section to act as adjudicators in relation to the parking area. The Order also modifies the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 in relation to that area (Schedule 2).<BR><BR>
