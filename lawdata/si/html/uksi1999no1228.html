These Regulations further amend the Plant Protection Products Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/887) as amended ("the principal Regulations") which implement in Great Britain Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (OJ No. L230, 19.8.91, p. 1 as read with OJ No. L170, 25.6.92, p. 40) ("the Directive"), as amended.<BR><BR>
The Regulations amend the definition of "the Directive" provided in the principal Regulations in consequence of Commission Directive 97/73/EC (OJ No. L353, 24.12.97, p. 26) and Commission Directive 1999/1/EC (OJ No. L21, 28.1.99, p. 21) which insert two active substances (respectively Imazalil and Kresoxim Methyl) into Annex I to the Directive. The Regulations also make consequential amendments to the Plant Protection Products (Fees) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/888) as amended.<BR><BR>
The Regulations revoke the Plant Protection Products (Amendment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/1940) and the Plant Protection Products (Amendment) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/2760), both of which make amendments that are consolidated in the amendments made by the present Regulations.<BR><BR>
