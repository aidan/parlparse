(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations make transitional provision and consequential amendments, for the purposes of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, to primary and secondary legislation affecting pre-1993 Act transfer of control agreements, religious education trusts, baseline assessments, the provision of information relating to schools, school performance targets, temporary exceptions from the national curriculum, pupil registration, and disqualifications for election and holding office as a member of a local authority.<BR><BR>
The Education (References to Delegated Budgets and Revocation) Regulations 1999, the provisions of which are either spent or no longer serve a useful purpose, are revoked with savings in respect of determinations made by local education authorities in relation to the staffing at schools for non-school activities.<BR><BR>
