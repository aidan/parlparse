These Regulations further amend the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Regulations 1993 ("the 1993 Regulations"). Their primary purpose is to require that the engine power recorded for fishing vessels is the maximum continuous engine power, or that power as permanently de-rated, as required by Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2930/86 of 22nd September 1986 (defining characteristics for fishing vessels) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 1381/87 of 20th May 1987 (establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels).<BR><BR>
The Regulations also make minor and drafting amendments to the 1993 Regulations.<BR><BR>
The Regulations also further amend the Merchant Shipping (Tonnage) Regulations 1997 and the Merchant Shipping (Fishing Vessels&nbsp;-&nbsp;Tonnage) Regulations 1988, to ensure that the term "fixed permanent structure" includes all structures which are fixed in place during the normal operation of the ship. (The term is used in the definition of "length overall", and applied both for the purposes of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2930/86 and for the measurement of tonnage otherwise than under that Council Regulation.)<BR><BR>
