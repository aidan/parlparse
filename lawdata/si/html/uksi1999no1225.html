</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order provides for lay representatives to continue to exercise rights of audience in small claims cases in the county courts. Section 11 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 has been amended to facilitate the making of new Civil Procedure Rules, under which small claims cases are no longer referred to arbitration, but are allocated to a small claims track. This Order does not alter current practice, but is made as a consequence of those changes.<BR><BR>
