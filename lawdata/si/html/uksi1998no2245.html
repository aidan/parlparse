</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the Plant Health (Great Britain) Order 1993. It provides that an inspector may require the occupier or other person in charge of premises where an examination of material imported from a third country is taking place to provide suitable inspection areas where appropriate, adequate lighting, and inspection tables.<BR><BR>
In doing so, the Order implements Commission Directive 98/22/EC (OJ No. L126, 28.4.98, p.26) laying down the minimum conditions for carrying out plant health checks in the Community, at inspection posts other than those at the place of destination, of plants, plant products or other objects coming from third countries.<BR><BR>
