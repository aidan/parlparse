(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Section 10 of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 provides for certain classes of people to be disqualified from entitlement to be MEPs. Section 21 of the European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003 amended section 10 of the 2002 Act so as to give the Secretary of State power to disqualify persons of a description connected to Gibraltar. The Order provides for similar classes of people to be disqualified as those who are disqualified in the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>
