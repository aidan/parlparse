Section 41 of the Competition Act 1998 confers immunity from penalties for infringement of the Chapter I prohibition where a party has notified an agreement to the European Commission seeking an exemption under Article 81(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and before the Commission determines the matter. If however the Commission withdraws from the agreement the benefit of "provisional immunity from penalties" then the immunity under section 41 also ceases to apply. These Regulations prescribe what is meant by "provisional immunity from penalties" by reference to the First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (now Articles 81 and 82), and the implementing regulations in respect of maritime transport and air transport. Under each of these regulations the Commission may withdraw immunity from fines in respect of notified agreements by informing the undertakings concerned that, after preliminary examination, it is of the opinion that Article 81(1) of the Treaty applies and that application of Article 81(3) is not justified.<BR><BR>
