<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order confirms byelaws made by the Verderers of the New Forest in exercise of their powers under section 25 of the New Forest Act 1877. The new byelaws revoke and replace with amendments the previous byelaws made by the Verderers and the Order revokes the order confirming the revoked byelaws.<BR><BR>
The byelaws make provision in relation to: &nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) prohibiting unauthorised animals from being in the Forest (byelaw 4);<BR><BR>
(b) appointing persons to be responsible for the management of animals (byelaw 5);<BR><BR>
(c) the marking of animals and the making of payments to the Verderers for the exercise of certain rights (byelaws 6 to 8, 22 and 23);<BR><BR>
(d) protection of the health of animals in the Forest (byelaws 9 to 13);<BR><BR>
(e) the identification of animals in the Forest and the use of marks (byelaws 14 and 15);<BR><BR>
(f) drifts or rounding up animals in the Forest (byelaw 16);<BR><BR>
(g) feeding animals in the Forest (byelaw 17);<BR><BR>
(h) prohibiting the admission of animals to land that the Verderers have authorised the Forestry Commissioners (on behalf of the Secretary of State) to enclose (byelaw 18);<BR><BR>
(i) the disposal of carcasses (byelaw 19);<BR><BR>
(j) damage to fences and gates and keeping gates closed (byelaw 20).<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
By byelaw 3 offences contrary to the byelaws are made punishable by fines not exceeding level one on the standard scale (currently two hundred pounds). Section 25(4) of the New Forest Act 1877, as amended by section 12 of the New Forest Act 1964, provides for the imposition of a fine of up to ten pounds for any breach of the byelaws. By virtue of section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 the maximum fine for an offence under the byelaws is increased to level one on the standard scale.<BR><BR>
Byelaw 21 makes further provision with respect to enforcement, including the ability for the Verderers to remove animals from the Forest following a breach.<BR><BR>
