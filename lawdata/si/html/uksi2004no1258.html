(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order brings into force the variations to the Public Lending Right Scheme 1982 made on 30th April 2004. These variations extend the countries from which authors can register under the Scheme to include those countries that will be part of the European Economic Area from 1st May 2004. Rather than listing all EEA States separately, the Order includes a definition that describes an EEA State as meaning a member State of the European Union together with Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.<BR><BR>
