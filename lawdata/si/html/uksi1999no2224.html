(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Films (Certification) Regulations 1985, which prescribe the particulars necessary to satisfy the Secretary of State that a film is a British film for the purposes of Schedule 1 to the Films Act 1985, as amended by the Films (Modification of the Definition of "British Film" Order 1999).<BR><BR>
The amendments have been made in consequence of the Films (Modification of the Definition of "British Film") Order 1999, which modified the criteria for the certification of films as "British films".<BR><BR>
The amendments substitute particulars that reflect the requirements of the modified definition of "British film", and make other minor and consequential amendments to the Regulations.<BR><BR>
