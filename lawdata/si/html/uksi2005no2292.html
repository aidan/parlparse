<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</b><br/><br/><i>
(This note is not part of the Rules)</i></center><br/><br/>
These Rules add the following new provisions to the Civil Procedure Rules 1998&#8212;<br/><br/>
&#8212; A new rule 3.7A, which provides sanctions for non-payment of fees in respect of counterclaims.<br/><br/>

&#8212; A new rule 6.11 and 6.11A, in substitution for the existing rule 6.11, which require the court to notify a party (who has requested it to serve a document) if that document is subsequently returned to the court or the court bailiff is unable to serve it.<br/><br/>
&#8212; A new rule 19.7B, which makes provision for an application under section 92 of the Postal Services Act 2000 for permission to bring proceedings in the name of the sender or addressee of a postal packet to be made.<br/><br/>

&#8212; A new rule 27.14(2A), which provides that the rejection of an offer to settle in cases on the small claims track does not itself constitute unreasonable behaviour, but may be taken into account when the court considers the reasonableness of the parties' conduct generally.<br/><br/>

&#8212; A new rule 44.13(1A), which provides that where certain categories of order are silent with respect to costs, the order will be deemed to include an order for costs in the case.<br/><br/>

&#8212; A new rule 55.10A, which enables a practice direction to make provision for a claimant to start certain types of possession claim in certain courts by requesting the issue of a claim form electronically.<br/><br/>
&#8212; A new rule 60.7 which clarifies the position in the Technology and Construction Court that parties will draw up orders, unless the court orders otherwise. Similar provision is made for the Queen's Bench Division at the Royal Courts of Justice, by an amendment to rule 40.3.<br/><br/>
&#8212; A new rule 63.4A, which makes provision to secure that as far as practicable and appropriate, proceedings in the patents county court are dealt with by the patents judge. Consequential amendment is made to rule 63.1 to introduce a definition of patents judge.<br/><br/>

Consequential amendments are made to rule 74.1.<br/><br/>

&#8212; Rules 12.10 and 12.11 (Default judgment obtained by making an application) are amended to make changes to the Civil Procedure Rules consequential upon the Civil Partnership Act 2004.<br/><br/>
&#8212; Rule 26.4 (Stay to allow for settlement of case) is amended to allow the court greater flexibility when making an order staying the proceedings to allow the parties the opportunity to consider alternative dispute resolution.<br/><br/>

&#8212; Rule 27.9 (Non-attendance of parties at final hearing) is amended to require a party who will not be attending a hearing to notify the other party and serve on such party any documents filed at court.<br/><br/>
&#8212; Rule 27.14 (Costs on the small claims track) is amended to provide that when a claim is allocated to the small claims track by consent, the small claims costs provisions will apply unless the parties agree otherwise.<br/><br/>
&#8212; Rule 28.5 (Pre-trial checklist) and rule 29.6 (Pre-trial checklist) are amended to provide that in claims on the fast track and multi-track, respectively, if no party files a pre-trial checklist the claim/defence will be struck out and if one party files, the file will be submitted to the judge to give directions.<br/><br/>
&#8212; Rule 30.8 (Transfer of competition law claims) is amended to allow commercial claims (within rule 58.1), which raise an issue of competition law to be heard in the Commercial Court.<br/><br/>
&#8212; Rule 65.11, rule 65.12, rule 65.13, rule 65.14, rule 65.17, rule 65.18 and rule 65.19 are amended to make provision for suspension claims under section 121A of the Housing Act 1985 to be made. Consequential amendments are made to Part 55.<br/><br/>
