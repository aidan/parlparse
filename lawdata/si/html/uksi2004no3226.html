This Order provides for the enforcement in England of Commission Regulation (EC) 2244/2003 (OJ No L333, 20.12.03. p.17.) laying down detailed provisions regarding satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems ("the Commission Regulation").<BR><BR>
Articles 5 to 9 of the Order create offences for contravening requirements relating to: the installation of a satellite-tracking device (article 5); the switching off of a satellite-tracking device in port without prior notification (article 6); the information to be transmitted by the satellite-tracking device (article 7); the responsibilities relating to a satellite-tracking device (article 8) and the technical failure or non-functioning of a satellite-tracking device (article 9).<BR><BR>
Articles 11 to 14 apply to third country fishing boats within relevant British fishery limits. They create offences for contravening requirements relating to: the installation of a satellite-tracking device (article 11); the information to be transmitted by the satellite-tracking device (article 12); the responsibilities relating to the satellite-tracking device (article 13) and the technical failure or non-functioning of the satellite tracking device (article 14).<BR><BR>
The Order provides that the person guilty of an offence under it, other than an offence under article 19, is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £50,000, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine. The Order also provides for the recovery of fines imposed, or treated as imposed, by a magistrates' court (article 16).<BR><BR>
For the purposes of enforcing the Commission Regulation the Order confers on British sea-fishery officers the powers to: board fishing boats; test any equipment on board; require the production of documentation relating to the boat, equipment, or fishing or ancillary operations; search the boat; remove the satellite-tracking device or any other equipment on the boat; and take the boat to the nearest convenient port and detain the boat (article 17). Protection of such officers from liability is provided for in article 18. Failing to comply with requirements imposed by officers or obstructing them in the exercise of their powers is an offence under article 19, carrying liability to a fine up to the statutory maximum on summary conviction or a fine on conviction on indictment. Articles 20 and 21 deal with corporate and equivalent offences and admissibility of documents in evidence.<BR><BR>
Article 22 revokes the Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Satellite Monitoring Measures) Order 2000 as it extends to England.<BR><BR>
A Regulatory Impact Assessment in relation to this Order has been prepared and placed in the library of each House of Parliament. Copies can be obtained from Defra, Fisheries Division IV, Room 313, Whitehall Place East, London, SW1A 2HH.<BR><BR>

Article 3(1) of, and Schedule 1 to, the Scotland Act 1998 (Concurrent Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/1592) provide for the functions exercisable under section 30(2) of the 1981 Act to be exercised by the Ministers, concurrently with the Scottish Ministers, in relation to: British fishing boats (other than Scottish ones) within the Scottish zone; and Scottish fishing boats within British fishery limits but outside the Scottish zone.
