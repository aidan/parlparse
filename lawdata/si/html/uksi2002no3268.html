<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order alters the constitution of the Gloucester Harbour Trustees.<BR><BR>
The previous constitution provided for 10 trustees to be appointed by various appointing bodies, for one trustee to be appointed as representative of pilots and for up to two trustees to be appointed by the other trustees. The new constitution provides for a body of 10 trustees of whom nine are to be appointed by the Trustees. The remaining trustee is to be the principal operational officer thereby securing executive representation on the Trustees. Provision is included to enable a gradual transition to the new appointment arrangements. The Order also makes provision to govern the selection and terms of appointment of trustees and the manner in which they are to conduct business.<BR><BR>
The Order also extends the seaward limits of the harbour and repeals ancient legislation relating to the River Wye.<BR><BR>
