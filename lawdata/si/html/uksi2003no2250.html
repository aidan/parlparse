This Order makes provision consequential on the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 ("the Act").<BR><BR>
The Act, amongst other things, confers and regulates rights of access to land for recreational and other purposes (Part 1 of the Act).

Article 2 requires the Secretary of State to review certain directions and to prepare and lay a report before each House of Parliament in any calendar year where a defence direction has been reviewed.<BR><BR>
Provision is also made in article 2 for the Secretary of State to inform the public of the effect of any direction on access rights pursuant to the Act.<BR><BR>
