<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the borough of Thurrock. The recommendations were submitted to the Secretary of State, but the functions of the Secretary of State under sections 13 to 15 and 17 of the Local Government Act 1992 so far as they relate to electoral changes were transferred with modifications to the Electoral Commission under The Local Government Commission for England (Transfer of Functions) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/3962), with effect from 1st April 2002. That Order provides that recommendations submitted to the Secretary of State before 1st April would have effect as if they had been submitted to the Electoral Commission.<BR><BR>
The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 6th May 2004.<BR><BR>
Article 3 abolishes the existing wards of the borough and provides for the creation of 20 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 4 makes provision for a whole council election in 2004 and for reversion to the established system of election by thirds in subsequent years. Schedule 2 provides for the order of retirement of councillors.<BR><BR>
Article 6 obliges the Electoral Registration officer to make any necessary amendments to the electoral register to reflect the new electoral arrangements.<BR><BR>
Article 7 revokes the Borough of Thurrock (Electoral Changes) Order 1997 (S.I. 1997/775) with the exception of article 3(1) and 3(11).<BR><BR>
The areas of the new borough wards are demarcated on the map described in article 2. Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Thurrock Borough Council and at the principal office of the Electoral Commission, Trevelyan House, Great Peter Street, London SW1P 2HW.<BR><BR>
