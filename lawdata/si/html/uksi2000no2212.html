These Regulations, which supersede the Land Registration (Conduct of Business) Regulations 1997, make amendments to the acts of the Registrar which may be done by a legally qualified registrar, called the Solicitor to HM Land Registry, or, during a vacancy in the office of, or in the absence of, the Solicitor to HM Land Registry, by another legally qualified registrar (called the Acting Solicitor to HM Land Registry). They further provide for those acts to be done by another legally qualified registrar (called the Deputy Solicitor to HM Land Registry) for the purpose of determining a matter under rule 299 of the Land Registration Rules 1925 (hearing before the Registrar) and making an order as to costs following such a determination, where such registrar has been nominated by the Registrar to have the conduct of hearings.<BR><BR>
