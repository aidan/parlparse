(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The City of Newcastle upon Tyne Act 2000 and the London Local Authorities Act 1995 both make provision for the setting up of a register of door supervisors and make it an offence to act as, or employ, an unregistered door supervisor. This Order modifies those enactments to provide that it is a defence to any prosecution to show that the person acting as, or employed as, a door supervisor was licensed to engage in that activity by the Security Industry Authority and was complying with the terms of his licence.<BR><BR>
Article 4 of this Order revokes the Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Modification of Local Enactments) Order 2004 which contained a defect.<BR><BR>
