</UL><P>
</UL><P>
Regulation 2(4) amends Part 2 of Schedule 1 (Interpretation of Part 1) to the PPC Regulations to exclude from the scope of those Regulations activities carried out in installations or mobile plant used solely for research and development and testing of new products and processes.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2(5) adds a new exclusion covering animal rendering activities to the list in paragraph 17 of Part 3 of Schedule 1 (Interpretation of "Part A Installation" etc) to the PPC Regulations.<BR><BR>

Regulation 2(8) modifies in Schedule 7 (Variation of Conditions) to the PPC Regulations the references to the public consultation provisions in Schedule 4, as amended by these Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2(9) inserts in paragraph 1 of Schedule 9 (Registers) to the PPC Regulations a requirement to keep information on fees and charges paid to the local authority regulator under a scheme made under regulation 22 of those Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 amends regulation 16 of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/1056) to refer in paragraphs 1(ba) and (3) to all Part A installations for the purposes of the PPC Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 includes transitional provisions for installations or mobile plant which as a result of these Regulations are reclassified as falling within a different Part in any Section in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the PPC Regulations, or whose prescribed date or relevant date is deferred to a date after the coming into force of these Regulations.<BR><BR>
