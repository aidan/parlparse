These Regulations, which apply to England and Wales, amend the Contaminants in Food Regulations 1997 by bringing up to date a reference to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 194/97 (as amended) setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs, so as to cover its further amendment by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1566/1999 which altered the date by which the maximum aflatoxin limits laid down for nuts and dried fruit have to be reconsidered by the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs from 1st July 1999 to 1st July 2001 and similarly altered the date from which specified maximum limits will apply to cereals.<BR><BR>
