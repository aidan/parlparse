Whereas, pursuant to section 18(1) of the Agriculture Act 1986[<a name="n1"><a href="#note1">1</A>], the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ("the Minister") has by order designated an area in Dartmoor as an environmentally sensitive area ("the designated area");<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the designated area;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to conserve the flora and fauna and geological and physiographical features of that area; and<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to protect buildings and other objects of historic interest in that area;<BR><BR>

Now therefore, the Minister, in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 18(1) and (4)[<a name="n2"><a href="#note2">2</A>] of the said Act, and of all other powers enabling him in that behalf, with the consent of the Treasury and after consultation with the Secretary of State, the Countryside Agency and the Nature Conservancy Council for England[<a name="n3"><a href="#note3">3</A>], in accordance with section 99 of the Environment Act 1995[<a name="n4"><a href="#note4">4</A>], makes the following Order:<BR><BR>

</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (Dartmoor) Designation Order 1994 ("the principal Order") as amended, which designated an area in Dartmoor as an environmentally sensitive area, in implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2078/92 (OJ No. L215, 30.7.92, p. 85) on agricultural production methods compatible with the requirements of protection of the environment and the maintenance of the countryside, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 2772/95 (OJ No. L288, 1.12.95, p. 35) as in turn rectified by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1962/96 (OJ No. L259, 12.10.96).<BR><BR>
This Order replaces the Schedules to the principal Order (laying down detailed requirements of the scheme) by two new Schedules specifying the capital and management activities in respect of which payments may be made, and specifies the maximum payments in respect of such activities (<I>articles 7 and 8</I>).<BR><BR>
In addition some modifications are made to the definitions set out in article 2(1) of the principal Order (<I>article 4</I>).<BR><BR>
The provisions of the principal Order that are amended or revoked do not include any that derive from the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (England) Designation Orders (Amendment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/3104); those which derive from S.I. 1996/3104 are revoked with a saving, by the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (England) Designation Orders (Revocation of Specified Provisions) Regulations 1999, which come into force on 30th August 1999.<BR><BR>
No regulatory impact assessment has been made in respect of this Order.<BR><BR>
