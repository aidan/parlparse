<UL>
(a) when he attains normal benefit age, or<BR><BR>
(b) if it is later, when the pension sharing order under which he is entitled to the pension credit takes effect.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The pension must be of such an amount that its actuarial value is equal to the member's pension credit, as calculated from tables prepared by the Government Actuary and in accordance with regulations made under paragraph 5(b) of Schedule 5 to the 1999 Act.<BR><BR>
<B>
Commutation: general provision</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
M2.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) Subject to regulation M3, a pension credit member may opt to commute for a lump sum a portion of the pension (not exceeding one-quarter) to which he is entitled under regulation M1&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) when he attains normal benefit age, or<BR><BR>
(b) if it is later, when the pension sharing order under which he is entitled to the pension credit takes effect.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The lump sum under paragraph (1) is the actuarial equivalent of the commuted portion of the pension, calculated from tables prepared by the Government Actuary.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) But the lump sum may not exceed the annual rate of the pension as at the time when it first becomes payable (disregarding any reduction under this regulation or any other provision of the Scheme), multiplied by 2.25.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) This rule does not apply to a pension derived from pension credit rights if the pension debit member from whose rights the pension is derived has received a lump sum under rule B7 before the date on which the pension sharing order takes effect.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A person who wishes the relevant police authority to commute a pension under paragraph (1) must not later than six months after&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the date on which the person attains normal benefit age, or<BR><BR>

(a) reduce the pension, as from the effective date, by the commuted portion, and<BR><BR>
(b) pay him the lump sum, reduced where the effective date is the date of receipt of the notice by the difference between the aggregate payments made in respect of the pension and the aggregate payments that would have been made in respect of it if it had been reduced from&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) the date on which the person attains normal benefit age, or<BR><BR>
(ii) the date on which the pension sharing order takes effect,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
whichever is the later.<BR><BR>

<B>
Commutation of the pension credit benefit: small pensions and serious ill-health</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
M3.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) The relevant police authority may commute the pension to which a pension credit member is entitled under regulation M1 for a lump sum in accordance with the following provisions of this regulation.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the pension credit member is suffering from serious ill-health before normal benefit age&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the whole of the pension may be commuted, and<BR><BR>
(b) the lump sum under paragraph (1) is an amount equal to the annual rate of the pension as at the time when it first becomes payable, multiplied by 5.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the aggregate of total benefits payable to the member, including those attributable (directly or indirectly) to pension credit rights, does not exceed £260 per annum at normal benefit age&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the whole of the pension may be commuted when the pension credit member attains normal benefit age or when the pension sharing order takes effect if that is later, and<BR><BR>
(b) the lump sum under paragraph (1) is the actuarial equivalent of the commuted pension, calculated from tables prepared by the Government Actuary.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where a pension is commuted under this rule, the payment of the lump sum discharges the relevant police authority from all liability in respect of benefits payable to or in respect of the pension credit member.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In this regulation "serious ill-health" means ill-health giving rise to a life expectancy of less than one year.<BR><BR>
<B>
Death grants where pension credit member dies before pension credit benefits payable</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
M4.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) If a pension credit member dies before any benefits deriving from the member's pension credit have become payable to him under these Regulations, a lump sum death grant is to be paid of an amount equal to the annual rate of the pension to which the member would have been entitled under regulation M1 if he had attained normal benefit age on the date of his death (as calculated in accordance with guidance prepared by the Government Actuary), multiplied by 2.25.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The lump sum is payable&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the following Regulations, as they have effect in England and Wales: the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 ("the 1987 Regulations"), which provide for the superannuation of members of police forces, the Police Pensions (Purchase of Increased Benefits) Regulations 1987, which enable police officers to purchase additional benefits and the Police Pensions (Additional Voluntary Contributions) Regulations 1991 ("the AVC Regulations"), which make provision for the payment of additional voluntary contributions by police officers to secure additional pension benefits.<BR><BR>
The amendments make provision for the implementation of pension sharing on divorce and nullity in accordance with the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 ("the 1999 Act") and subordinate legislation made under that Act.<BR><BR>
Regulation 1 provides for citation and commencement and for the Regulations to have effect from 1st December 2000.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2 and Schedule 1 provide for the amendment of the 1987 Regulations as respects pension debit members (the police officers whose rights are reduced by pension sharing orders) and pension credit members (the ex-spouses in whose favour pension sharing orders have been made).<BR><BR>
Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 amends regulation A10 to provide for the reduction of the amount of aggregate pension contributions. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 amends regulation B8(1) so that pension credit members' pensions are considered in determining if pensions can be commuted on the grounds of triviality. Paragraph 3 inserts regulation B12 under which pension debit members' awards are calculated subject to the overriding reduction. Paragraph 4 inserts regulation C10 under which pension debit members' surviving spouses' awards are similarly reduced. Paragraph 5 inserts regulation D6 which provides that pension debit members' children's awards are first calculated as if the member were not a pension debit member and are then reduced to the extent required by section 31 of the 1999 Act. Paragraph 6 inserts regulation E11 under which awards on the death of pension debit members are reduced. Paragraph 7 makes provision about certificates relating to pension debit members. Paragraph 8 inserts regulation F10A which prevents a transfer in respect of pension credit rights being accepted by the scheme.<BR><BR>
Paragraph 9 applies regulation K5 (forfeiture) to pension credit members' pensions. Paragraph 10 amends regulation L1 to make the police authority that employed the pension debit member when the pension sharing order was made the authority exercising functions for the pension credit member. Paragraph 11 applies regulation L4 (payment to non-beneficiaries).<BR><BR>
Paragraph 12 inserts a new Part M making provision about pension credit members. The new regulations in Part M set out the pension credit member's entitlement to a pension in respect of his pension credit at normal benefit age (60) or, if later, the date when the pension sharing order takes effect, for the commutation of the pension and for a death grant to be payable if the member dies before the pension is payable. Regulation M5 disapplies most regulations of the Scheme for these members, except the regulations mentioned in the new regulation M5(2).<BR><BR>
Paragraph 13 inserts a number of new definitions into Schedule A.<BR><BR>
Paragraphs 14 to 17 make consequential amendments of Schedules B and F (calculation of pensions and transfer values).<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 amends the Police Pensions (Purchase of Increased Benefits) Regulations 1987 to prevent pension debit members from purchasing rights to replace those debited by a pension sharing order, except in the circumstances allowed under regulations made under paragraph 18(10) or (11) of Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 1999.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 and Schedule 2 provide for the amendment of the AVC Regulations. Regulation 4(2) prevents those Regulations applying to pension credit members as such except so far as provided by Schedule 2. Regulations 2, 10, 15 and 16 are amended and a new regulation 10A is inserted which gives effect to a new Schedule 1A (see paragraphs 3 and 6 of Schedule 2 to these Regulations).<BR><BR>
The new Schedule 1A to the AVC Regulations makes provision for the discharge of liability in respect of a pension credit by the relevant police authority, the discharge of liability if the person entitled to the pension credit dies before liability has been discharged, the payment of pension credit benefit at or after normal benefit age, the commutation of pension credit benefit before or at normal benefit age, and the payment of pension credit benefit as a lump sum after the death of the pension credit member before the pension credit benefit becomes payable.<BR><BR>
Provision is also made for the investment of pension credit rights in a way which is similar to the investment of additional voluntary contributions under the AVC Regulations. The transfer of pension credit rights out of the AVC scheme is also provided for.<BR><BR>
The amendments do not impose any costs on business.<BR><BR>
