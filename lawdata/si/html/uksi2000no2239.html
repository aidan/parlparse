<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1967), the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/207), the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1971) and the Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992/1814).<BR><BR>
In particular, they provide that&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;certain persons aged between 55 and 60 whose spouse has died may be entitled to income support (regulation 2(2));&nbsp;-&nbsp;subject to certain conditions, an additional premium is payable in those benefits to such persons where a person's entitlement to a bereavement allowance has expired, the premium only being payable until 9th April 2006 (regulation 2(3), 3(2), 4(2) and 5(2));&nbsp;-&nbsp;certain amounts of a widowed mother's allowance and widowed parent's allowance are disregarded for the purpose of ascertaining entitlement to those benefits (regulation 2(4), 3(3), 4(3)(a) and 5(3)(a)).Regulations 4(3)(b) and 5(3)(b) make consequential amendments.<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 provides for the provisions of these Regulations (apart from those relating to the disregard of widowed mother's allowance and widowed parent's allowance) to cease to have effect on 10th April 2006. By this date, all those entitled to income support by virtue of the amendment made by regulation 2(2), will be eligible to claim that benefit because they have attained the age of 60 when the premium payable under regulations 2(3), 3(2), 4(2) and 5(2) will be replaced by a pensioner premium of a higher value.<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose a charge on business.<BR><BR>
