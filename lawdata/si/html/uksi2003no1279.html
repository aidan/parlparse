<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order revokes and replaces the Disease Control (Interim Measures) (England) Order 2003. It changes the provisions of that Order as follows&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li> It creates a new requirement that all sheep and goats being moved to a show or exhibition must be marked with an individual number (article 4);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li> It permits movement of pigs, cattle, sheep and goats to shows and exhibitions from premises under standstill under specified conditions (paragraphs 11 and 12 of Schedule 1) and provides that the return of these animals from a show or exhibition will not trigger a standstill on the premises under certain conditions (paragraph 4 of Schedule 2).<BR><BR>
As before, the Order provides that cattle, deer, goats, pigs and sheep may not be moved without a licence, and provides that these animals (with the exception of deer) may not be moved from premises if cattle, goats or sheep have been moved on to those premises in the previous 6 days (the "standstill period" triggered by movement of those animals), or if pigs have been moved on in the previous 20 days (the "standstill period" triggered by movement of pigs). It also provides for exceptions from these requirements (article 3 and Schedules 1 and 2). Schedule 1 lists the movements off premises which are permitted during the standstill period and Schedule 2 lists the movements on to premises that do not trigger the standstill period.<BR><BR>
It controls movement of animals to and from slaughterhouses (article 5) and provides for sets of premises to be linked together as sole occupancy groups (article 6).<BR><BR>
It makes provisions for licences, permits and authorisations, and empowers the Secretary of State to serve notices removing individual premises or people from operating under a general licence (articles 7 to 13).<BR><BR>
It provides for disinfection of vehicles (article 14).<BR><BR>
It provides for change of occupation of premises affected by the Order (article 15).<BR><BR>
It is enforced by the local authority or the Secretary of State (article 16).<BR><BR>
Breach of the Order is an offence under section 73 of the Animal Health Act 1981, punishable in accordance with section 75 of that Act.<BR><BR>
A regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared for this Order.<BR><BR>
