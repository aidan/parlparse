(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations revoke the Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Satellite Monitoring Measures) Order 2000 Amendment Regulations 2001 in so far as they extend to England.<BR><BR>
The 2001 Regulations amended the Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Satellite Monitoring Measures) Order 2000 (SI 2000/181) which is itself being replaced. The 2000 Order provides for the enforcement of Articles 3 and 28c of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 (O.J. No. L261, 20.10.93, p.1.) establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy and Commission Regulation (EC) 1489/97 (O.J. No. L202, 30.07.97, p.18.) laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 as regards satellite-based vessel monitoring systems. The amendments in the 2001 Regulations were made in order to improve the effectiveness of the monitoring procedures required by that legislation.<BR><BR>
