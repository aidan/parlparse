These Regulations amend the Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992/1814), the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1971), the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1967) and the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/207) in so far as those Regulations apply to students.<BR><BR>
In particular, they increase the disregard for grants paid for an eldest or dependent child and in respect of expenditure on travel, books and equipment under the Education (Student Support) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/195).<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose any charge on business.<BR><BR>
