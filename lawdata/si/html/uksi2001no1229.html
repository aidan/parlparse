</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations make the following amendments of substance to the Measuring Equipment (Cold-water Meters) Regulations 1988 which apply to cold-water meters for use for trade in the measuring of the supply of water for domestic purposes in England and Wales.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Regulations are extended to Scotland (regulations 4 and 8).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The application of the Regulations is changed. They now apply to meters for the supply of cold water to domestic premises in place of its supply for domestic purposes (regulation 4).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) References to British Standards have been updated (regulations 3 and 5).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provision is made for dispensing with testing of cold-water meters imported from another State of the European Economic Area (regulations 6 and 7).<BR><BR>
The British Standards referred to in regulations 3, 5 and 6 are available from any of the sales outlets operated by the British Standards Institution or from the British Standards Institution, Linford Wood, Milton Keynes MK14 6LE.<BR><BR>
A Regulatory Impact Assessment in respect of these Regulations is available and a copy may be obtained from the National Weights and Measures Laboratory (an Executive Agency of the Department of Trade and Industry), Stanton Avenue, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 0JZ. A copy has been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament.<BR><BR>
