</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order is made under section 1 of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 (c. 6). It reforms the law relating to the maximum limit of 20 on the numbers of persons who can be members of partnerships (including limited partnerships), and of certain companies or associations, which has the effect of imposing burdens on people carrying out certain activities with a view to reducing those burdens in respect of the formation of such bodies. It does so by repealing sections 716 and 717 of the Companies Act 1985 (c. 6) and amending section 4(2) of the Limited Partnerships Act 1907 (c. 37), thereby removing the maximum limits on the number of members in a partnership or limited partnership, company or association. It repeals consequentially section 127 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (c. 52) which exempts employers' associations from the 20 member limit in section 716.<BR><BR>
