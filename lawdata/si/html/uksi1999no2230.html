&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Deduct £103 from this figure in the case of animals for which the net annual income does not include a sum in respect of the premium for maintaining suckler cows (suckler cow premium) provided for in Article 4d of Council Regulation 805/68 (Article 6 of Council Regulation 1254/99)[<a name="n9"><a href="#note9">9</A>].<BR><BR>
<UL>
Add £26 to the figure in column 3 in the case of animals for which the net annual income includes a sum in respect of the lower rate of extensification premium provided for in Article 4h of Council Regulation 805/68 (Article 13 of Council Regulation 1254/99)[<a name="n10"><a href="#note10">10</A>].</UL><P>
<UL>
Add £37 to the figure in column 3 in the case of animals for which the net annual income includes a sum in respect of the higher rate of extensification premium provided for in Article 4h of Council Regulation 805/68 (Article 13 of Council Regulation 1254/99)[<a name="n11"><a href="#note11">11</A>].</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This is the figure for animals which are kept for 12 months.<BR><BR>
<UL>
Deduct £82 in the case of animals which are kept for 12 months and for which the net annual income does not include a sum in respect of the special premium for holding male bovine animals (beef special premium) provided for in Article 4b of Council Regulation 805/68 (Article 4 of Council Regulation 1254/99)[<a name="n12"><a href="#note12">12</A>].</UL><P>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order prescribes units of production for the assessment of the productive capacity of agricultural land situated in England and sets out the amount which is to be regarded as the net annual income from each such unit for the year 12th September 1999 to 11th September 2000 inclusive. This Order revokes the Agricultural Holdings (Units of Production) Order 1998 in relation to England.<BR><BR>
An assessment of the productive capacity of agricultural land is required in determining whether or not the land in question is a "commercial unit of agricultural land" for the purposes of the succession provisions in the 1986 Act: see in particular sections 36(3) and 50(2). A "commercial unit of agricultural land" is land which, when farmed under competent management, is capable of producing a net annual income which is not less than the aggregate of the average annual earnings of two full-time male agricultural workers aged 20 years or over (paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 to the 1986 Act). In determining this annual income figure, neither the system of farming carried out on a particular holding nor historical data from that holding will necessarily be used. Instead, whenever a particular farming use mentioned in column 1 of the Schedule to this Order is relevant to this determination, the units of production and the net annual income specified in columns 2 and 3 respectively will form thebasis of the assessment of the productive capacity of the land in question.<BR><BR>
The net annual income figures in column 3 of the Schedule specify the net annual income from one unit of production. In some cases the net annual income is derived from a unit which will be on the land for the full twelve-month period. In other cases the net annual income is derived from a unit which will be on the land for only part of the year, and there may be more than one production cycle in the twelve-month period. The assessment of the productive capacity of the land will take account of the total production in the course of a year.<BR><BR>
