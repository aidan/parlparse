<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The regulations contained in this instrument are made by virtue of amendments made to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c. 4) by section 55 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (c. 30) ("the 1999 Act"). This instrument is made before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the coming into force of that section on 9th April 2001 for purposes other than those relating to the making of regulations. The Regulations are therefore exempt, by virtue of section 173(5)(b) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c. 5) from reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee and have not been so referred.<BR><BR>
These Regulations make amendments to the Social Security (Widow's Benefit and Retirement Pensions) Regulations 1979 in relation to the introduction of widowed parent's allowance by virtue of section 55(2) of the 1999 Act, which inserted sections 39A (widowed parent's allowance into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992). A new regulation is inserted to provide for a person to be treated as entitled to child benefit in certain circumstances where eligibility for a widowed parent's allowance is dependent on such entitlement (regulation 2(a)), and an amendment is made to disapply to claims for widowed parent's allowance certain requirements as to the claimant's national insurance number (regulation 2(b)).<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose any costs on business.<BR><BR>
