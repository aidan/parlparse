Regulation 3 provides that the debits and credits prescribed by regulation 4 shall not be brought into account in the first accounting period of a company beginning on or after 1st January 2005, but shall instead be brought into account in the first accounting period of a company beginning on or after 1st January 2006.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 prescribes the debits and credits referred to in regulation 3.<BR><BR>
