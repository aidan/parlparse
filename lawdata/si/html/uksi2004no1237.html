<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order makes provision for the enforcement of certain enforceable Community restrictions and other obligations relating to sea fishing by vessels of the Community or of third countries set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 2287/2003 (OJ No. L344, 31.12.2003, p.1) ("the Council Regulation"). The Council Regulation fixes total allowable catches and Member States' quotas for 2004 and lays down certain conditions under which they may be fished. It also authorises fishing by vessels of Norway and the Faroe Islands for specified descriptions of fish in certain specified areas within Member States' fishery limits in 2004 and imposes requirements concerning fishing quotas and authorised zones, methods of fishing, the holding of licences and observance of licence conditions, the keeping of logbooks, the making of reports and weighing obligations of buyers and holders of fish.<BR><BR>
Article 4 of the Order creates offences in respect of breaches of the provisions of the Council Regulation referred to in column 1 (and briefly described in column 2) of Schedules 1 and 2 to the Order, in the case of Community vessels, and Schedules 2 and 3, in the case of buyers and holders of fish and of third country vessels. Penalties are specified for such offences (article 5). The statutory maximum penalty specified in the Schedules is currently £5,000. Provision is made for the recovery of fines (article 6).<BR><BR>
The Order confers powers of enforcement on British sea-fishery officers in relation to certain fishing boats as well as on land in England and in relation to the seizure of fish and fishing gear (articles 7, 8, 9 and 10). Provision is made for the punishment of anyone found guilty of assaulting or obstructing an officer (article 11).<BR><BR>
This Order does not form part of the law of Scotland or Northern Ireland and does not apply in relation to Wales. It revokes the Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Quota and Third Country Fishing Measures) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/772) insofar as it relates to England.<BR><BR>

1981 c. 29. See section 30(3) for the definitions of "enforceable Community restriction", "enforceable Community obligation" and "the Ministers", as modified by Schedule 2, paragraph 68(5) of the Scotland Act 1998 (Consequential Modifications) (No. 2) Order 1999 (S.I 1999/1820). Article 3(1) and Schedule 1 to the Scotland Act 1998 (Concurrent Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/1592) provide for the functions exercisable under section 30(2) of the 1981 Act to be exercised by the Ministers, concurrently with Scottish Ministers, in relation to: British fishing boats (other than Scottish ones) within the Scottish zone; and Scottish fishing boats within British fishery limits but outside the Scottish zone. By virtue of article 2(a) of, and Schedule 1 to, the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672) the functions exercisable under section 30(2) of the 1981 Act werre transferred to the National Assembly in so far as exercisable in relation to Wales (defined in section 155(1) of the Government of Wales Act 1998 (c. 38) as including "the sea adjacent to Wales out as far as the seaward boundary of the territorial sea"); in respect of waters beyond Wales these functions remain exercisable by the Ministers. By virtue of article 2(1) of the Transfer of Functions (Agriculture and Fisheries) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/1812) any remaining functions of the Secretaries of States for Scotland and Wales under section 30(2) of the 1981 Act were transferred to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. By virtue of article 2(1) of the Transfer of Functions (Agriculture and Fisheries) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/1812), any remaining functions of the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales under section 30(2) of the 1981 Act were transferred to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The functions of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and one or more named Secretaries of State (however described) acting jointly by virtue of article 2(5) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Affairs and the one or more Secretaries of State acting jointly by virtue of article 2(5) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order.<a href="#n1">back</a><p>
