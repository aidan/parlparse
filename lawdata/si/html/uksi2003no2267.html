Part IV of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 allows the Attorney General to refer certain cases to the Court of Appeal, with the leave of that Court, where he considers that a sentence imposed in the Crown Court was unduly lenient. This Order extends the range of offences triable either way in respect of which that power may be exercised.<BR><BR>
