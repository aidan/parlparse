These Regulations amend the Education (Further Education Institutions Information) (England) Regulations 1995 ("the 1995 Regulations"), which require governing bodies of institutions within the further education sector to publish specified information about the educational achievements of their students and their occupations after completing their courses and require the distribution of that information by the governing bodies of maintained, grant-maintained and grant-maintained special schools and the proprietors of city technology colleges and city colleges for the technology of the arts to pupils.<BR><BR>
References to the academic year (1st September to 31st August) are changed to references to the college year (1st August to 31st July) (regulations 3, 4 and 5).<BR><BR>
The date on which the information is to be published and the date by reference to which the information is calculated are changed (regulations 5 and 6).<BR><BR>
Changes are made to the manner in which the information is to be published by reducing the list of bodies to whom copies are to be provided and by enabling publication in electronic form (regulation 6).<BR><BR>
The requirement that the governing bodies of maintained, grant-maintained and grant-maintained special schools and the proprietors of city technology colleges and city colleges for the technology of the arts distribute the published information to pupils in the second year of the fourth key stage is omitted (regulation 7).<BR><BR>
The requirement to publish information in relation to students aged 19 or over is omitted (regulation 8).<BR><BR>
