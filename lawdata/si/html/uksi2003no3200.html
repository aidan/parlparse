&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where profits include items of income or capital gains which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In applying paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article, income or profits attributable to a permanent establishment may, notwithstanding that the permanent establishment has ceased to exist, be taxed in the Contracting State in which it was situated.<BR><BR>

<BR>

<UL>
(a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or<BR><BR>
(b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State&nbsp;-&nbsp;and taxes accordingly&nbsp;-&nbsp;profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.<BR><BR>

Article 10</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>
DIVIDENDS</CENTER>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Dividends paid by a company that is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividend is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the dividends are beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) 5 per cent. of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that owns directly or indirectly at least 20 per cent. of the voting stock of the company paying the dividends;<BR><BR>
(b) 15 per cent. of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
<UL>
This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company's profits out of which the dividends are paid. In the case of Chile, this taxation includes the application of the additional tax.</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights and any other item which, under the laws of the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividend is a resident, is treated as a dividend or distribution of a company.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where a company that is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The provisions of this Article shall not apply if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
Article 11</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>
INTEREST</CENTER>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) 5 per cent. of the gross amount of the interest derived from:<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) loans granted by banks and insurance companies;<BR><BR>
(ii) bonds or securities that are regularly and substantially traded on a recognized securities market;<BR><BR>
(iii) a sale on credit paid by the purchaser of machinery and equipment to a beneficial owner that is the seller of the machinery and equipment.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
(b) 15 per cent. of the gross amount of the interest in all other cases.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. The term interest shall not include any item which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10 of this Convention.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount that would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The provisions of this Article shall not apply if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.<BR><BR>

ROYALTIES</CENTER>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) 5 per cent. of the gross amount of the royalties for the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment;<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount that would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The provisions of this Article shall not apply if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the rights in respect of which the royalties are paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.<BR><BR>

<UL>
(a) a resident of Chile, obtaining income which has, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, been subject to taxation in the United Kingdom, may credit the tax so paid against any Chilean tax payable in respect of the same income, subject to the applicable provisions of the law of Chile. This paragraph shall apply to all income referred to in this Convention;<BR><BR>
(b) where, in accordance with any provision of this Convention, income derived by a resident of Chile is exempt from tax in Chile, Chile may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on other income, take into account the exempted income.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) Chilean tax payable under the laws of Chile and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within Chile (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in Chile on income, profits or gains out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Chilean tax is computed;<BR><BR>
(b) in the case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of Chile to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent. of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any Chilean tax for which credit may be allowed under the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph) the Chilean tax payable in respect of the income, profits or gains out of which such dividend is paid.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2) of this Article, profits, income and capital gains owned by a resident of a Contracting State that may be taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in that other State.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention.<BR><BR>

Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes covered by this Convention. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.<BR><BR>

</UL><P>
I have the honour to refer to the Convention between the Government of the Republic of Chile and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains which has been signed today and to make on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Chile the following proposals:<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>In General</I></B><BR>
It is understood that the two Governments shall, through the competent authorities, consult together regarding the terms, operation and application of the Convention to ensure that it continues to serve the purposes of avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion and shall, where they consider it appropriate, conclude Protocols to amend the Convention.<BR><BR>
Either Government may at any time request consultations, to be conducted by the competent authorities in an expeditious manner on matters relating to the terms, operation and application of the Convention which it considers require urgent resolution.<BR><BR>
It is agreed that if, after the date on which the Convention enters into force, either Contracting State introduces a tax on capital under its domestic law, the Contracting States will enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a Protocol to amend the Convention by extending its scope to include any tax on capital so introduced.<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>With reference to paragraph (3) of Article 5 (Permanent Establishment)</I></B><BR>
For the purposes of preventing misuse of Articles 5 and 7, in determining the duration of activities under this paragraph, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise (other than enterprises of that Contracting State) may be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons.<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>With reference to paragraph (7) of Article 5 (Permanent Establishment)</I></B><BR>
It is understood that where the commercial or financial conditions made or imposed between the broker or agent and the enterprise differ from those which would be made between independent persons, such broker or agent will not be considered an agent of independent status within the meaning of paragraph (7) of Article 5.<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>With reference to Article 7 (Business Profits)</I></B><BR>
It is understood that the provisions of paragraph (3) of the Article shall apply only if the expenses can be attributed to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of the tax legislation of the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>With reference to paragraph (2) of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises)</I></B><BR>

" 
I have the honour to refer to the Convention between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains which has been signed today and to make on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Chile the following proposals:<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>In General</I></B><BR>
It is understood that the two Governments shall, through the competent authorities, consult together regarding the terms, operation and application of the Convention to ensure that it continues to serve the purposes of avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion and shall, where they consider it appropriate, conclude Protocols to amend the Convention.<BR><BR>
Either Government may at any time request consultations, to be conducted by the competent authorities in an expeditious manner on matters relating to the terms, operation and application of the Convention which it considers require urgent resolution.<BR><BR>
It is agreed that if, after the date on which the Convention enters into force, either Contracting State introduces a tax on capital under its domestic law, the Contracting States will enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a Protocol to amend the Convention by extending its scope to include any tax on capital so introduced.<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>With reference to paragraph (3) of Article 5 (Permanent Establishment)</I></B><BR>
For the purposes of preventing misuse of Articles 5 and 7, in determining the duration of activities under this paragraph, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise (other than enterprises of that Contracting State) may be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons.<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>With reference to paragraph (7) of Article 5 (Permanent Establishment)</I></B><BR>
It is understood that where the commercial or financial conditions made or imposed between the broker or agent and the enterprise differ from those which would be made between independent persons, such broker or agent will not be considered an agent of independent status within the meaning of paragraph (7) of Article 5.<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>With reference to Article 7 (Business Profits)</I></B><BR>
It is understood that the provisions of paragraph (3) of the Article shall apply only if the expenses can be attributed to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of the tax legislation of the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.<BR><BR>
<B>
<I>With reference to paragraph (2) of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises)</I></B><BR>
It is understood that the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 9 are not to be construed as requiring a Contracting State to make any adjustment to the amount of profits charged to tax in that State unless it is satisfied that the action taken by the other Contracting State under paragraph (1) of the Article is justified both in principle and as regards the amount of any adjustment to profits made by that other State.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
A Convention dealing with the avoidance of double taxation and fiscal evasion between the United Kingdom and Chile ("the Convention") is set out in Part I of the Schedule to this Order.<BR><BR>
Article 1 of the Order provides for its citation.<BR><BR>
Article 2 makes a declaration as to the effect and content of the arrangements set out in the Convention contained in Part I of the Schedule to the Order and in the Exchange of Notes constituting an Agreement set out in Part II of that Schedule, and that it is expedient that those arrangements should have effect.<BR><BR>
The Convention provides for business profits not arising through a permanent establishment to be taxed only in the country of the taxpayer's residence. Profits attributable to a permanent establishment may be taxed in the country in which the permanent establishment is situated (Articles 5 and 7).<BR><BR>
Income from immovable property and gains derived from the alienation of such property may be taxed in the country in which the property is situated (Articles 6 and 13).<BR><BR>
Profits and gains from international shipping and air transport are generally to be taxed only in the residence state of the enterprise (operator) (Articles 8 and 13).<BR><BR>
The Convention includes rules for determining taxable profits when a company in one country is related to a company in the other (Article 9).<BR><BR>
The rate of tax imposed in the country of source on dividends derived and beneficially owned by a resident of the other country shall not, in general, exceed 15 per cent. of the gross amount of the dividends. If the beneficial owner is a company which owns at least 20 per cent. of the voting power in the company paying the dividends, the rate of tax imposed in the country of source shall not exceed 5 per cent. of the gross amount of the dividends (Article 10).<BR><BR>
The rate of tax imposed in the country of source on interest derived by a resident of the other country is not to exceed 15 per cent. of the gross amount flowing to the other country provided the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest. In the case of certain categories of interest the rate of tax imposed in the country of source shall not exceed 5 per cent. of the gross amount of interest (Article 11).<BR><BR>
The rate of tax imposed in the country of source on royalties is limited to 5 per cent. of the gross amount in respect of the use of or right to use industrial, commercial or scientific equipment and 10 per cent. of the gross amount in all other cases, where, in either case, the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties (Article 12).<BR><BR>
Subject to certain specified exceptions, each country may generally tax capital gains in accordance with its domestic law (Article 13).<BR><BR>
The earnings of temporary business visitors and some other individuals are, subject to certain conditions, to be taxed only in the country of the taxpayer's residence (Article 14). Fees received by a resident of one country in his capacity as a director of a company resident in the other country may be taxed in that other country (Article 15). Income derived from the activities of entertainers and sportsmen may be taxed in the country in which those activities are performed (Article 16).<BR><BR>
Pensions are to be taxed only in the country of source. Contributions paid in respect of employment or self-employment by, or on behalf of, an individual who is a resident of one country, or who is temporarily present there, to an approved pension plan in the other country shall, subject to certain conditions, be treated for tax purposes in the same way and subject to the same conditions and limitations as contributions paid to an approved pension plan in the country of residence (Article 17).<BR><BR>
Government service remuneration is normally to be taxed only by the paying Government (Article 18). There are separate provisions for diplomatic or consular officials (Article 25). Certain payments made to visiting students and business apprentices are generally exempt from tax in the country visited (Article 19).<BR><BR>
Other income not specified in the Convention will generally be taxed only by the country of which the beneficial owner is a resident. However, if such income arises in the other country, it may also be taxed in that country (Article 20).<BR><BR>
In general, where income continues to be taxable in both countries, credit is to be given by the country of the taxpayer's residence for tax imposed by the other country (Article 21).<BR><BR>
There are provisions safeguarding nationals and enterprises of one country against discriminatory taxation in the other country (Article 22).<BR><BR>
There are also provisions for consultation to resolve difficulties in the application or interpretation of the Convention (Article 23) and for exchanges of information between the taxation authorities of the two countries (Article 24).<BR><BR>
The Exchange of Notes comprising Part II of the Schedule clarifies the intended interpretation of certain parts of the Convention.<BR><BR>
The Convention will enter into force on the date of the later of the notifications by each country of the completion of its legislative procedures. It will take effect in the United Kingdom in respect of corporation tax from 1st April in the following calendar year; and from 6th April of that year for income tax and capital gains tax. It will take effect in Chile on or after 1st January in the calendar year next following the date on which the Convention enters into force (Article 28). The date of entry into force will, in due course, be published in the <I>London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes</I>.<BR><BR>
