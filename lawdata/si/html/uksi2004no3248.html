</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, with modifications, to recommendations by the Boundary Committee for England, a committee of the Electoral Commission, for electoral changes in the county of Hampshire.<BR><BR>
The modifications concern the names of Bedhampton and Leigh Park, Bordon, Whitehill and Lindford, Bridgemary, Hamble, Petersfield Butser, Petersfield Hangers, South Waterside, and Yateley East, Blackwater and Ancells electoral divisions, and the boundary between Basingstoke North West, and Calleva and Kingsclere electoral divisions.<BR><BR>
The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after the ordinary day of election of councillors in 2005.<BR><BR>
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral divisions of the county and provides for the creation of 75 new electoral divisions. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new electoral divisions.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 and 5 make electoral changes in the parishes of Bishopstoke and Crondall.<BR><BR>
Article 7 obliges the Electoral Registration Officer in each district, borough or city in the county of Hampshire to make any necessary amendments to the electoral register to reflect the new electoral arrangements.<BR><BR>
Article 8 revokes the County of Hampshire (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1981, with the exception of article 5.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new electoral divisions and of the new parish wards of the parish of Bishopstoke are demarcated on the map described in article 2. Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Hampshire County Council and at the principal office of the Electoral Commission at Trevelyan House, Great Peter Street, London SW1P 2HW.<BR><BR>
