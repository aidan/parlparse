<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Section 21 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 requires the Secretary of State to prepare a Fire and Rescue National Framework setting out the priorities and objectives for fire and rescue authorities and providing guidance. Fire and rescue authorities must have regard to the Framework in carrying out their functions.<BR><BR>
The Fire and Rescue National Framework 2004/05 was the first National Framework to be prepared for fire and rescue authorities in England.<BR><BR>
Article 2 of this Order, which applies in relation to fire and rescue authorities in England only, substitutes the 2005/06 Framework for the 2004/05 Framework. The 2005/06 Framework will have effect from 1st April 2005.<BR><BR>
The principal differences are:<BR><BR>
Amendments to refer to the financial year 2005/06. For example, Chapter 7 contains information concerning the Revenue Support Grant that Fire and Rescue Authorities will receive for 2005/06.<BR><BR>
Changes reflecting progress since publication of the 2004/05 National Framework. For example, details of recently announced financial support from government for New Dimension training and to install equipment associated with a programme of Home Fire Risk Checks; an acknowledgement of the repeal of the Fire Services (Appointments and Promotions) (England and Wales) Regulations 2004; and the enactment of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.<BR><BR>
Changes that take account of comments received in response to consultation. For example, more detail on the role of ODPM's Business Change Managers and reference to relevant new guidance such as the Chief Fire Officer Association's protocol on reducing unwanted alarm signals.<BR><BR>
Copies of the 2005/06 Framework may be obtained from ODPM Free Literature, PO Box 236, Wetherby, West Yorkshire LS23 7NB (telephone: 0870 1226 236; fax: 0870 1226 237; email: <a href="MAILTO:odpm@twoten.press.net">odpm@twoten.press.net</a> ). It is also available on the ODPM website: <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/fire">www.odpm.gov.uk/fire</a>.<BR><BR>
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no direct impact on the costs of business, voluntary bodies or the public sector. An assessment was prepared for the relevant constituents of the Framework which did have such an impact.<BR><BR>
