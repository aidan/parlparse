These Regulations apply where a court makes an order under section 53A(3) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 (c. 25) ("the Act") that the Lord Chancellor make a payment in respect of the costs of a person in the proceedings. The Regulations provide for when such an order cannot be made, and when such an order is made, how the costs shall be determined.<BR><BR>
Section 53A(3) of the Act applies where a court is prevented by section 53A(1) of the Act from ordering a justice of the peace or justices' clerk to pay costs in any proceedings in respect of any act or omission in the execution (or purported execution) of his duty as&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
