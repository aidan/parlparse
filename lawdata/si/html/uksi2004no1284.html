This Order confirms the Shipping (Jersey) Law 2002, a copy of which can be viewed on the Jersey Legal Information website: http://www.jerseylegalinfo.je, adopted by the States of Jersey. The Jersey Law repeals provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 which continued to apply to Jersey despite the repeal of the 1894 Act by the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. The Order also provides for the repeal, as regards Jersey, of the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc) Act 1993. The Schedule lists certain Orders in Council consequentially revoked in their application to Jersey.<BR><BR>
