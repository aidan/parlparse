Regulation 3 amends the Poultry Meat, Farmed Game Bird Meat and Rabbit Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995. It provides that, where poultry meat is obtained in circumstances where animal health restrictions apply in connection with any disease to which poultry is susceptible&nbsp;-&nbsp;specifically avian influenza and Newcastle disease&nbsp;-&nbsp;the health mark must be overstamped. Meat which has been overstamped or which has not been produced separately from overstamped meat may not be traded with other EEA States. In addition, meat from a bird which has been vaccinated against Newcastle disease within 30 days of slaughter may not be traded with other EEA States.<BR><BR>

Regulation 4 amends the Meat Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1994. It prohibits the use of overstamped meat in meat products which are to be traded with other EEA States, unless the meat products undergo one of the forms of treatment specified in regulation 4(5) (which amends Part VIII of Schedule 2 to those Regulations). Such meat products must be prepared under veterinary supervision and must be accompanied by a health certificate which confirms that they have been treated in accordance with the Regulations. All meat products are now required to be accompanied during transportation by commercial documentation, in addition to the requirement for a health certificate in specified circumstances.<BR><BR>

All the Regulations amended by these Regulations extend to Great Britain only, but are amended only insofar as they extend to England.<BR><BR>

1990 c. 16. Functions formerly exercisable by "the Ministers" are now exercisable in relation to England by the Secretary of State pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 5 to the Food Standards Act 1999 (c. 28); and paragraphs 12, 21 and 24 of that Schedule amend sections 17(1) and 48 of, and paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 1 to, the 1990 Act. Functions of "the Ministers" so far as exercisable in relation to Wales were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales by the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672) and those functions so far as exercisable in relation to Scotland were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46). Regulation 13(4) of S.I. 2000/656 expressly authorises the Secretary of State to amend existing Regulations made or having effect as if made by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (whether with others or not) under the Food Safety Act 1990.<a href="#n3">back</a><p>
