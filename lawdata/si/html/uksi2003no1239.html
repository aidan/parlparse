This Order amends the Non-Contentious Probate Fees Order (S.I. 1999/688) so that a special fee of £8 is payable on an application for a grant of probate or letters of administration in respect of an estate exempt from inheritance tax by virtue of section 154 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, that is, where the deceased is certified to be a member of the armed forces of the Crown killed on active service. The fee which would be payable but for this Order is £50, and an additional £80 for a personal application.<BR><BR>
This Order applies in respect of deaths occurring on or after 20th March 2003.Where fees at the previous rate have been paid the Order provides for the Lord Chancellor to refund the difference between the fee actually paid and the special fee.<BR><BR>
