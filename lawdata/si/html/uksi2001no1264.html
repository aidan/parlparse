These Regulations make transitional and saving provisions in consequence of the coming into force of Schedule 7 (housing benefit and council tax benefit: revisions and appeals) to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 (c.19) which introduces new arrangements for decision-making in relation to housing benefit and council tax benefit. In particular, they provide for the manner in which matters are to be dealt with on or after 2nd July 2001 which are awaiting determination under the existing arrangements for decision-making immediately before that date.<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose a charge on business.<BR><BR>
