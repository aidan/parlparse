This Order amends the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (West Penwith) Designation Order 1986 ("the principal Order"), which designated an area in West Penwith as an environmentally sensitive area, under the power conferred by section 18 of the Agriculture Act 1986 which now enables the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2078/92 (OJ No. L215, 30.7.92, p. 85) on agricultural production methods compatible with the requirements of protection of the environment and the maintenance of the countryside, as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2772/95 (OJ No. L288, 1.12.95, p. 35) as rectified by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1962/96 (OJ No. L259, 12.10.96, p. 7).<BR><BR>
This Order corrects an error made by the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (West Penwith) Designation (Amendment) Order 1998 (S.I. 1998/1296) in amending the principal Order.<BR><BR>
No regulatory appraisal has been prepared in respect of this Order.<BR><BR>
