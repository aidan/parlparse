These rules amend the Pensions Appeal Tribunals (Scotland) Rules 1981 (as amended by the Pensions Appeal Tribunals (Scotland) (Amendment) Rules 1986) so as to&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) replace the provision for prescribed forms for giving notice of appeal and notice of hearing with a provision that forms for those purposes are to be such as the Lord President of the Court of Session may from time to time approve (<I>rules 3(a)(ii) and (b), 4, 6(a) and 12</I>);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) enable the President of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal ("the President") or a member of the tribunal who has been nominated by the President, on reviewing, before the hearing, the appeal documents, to require further information or evidence, to take the opinion of a medical specialist or other technical expert, or to give a direction on any matter arising (<I>rule 5</I>);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) make fresh provision for an appeal to be heard in the absence of the parties (<I>rules 6(b) and 8</I>) but also for re-hearing appeals so heard in certain circumstances (<I>rules 8 and 9</I>);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) enable a designated person (normally the next of kin or the personal representative of a deceased appellant) to pursue an as yet undecided appeal merely by timeous notification to the Pensions Appeal Office (replacing a requirement that an application be made to the President) (<I>rule 11</I>); and<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) make other, minor, amendments (<I>rules 3(a)(i), 7and 10</I>).<BR><BR>
