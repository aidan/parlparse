This Order revokes the Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) Order 1989 and the Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) (Amendment) Order 1997, which amends the 1989 Order.<BR><BR>
The 1989 Order provided that brewers, and groups of companies including brewers, owning more than two thousand licensed premises had either to dispose of the brewery business or the excess of licensed premises or to release their ties on half the excess by 31st October 1992.<BR><BR>
The 1989 Order provides that brewers and brewery groups owning more than two thousand licensed premises must allow their `tied' premises to sell a draught cask-conditioned beer and, as provided for by the 1997 Order, a bottle-conditioned beer, supplied by someone else and prohibits the imposition of ties relating to non-alcoholic beers, low alcoholic beers and non-beer drinks.<BR><BR>
