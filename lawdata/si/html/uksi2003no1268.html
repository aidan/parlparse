&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) After the close of the hearing, the inspector must make a report in writing to the National Assembly which must include the inspector's findings of fact, conclusions and recommendations or the inspector's reasons for not making any recommendations.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) When making its determination, the National Assembly may disregard any written representations, evidence or other document received after the hearing has closed.<BR><BR>

(b) takes into consideration any new evidence or new matter of fact (not being a matter of National Assembly policy),<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where persons entitled to, and who did, take part in the hearing are notified pursuant to paragraph (4), the National Assembly must give them an opportunity to make written representations to it or (if the National Assembly has taken into consideration any new evidence or new matter of fact, not being a matter of National Assembly policy) to ask for the re-opening of the hearing.<BR><BR>
