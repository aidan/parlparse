The Buying Agency Trading Fund was established with effect from 1st April 1991 under the Government Trading Funds Act 1973 by the Buying Agency Trading Fund Order 1991 (S.I. 1991/875). The name of the Fund was changed to OGCbuying.solutions Trading Fund by the Buying Agency Trading Fund (Amendment) (Change of Name) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/922).<BR><BR>
This Order provides for additional Crown assets (estimated to be £12,100,000) comprising the Whitehall District Heating System and the Whitehall Standby Distribution System and additional liabilities (estimated to be £700,000) comprising creditors and accruals in relation to the additional Crown assets to be appropriated to the Fund.<BR><BR>
The net value of the additional Crown assets will, in accordance with section 2(4) of the Government Trading Funds Act 1973, be added to the originating debt of the Fund and will be treated as having been issued to the Fund by way of loan under section 2B of that Act.
