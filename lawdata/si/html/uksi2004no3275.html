<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends Schedule 19AA to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (c. 1) ("the Schedule") for the purpose of permitting certain assets which are linked assets for the purposes of the overseas life assurance fund of an insurance company to remain treated as solely linked to the overseas life assurance business of the company, notwithstanding that they do not satisfy all of the tests in the Insurance Companies (Overseas Life Assurance Business) (Compliance) Regulations 1995 ("the 1995 Regulations")..<BR><BR>
Article 1 provides for the citation, commencement and effect of the Order.<BR><BR>
Article 2 introduces the amendments.<BR><BR>
Article 3 amends paragraph 5 of the Schedule to provide that, in determining the assets linked solely to overseas life assurance business, the effects of regulations 18 and 19 of the 1995 Regulations are disregarded. By virtue of the amendment paragraph 5 of the Schedule deems assets which would otherwise be deemed (by virtue of those regulations) to be referable to the insurer's basic life assurance and general annuity business to be deemed to be referable to insurer's the overseas life assurance business instead.<BR><BR>
This Order does not impose new costs on business.<BR><BR>
