<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (the Document) to provide for the discretionary payment of recruitment incentives to teachers who have previously taught in schools in the European Economic Area (EEA) but who were not employed to teach on more than 15 days between 30th April 2000 and 31st March 2001 and who return to teach in the maintained sector between 17th April 2001 and 31st December 2001 (or between 17th April 2001 and 28th February 2002 if the teacher has attended a returners' course starting on or after 1st September 2001 for at least six weeks). (<I>Paragraph 46A.2</I>)<BR><BR>
Teachers returning as head teachers or to teach "shortage subjects" may receive £1000 on appointment and a further £3000 if they remain employed in the maintained sector on the anniversary of their taking up the first appointment following continuous service in the maintained sector or at non-maintained special schools.<BR><BR>
Teachers returning to teach other subjects may receive £500 upon appointment and a further £1500 if they remain employed in the maintained sector on the anniversary of their taking up the first appointment following continuous service in the maintained sector or at non-maintained special schools unless within that time they move to a post as a head teacher or to teach shortage subjects in which case they will receive a further £3500. (<I>Paragraphs 46A.3 and 46A.4</I>)<BR><BR>
Teachers returning to teach part-time may receive the relevant initial payment but the further payment, if any, is calculated so as to ensure the total amount paid is proportionate to the proportion of the school week for which they are employed. (<I>Paragraphs 46A.3.4 and 46A.4.4</I>)<BR><BR>
The Order inserts definitions of EEA, EEA Agreement, primary specialist, returners' course and shortage subject to the interpretation paragraph of the Document.<BR><BR>
