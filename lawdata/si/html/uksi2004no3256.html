&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In this regulation&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>

(a) the contract is shown in the company's accounts at cost (which may be nil), and the cost is adjusted for any cumulative amortisation of any premium or other amount falling to be recognised in arriving at the cost of the contract;<BR><BR>
(b) the aggregate of&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) the amount of periodical payments under the contract, or in the case of a swap contract under which only a single payment is to be made, the value of the payment and<BR><BR>
(ii) the credits or debits representing interest arising, on the assumption that an effective interest method is used, in respect of the asset or liability representing a loan relationship which is the hedged item,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
represent the credits or debits that would be given by generally accepted accounting practice in relation to an asset or liability representing a loan relationship whose terms include those of both the hedged item and the interest rate contract;<BR><BR>
(c) exchange gains and losses are recognised as a result of the translation of the contract at the balance-sheet date; and<BR><BR>
(d) profits and losses which arise as a result of the contract coming to an end before its stated date of maturity are amortised and brought into account over the unexpired term of the hedged item.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
<UL>
"an interest rate contract" means&nbsp;-&nbsp;</UL><P>
<UL><UL>
(i) a derivative contract whose underlying subject matter is, or includes, interest rates, or<BR><BR>
(ii) if not falling within paragraph (i), a swap contract in which payments fall to be made by reference to a rate of interest or to an index determined by reference to income or retail prices.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of paragraph 17C(1)(a) of Schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002, there is also prescribed for any period any credits and debits which&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) have for that or any previous period been brought into account in the statement of recognised gains and losses or statement of changes in equity ("equity statements"); and<BR><BR>
(b) represent fair value profits or losses which are transferred in that period from an equity statement&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) to the profit and loss account or income statement, or<BR><BR>
(ii) directly to the carrying value of an asset or liability.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where credits and debits are prescribed by sub-paragraph (5) there is also prescribed, for the purposes of paragraph 17C(1)(a) of Schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002, any debits and credits corresponding to the sub-paragraph (5) credits and debits which are brought into account in the profit and loss account or income statement when&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the hedged item is recognised; or<BR><BR>
(b) a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) This regulation does not apply to any contract to which paragraphs 6,7 or 8 of Schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002[<a name="n14"><a href="#note14">14</A>] applies.<BR><BR>
<B>
Bringing fair value profits or losses into account on currency and commodity contracts</B><BR>

<B>
<a name="10">10.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of paragraph 17C(1)(c) of Schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) there is prescribed the aggregate of the credits and debits representing any fair value profits or losses excluded in relation to a derivative contract of a company by virtue of regulation 7(1) or regulation 8(1); and<BR><BR>
(b) the amount of that aggregate is brought into account for the period in which a termination event occurs.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
This is subject to paragraphs (3), (5), (7) and (8).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In paragraph (1) a "termination event" occurs&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) on the company ceasing to be a party to the contract; or<BR><BR>
(b) if earlier, when the hedged item begins to affect the company's profit or loss.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the forecast transaction or firm commitment which is the hedged item mentioned in regulation 7 or regulation 8 is a forecast transaction of, or a firm commitment to a purchase of, anything the expenditure in relation to which&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) falls to be taken into account in computing the profits of a trade or property business carried on by the company, or<BR><BR>
(b) would fall to be deducted but for any provision of the Corporation Tax Acts prohibiting the deduction of capital expenditure in respect of depreciation of an asset,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
then the aggregate mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) in relation to the contract is to be brought into account in the accounting period in which the expenditure falls or would fall to be deducted.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In paragraph (3) "property business" has the meaning given in paragraph 32(2) of Schedule 29 to the Finance Act 2002[<a name="n15"><a href="#note15">15</A>] (gains and losses of a company from intangible fixed assets).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) part of a contract to which this regulation applies terminates without the company ceasing to be a party to the contract, or<BR><BR>
(b) part only of the hedged item begins to be recognised in determining the company's profit and loss,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
paragraph (1)(b) is to apply to a proportionate amount of the aggregate.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In paragraph (5) "proportionate amount" means that proportion of the relevant aggregate amount which is&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) in a case where it is part of the contract which matures, the amount to which the fair value of the part of the contract maturing bears to the fair value of the whole of the contract at that time, and<BR><BR>
(b) in any other case the proportion which the fair value of the hedged item on which exchange gains and losses begin to be recognised bears to the fair value of the whole of the hedged item at that time.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Where immediately on ceasing to be a party to the contract ("the old contract"), the company enters into another contract ("the new contract") which meets the conditions in regulation 7 or regulation 8 in relation to the same hedged item as was the hedged item in relation to the old contract&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) paragraph (1)(b) shall not apply in relation to the old contract, and<BR><BR>
(b) the aggregate prescribed in paragraph (1)(a) in relation to the old contract shall be treated for the purposes of the application of this regulation to the new contract as included in the aggregate prescribed in relation to the new contract.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Where as a result of the company ("the transferor company") ceasing to be a party to the contract ("the old contract")&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) paragraph 28 of Schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002 applies, and<BR><BR>
(b) the transferee company (within the meaning of paragraph 28 of that Schedule) meets the conditions in regulation 7 or regulation 8 in relation to the contract ("the new contract") and the same hedged item as was the hedged item in relation to the old contract,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
paragraph (9) applies.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Where this paragraph applies&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) paragraph (1)(b) shall not apply in relation to the old contract; and<BR><BR>
(b) the aggregate prescribed in paragraph (1)(a) in relation to the old contract shall be treated for the purposes of the application of this regulation to the new contract as included in the aggregate prescribed in relation to the new contract.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) For the purposes of paragraph 17C(1)(a) of Schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2002, there is also prescribed for any period any credits and debits which&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) have for that or any previous period been brought into account in the statement of recognised gains and losses or statement of changes in equity ("equity statements"); or<BR><BR>
(b) represent fair value profits or losses which are transferred in that period from an equity statement&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) to the profit and loss account or income statement, or<BR><BR>
(ii) directly to the carrying value of an asset or liability.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
</UL><P>
