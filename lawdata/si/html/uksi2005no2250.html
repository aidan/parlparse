<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</b><br/><br/><i>
(This note is not part of the Order)</i></center><br/><br/>
This Order approves Rules of the Nursing and Midwifery Council which provide for an election scheme to elect the registrant and alternate members of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Four registrant members and four alternate members are to be appointed in respect of each of the three parts of the register maintained by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, one of those four being appointed in respect of each national constituency (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).<br/><br/>
Ballots will usually take place by the single transferable voting system, and generally, the first placed candidate in a ballot is to be appointed as the registrant member, and the second placed candidate is to be appointed the alternate member, for the constituency and part of the register in respect of which the ballot is held. However, there are separate arrangements if two or fewer candidates stand. There are also arrangements for the promotion of candidates in the event of a registrant or alternate member later resigning: normally, if a registrant member resigns, her alternate member becomes the registrant member and the third placed candidate in the election in which she was elected becomes the new alternate member, a process which allows for the promotion of a maximum of four unsuccessful candidates in any election.<br/><br/>
The election scheme also contains measures relating to: the appointment of a returning officer and an independent scrutineer; the nominations process; the holding of polls (including arrangements for both postal and electronic voting); and the declaration of results and the subsequent appointment of registrant and alternate members to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The scheme includes special provisions for dealing with issues such as the death or withdrawal of candidates and protests. Provision is also made for re-running elections and holding by-elections, where necessary.<br/><br/>
