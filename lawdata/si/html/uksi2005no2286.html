<b>
Visibility from the Bridge</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<a name="4">4.</b>
&#8212;(1) The steering position of a new ship shall be situated above all decked superstructures other than the wheelhouse (if any) in which it is situated.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subject to regulations 6 and 7, the steering position of a ship shall be so sited and any wheelhouse shall be so constructed &#8211;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) as to provide the helmsman at the steering position with all round visibility, and<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2) &#8211;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) the presence of a blind arc of visibility abaft the beam from the steering position shall not prevent visibility from being all round visibility if the helmsman can, by moving horizontally within the permitted limits, obtain visibility over the whole of that blind arc, and<br/><br/>
(b) "the permitted limits" are &#8211;<br/><br/>
<ul>

</ul><p>
</ul><p>
<b>
Sight lines</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<a name="5">5.</b>
&#8212;(1) In determining whether the requirements of regulation 4 are met, the helmsman shall be assumed to have a height of eye of 1675 mm above the deck at the steering position.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where a sight line, required to be clear to meet the requirements of regulation 4, passes through an after facing window, that window shall be of not less than 450 mm depth (height) centred at 1675 mm above the deck at the steering position.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) No sight line shall pass through any enclosed passenger deck.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In new ships, and where practicable in existing ships, any sight line which passes over an open passenger deck shall be such that it would pass over the heads of any passengers occupying seats on that deck.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Should the activities of standing passengers on an open passenger deck cause a serious obstruction to visibility from the steering position, a dedicated lookout must be provided in accordance with regulation 6(2) in such a manner as to overcome the effects of such obstruction.<br/><br/>
<b>
Dedicated lookout</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<a name="6">6.</b>
&#8212;(1) Where an existing ship &#8211;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) does not comply fully with the requirements of regulation 4(2)(a), or<br/><br/>
(b) does not comply fully with the requirements of regulation 4(2)(b)(ii) and it is not practicable for the ship so to comply,<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
those requirements shall not apply to the ship if a dedicated lookout is provided at all times when the ship is under way.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The dedicated lookout shall &#8211;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) have the sole duty, while the ship is underway, of maintaining a lookout,<br/><br/>
(b) be positioned outside the passenger spaces, and<br/><br/>
(c) be instructed by the master to keep a continuous lookout astern, and in particular over any or all (as the case may be) of the areas referred to in regulation 4(2)(a), (2)(b)(ii) and (3) which the helmsman cannot see.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The dedicated lookout may be in the wheelhouse, but if positioned outside the wheelhouse and remote from the helmsman he shall be provided with a wired telephone communication link to the helmsman.<br/><br/>
<b>
Other lookout arrangements</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<a name="7">7.</b>
The requirements of regulations 4 and 6 do not apply to a ship which is operated with bridge manning levels which include a helmsman and an officer of the watch, if &#8211;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) the helmsman is able to see the water surface at no more than two ship's lengths ahead and has an unobstructed view to 60 degrees on either bow, and<br/><br/>
(b) the officer of the watch is able to obtain all round visibility by horizontal movement within the navigation work area.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
<b>
Windows</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<a name="8">8.</b>
&#8212;(1) Vertical framing between all windows in the wheelhouse of a ship shall be kept to a minimum and shall not be installed immediately forward of the steering position or positions.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The height of the lower edge of the forward facing windows of the wheelhouse shall be as low as practicable.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The upper edge of the forward facing windows of the wheelhouse shall be high enough to allow a person at the steering position with height of eye of 1800 mm a clear forward view to at least 10 degrees above the horizontal at height of eye level.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) On a new ship the wheelhouse windows shall be inclined from the vertical plane, top out, at an angle of not less than 10 degrees and not more than 25 degrees, except in the way of access doors to the wheelhouse.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Neither polarised nor tinted glass shall be used in any wheelhouse window.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) An adequate portion of the forward facing windows serving the helmsman shall be able to be maintained in a clear condition during conditions of spray and precipitation.<br/><br/>
<b>
Exemptions</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<a name="9">9.</b>
&#8212;(1) The Secretary of State may grant exemptions from all or any of the provisions of these Regulations (as may be specified in the exemption) for individual cases or classes of case on such terms (if any) as he may specify if he is satisfied that &#8211;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) compliance with such provision is either impracticable or unreasonable in that case or class of case, and<br/><br/>
(b) the exemption is subject to such conditions and limitations as will provide a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the provision or provisions from which exemption is being granted.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Secretary of State may, on giving reasonable notice, alter or cancel any exemption granted under paragraph (1).<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) An exemption, and an alteration or cancellation of an exemption, shall be given in writing and shall specify the date on which it takes effect and the conditions (if any) on which it is given.<br/><br/>
<b>
Penalties</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<a name="10">10.</b>
&#8212;(1) If a ship to which these Regulations apply proceeds, or attempts to proceed, on any voyage without complying with the requirements of these Regulations, the owner and master shall each be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where a ship is managed by a person other than its owner (whether on behalf of the owner or some other person or on his own behalf) the reference in paragraph (1) to the owner shall be construed as including a reference to that person.<br/><br/>
<b>
Detention</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
<a name="11">11.</b>
In any case where a ship does not comply with the requirements of these Regulations, the ship shall be liable to be detained, and section 284(1) to (6) and (8) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995[<a name="n6"><a href="#note6">6</a>] (which relates to detention of a ship) shall have effect in relation to that ship as if for "this Act", wherever it appears, there were substituted "the Merchant Shipping (Bridge Visibility) (Small Passenger Ships) Regulations 2005".<br/><br/>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</b><br/><br/><i>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</i></center><br/><br/>
These Regulations apply to passenger ships under 45 metres in length which are engaged in voyages as described in regulation 3(1). The Regulations implement the recommendations of the Marine Accident Investigation Branch on bridge visibility on passenger ships set out in their Report into the loss of "the Marchioness". The provision contained in these Regulations was previously contained in the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ships of Classes IV, V, VI and VI(A) (Bridge Visibility) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992/2357), which were repealed by the Merchant Shipping (Safety of Navigation) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/1473) ("the 2002 Regulations"). The 2002 Regulations make provision for bridge visibility for ships of 45 metres in length and above in accordance with the requirements of the SOLAS Convention, but do not make provision for ships below that length.<br/><br/>
These Regulations require ships to be so constructed that the helmsman has good visibility over an arc of 360 degrees of the horizontal plane. Where existing ships cannot fully meet the requirements for all round visibility a dedicated lookout must be posted to cover the area which is obscured from the steering position. Provision is made in the Regulations for exemptions, penalties and detention.<br/><br/>
