</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the Public Interest Disclosure (Prescribed Persons) Order 1999 by adding the Independent Police Complaints Commission to the list of prescribed persons in that Order. It also specifies the descriptions of matters in respect of which the Commission is prescribed.<BR><BR>
The effect of this is that under Part IV A of the Employment Rights Act 1996 a worker will be protected from being subjected to any detriment if he makes a qualifying disclosure in good faith to the Commission, reasonably believing that the failure disclosed falls within the matters in respect of which the Commission is prescribed and that the information disclosed, and any allegation in it, are substantially true.<BR><BR>
