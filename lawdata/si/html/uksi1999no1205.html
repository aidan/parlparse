These Regulations amend the 1993 Regulations so as to apply them to parking adjudicators when acting as traffic adjudicators pursuant to Part II (bus lanes) of the London Local Authorities Act 1996 and to make consequential modifications.<BR><BR>
Regulations 7 and 8 make minor drafting amendments to regulations 9(7) and 11(1)(d) of the 1993 Regulations.<BR><BR>
