Whereas in pursuance of tariffs approved under the Eurocontrol Convention[<a name="n1"><a href="#note1">1</A>] and under the Multilateral Agreement relating to Route Charges concluded at Brussels on 12th February 1981[<a name="n2"><a href="#note2">2</A>] (being international agreements to which the United Kingdom is a party), the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has determined rates of charges, as specified in the following Regulations, payable to Eurocontrol in respect of navigation services provided for aircraft:<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, therefore, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 73(1)(a) and (6) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982[<a name="n3"><a href="#note3">3</A>] and of all other powers enabling him in that behalf, hereby makes the following Regulations:<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These Regulations may be cited as the Civil Aviation (Route Charges for Navigation Services) (Fourth Amendment) Regulations 1999 and shall come into force on 1st September 1999.<BR><BR>

These Regulations further amend the Civil Aviation (Route Charges for Navigation Services) Regulations 1997 (the "principal Regulations") as follows:<BR><BR>
The unit rates in euros which are set out in column (3) of Schedule 2 of the principal Regulations are increased in the case of Austria from 54.36 to 75.24, in the case of Croatia from 47.69 to 58.33 and in the case of the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia from 50.38 to 58.30. The unit rates in euros are decreased in the case of Slovakia from 71 to 28.99.<BR><BR>
The unit rates in euros set out in Schedule 2 of the principal Regulations are calculated by reference to the costs of provision of en-route navigation services in the participating countries in the Eurocontrol charges system, the amount of traffic using each country's airspace and the relationship of each country's currency to the euro over a period agreed by Ministers of the participating countries. The interaction of these elements varies in each country.<BR><BR>
The United Kingdom Air Pilot and the foreign Aeronautical Information Publications referred to in the principal Regulations can be purchased from Westward Digital Limited, 37 Windsor Street, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire GL52 2DG and can be inspected at major aerodromes in the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>
