&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) Where an allegation has been referred to the Committee under section 20 of the Act or by the Professional Conduct Committee by virtue of rules under section 26(2)(a) of the Act, the Committee shall meet as soon as practicable thereafter to consider whether in its view a hearing is desirable to deal with the allegation, for which purpose it shall consider the nature of the allegation and any observations (or admissions) given by the respondent to the Investigating Committee and, in the case of a reference from the Professional Conduct Committee, any evidence given or submissions made to that Committee.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As soon as practicable after that meeting, the Registrar shall give notice to the respondent, specifying the allegation formulated by the Investigating Committee which has been referred to the Committee and&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) if the Committee has determined to hold a hearing, notifying the date, time and place of the meeting of the Committee which will consider the allegation by way of a hearing; or<BR><BR>

</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the respondent notifies the Registrar under paragraph (2)(b) within the period there mentioned of his wish to have the allegation considered at a hearing, the Registrar shall give a further notice to the respondent notifying him of the date, time and place of the meeting of the Committee which will consider the allegation by way of a hearing.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If the Committee has not determined under paragraph (1) that a hearing is desirable and the respondent has not requested a hearing pursuant to paragraph (2)(b), but the Committee reaches the view during its investigations and deliberations that the matter should nonetheless be the subject of a hearing, it may then require one, and the Registrar shall in that event give notice to the respondent notifying him of the date, time and place of the meeting of the Committee which will consider the allegation by way of a hearing.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A notice given pursuant to paragraph (2)(a), (3) or (4) shall be served before the beginning of the period of 42 days ending with the date of the meeting of the Committee which will consider the allegation by way of a hearing, and shall specify the requirement of Rule 8(3) for the respondent to provide the list, statement and notice there mentioned.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the hearing is so postponed the Registrar shall, as soon as practicable, give notice to the parties concerned of the postponement and of the further date, time and place of the meeting of the Committee at which the allegation will be considered by way of a hearing; and the Registrar shall also notify the person making the allegation of that date, time and place.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The Committee may arrange for the attendance of the author of any report or statement of which the relevant chiropractor has been sent a copy under Rule 15(5) or paragraph (2) above, even if no request is made by the relevant chiropractor under paragraph (5), in order that the author may be questioned by the Committee, and if it does so and the relevant chiropractor has elected to appear before the Committee pursuant to section 23(9) of the Act, the author may also be questioned by him.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The Committee may from time to time adjourn any proceedings before it at which the relevant chiropractor is to be present, whether to enable attendance of the author of a report or statement under paragraph (5) or (6) or for any other reason; and the relevant chiropractor shall be given reasonable notice by the Registrar of the date, time and place of the resumption of such adjourned proceedings at which he is to be present unless they were announced at the time of adjournment and the relevant chiropractor or his legal representative were then present.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The reports, statements and other documents of which copies must be provided under Rule 15(5) or paragraph (2) above do not include reports, statements and documents of which the relevant chiropractor has already received copies in connection with proceedings under Part III of these Rules or under Rule 17 or which were procured or provided by or on behalf of the relevant chiropractor.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The Committee shall take the advice of a medical assessor appointed under section 28 of the Act to such extent as the Committee thinks is necessary or desirable in discharging its functions under this Part, and it may take the advice of a legal assessor appointed under section 27 of the Act; and it shall secure unless otherwise agreed by the relevant chiropractor or his representative that such a medical assessor and legal assessor are present at any appearance of the relevant chiropractor before the Committee, and any medical or legal assessor may with the leave of the Committee question any witness attending before it.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) If the relevant chiropractor has indicated that he wishes to appear&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the proceedings connected with his appearance shall be in private (save for the relevant chiropractor and his representative, the Registrar, any legal assessor or medical assessor, the person making the allegation to which the conditions of practice order or suspension order in question relates, any witnesses, any staff of the Council and any note-taker), unless the Committee is satisfied that it would be appropriate that the proceedings or any part of them be held in public;<BR><BR>
(b) nothing in this Part shall preclude the Committee deliberating together in the absence of any of the persons mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) (including the relevant chiropractor and any representative) and of the public at any time; and<BR><BR>
(c) if the relevant chiropractor does not appear and the Committee is satisfied that notice has been given to him under Rule 15(4) or (in the case of an adjournment) notice has been given under paragraph (7) or the announcement referred to in that paragraph was made, it may proceed in his absence.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Committee shall not, in considering the allegation and determining the steps to be taken under section 23(2) of the Act, take into account any evidence or other matters relating to issues of fact unless the respondent and the person making the allegation have been given an opportunity to consider and comment on the evidence or other matter.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Subject to paragraph (2), in considering the allegation and determining any step to be taken under section 23(2) of the Act, the Committee may make such inquiry in such manner as it thinks fair and proper; but it shall afford the respondent the opportunity required by subsection (9) of section 23 of the Act in respect of its exercise of its powers under subsection (2) of that section.<BR><BR>
<B>
Notification of decisions</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
18.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) As soon as practicable after the Committee has made its decision on whether an allegation is well founded and as to any steps to be taken under section 23(2) of the Act, whether or not that decision was announced at the conclusion of a hearing under Part III the Committee shall, by notice given by the Registrar, notify&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the respondent of its decision and its reasons for reaching it, and (if the allegation is found to be well founded) of the respondent's right of appear under section 30 of the Act; and<BR><BR>
(b) the person making the allegation of its decision and its reasons for reaching it.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As soon as practicable after the Committee has determined under Part IV the steps that it is to take under section 23(4), (5) or (6) of the Act (including any decision not to take a step after application under section 23(6) of the Act) the Committee shall, by notice given by the Registrar, notify the chiropractor to whom the decision relates of its decisions and its reasons for reaching it, and (so far as relevant) of his right of appeal under section 30 of the Act.<BR><BR>
<B>
Voting</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
19.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) The Committee shall vote on any matter to be determined by the Committee in considering an allegation, or in deciding under Part IV the steps to be taken under section 23(4), (5) or (6) of the Act, by the Chairman of the Committee calling upon members present to signify their votes by raising their hands, and by the Chairman then announcing his own vote (followed by any casting vote as provided for in paragraphs 40(3) and (4) of Schedule 1 to the Act) and declaring to the Committee how the matter has been decided.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any member may challenge any decision so declared, in which event the Chairman shall again announce the motion, and call each member's name in turn, each member on being so called announcing his own vote, being either "yes" or "no" to the motion put, and the Chairman shall vote last, making first his ordinary vote and then (so far as relevant) any casting vote, and then declare the result.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) No member present may abstain.<BR><BR>
<B>
Referral to Professional Conduct Committee</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
20.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) If in the course of the investigation of and its deliberations on an allegation, the Committee is of the view that the allegation would be better dealt with by the Professional Conduct Committee because a substantial issue arises whether the respondent has been guilty of unacceptable professional conduct or of professional incompetence, it may refer the matter to that Committee, and the Professional Conduct Committee shall deal with the matter as if the allegation were to that effect<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The power under paragraph (1) may be exercised notwithstanding that a hearing under Part III has begun, provided that the Committee has not voted on its decision whether the allegation is well founded.<BR><BR>
<B>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any other notice, document or other matter to be given to or served on a person under these Rules may be sent by ordinary post.<BR><BR>
