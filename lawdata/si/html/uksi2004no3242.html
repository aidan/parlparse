<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations, which apply to England, disapply the duties imposed by section 32(1) to (7) of the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003 (requiring the waste disposal and collection authorities of areas where the waste disposal authority is not also a waste collection authority to have a joint municipal waste management strategy) from several categories of waste authorities which comply with specified conditions.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2 sets out these categories. Regulation 3 provides for the duration of the various disapplications.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2(a) refers to an order made under section 99(4) of the Local Government Act 2003. At the time of making these Regulations, the only order which has been made under that subsection is the Local Authorities (Categorisation) (England) Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/1704). Regulation 2(b)(i) and (c) refers to an order under section 4(1) of the Local Government Act 1999. At the time of making these Regulations, the relevant order is the Local Government (Best Value) Performance Indicators and Performance Standards Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/530, as amended by S.I. 2003/864 and article 8 of S.I. 2004/589).<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 modifies the application of section 32(1) to (7) of the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003 so as to restrict the duties in respect of a joint municipal waste management strategy to those waste authorities which do not qualify for a disapplication under regulation 2.<BR><BR>
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no impact on the costs of business.<BR><BR>
