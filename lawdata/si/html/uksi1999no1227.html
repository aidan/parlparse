This Order revokes the byelaws specified in the Schedule to the Order, which were made in exercise of the powers conferred on parish councils by section 8(1)(d) of the Local Government Act 1894 (56 and 57 Vict. c. 73). The relevant part of that section was repealed by section 272(1) of, and Schedule 30 to, the Local Government Act 1972.
