<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
On 1st October 1998 the Scottish College of Textiles will cease to be a separate institution and will become part of Heriot-Watt University. This Order gives effect to that arrangement.<BR><BR>
The Order closes the Scottish College of Textiles and winds up the company, also called Scottish College of Textiles ("the College company"), which conducts the College (Article 3) (this company, as the body corporate conducting the institution, is the governing body of the College in terms of section 56(1) of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992, though the documents constituting the company describe the Governors who manage the affairs of the company as "the governing body").<BR><BR>
The Order transfers the whole property, rights, liabilities and obligations of the College company to Heriot-Watt University (Article 4) and makes consequential provision regarding property provided with the aid of grant (Article 5). It provides for staff of the College to transfer to employment by the University without a break in their employment (Article 6). It dissolves the College company (Article 7). It revokes the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the College company and the Scottish College of Textiles (Scotland) Order of Council 1993 (Article 8) and makes consequential amendments to regulations governing superannuation and compensation for premature retirement to enable the present arrangements to continue to be available for transferred staff (Article 9).<BR><BR>
