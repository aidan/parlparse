</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations revoke and replace the Education (School Hours and Policies) (Information) Regulations 1989 ("the 1989 Regulations") in relation to England.<BR><BR>
Apart from updating statutory references and omitting amendments to earlier (revoked) Regulations, there are no changes of substance from the 1989 Regulations.<BR><BR>
As under the 1989 Regulations, these Regulations impose obligations on head teachers, school governing bodies and local education authorities to make information available about charging and remissions policies.<BR><BR>
The head teacher is required to make available to parents and others details of the school governing body's charging and remissions policies determined under section 457 of the Education Act 1996 and details of the times at which each school session begins and ends. This information is to be available for inspection at the school and parents are entitled to a free copy of it (<I>regulation 3</I>).<BR><BR>
Local education authorities are required to make available details of their charging and remissions policies at specified locations (<I>regulation 4</I>).<BR><BR>
If any change takes place in the governors' charging and remissions policies after the school prospectus has been published but before the governors' report has been completed, they are required to provide details of the change with their report (<I>regulation 5</I>).<BR><BR>
