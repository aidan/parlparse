</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The Order brings into force on 2nd September 2002 in relation to England only section 79(1) of the Care Standards Act 2000 in order to give effect to the following provisions of Part XA of the Children Act 1989. (Part XA was added to the Children Act 1989 by the Care Standards Act 2000):<BR><BR>
<UL>
Section 79P(3) which applies certain provisions relating to the register of nursery education inspectors set out in paragraphs 8, 9, 10 and 11 of Schedule 26 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998[<a name="n3"><a href="#note3">3</A>] to the register of child care inspectors to be maintained by Ofsted under Section 79P(1);</UL><P>
<UL>
Section 79P(4) (a) to (c) which set out modifications to the provisions of Schedule 26 listed in Section 79P(3) that shall apply in relation to the register of child care inspectors.</UL><P>
<UL>
The Care Standards Act 2000 (Commencement Order No. 7 (England) and Transitional, Transitory and Savings Provisions) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/2041) provides that the fourth and final transitional period shall come to an end upon commencement of Sections 79P(3) and (4) of the Children Act 1989. It is no longer necessary to implement 79P(4)(d) which has been superseded by paragraph 5 of Schedule 14 to the Education Act 2002 and will be repealed when that provision is brought into force. It is therefore necessary to provide that the fourth transitional period for the introduction of the changes made to the Children Act 1989 by the Care Standards Act 2000 shall come to an end upon the commencement of 79P(3) and (4)(a) to (c) notwithstanding the fact that not all provisions of section 79P(4) have been brought into force.</UL><P>
All other provisions of Part XA and Schedule 9A have been brought into force or will come into force on 2nd September 2002.<BR><BR>
