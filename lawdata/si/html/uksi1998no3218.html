Whereas a draft of this Order has been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament:<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by section 50(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991[<a name="n1"><a href="#note1">1</A>], and after consultation with the Parole Board in accordance with the said section 50(1), I hereby make the following Order:<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="1">1.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) This Order may be cited as the Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1998.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This Order shall come into force on the expiry of seven days after the day on which it is made.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Any reference in this Order to a section is a reference to a section of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In this Order, "long-term prisoner" has the meaning assigned to it by section 33(5), as extended by section 43(1).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Section 35(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 ("the 1991 Act") provides that after a long-term prisoner has served one-half of his sentence, the Secretary of State may, if recommended to do so by the Parole Board, release him on licence. Section 37(5) of the 1991 Act provides that the Secretary of State shall not include on release, or subsequently insert, a condition in the licence of a long-term prisoner, or vary or cancel any such condition, except after consultation with the Board.<BR><BR>
This Order provides that, in relation to a long-term prisoner who is serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than fifteen years, the above provisions shall have effect subject to the modifications in subsections (2) and (3) of section 50 with the effect that the Secretary of State shall, if recommended to do so by the Board, release such a prisoner on licence who has served half of his sentence. Section 37(5) is modified by section 50(3) with the effect that the Secretary of State shall not include on release, or subsequently insert, a condition in the licence of such a prisoner, or vary or cancel any such condition, except in accordance with the recommendations of the Board.<BR><BR>
This Order revokes the Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1992 (S.I. 1992/1829) which made similar provision to this Order in relation to a long-term prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of less than seven years which was imposed upon him on or after 1st October 1992.<BR><BR>
