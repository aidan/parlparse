These Regulations further amend the Medicines (Pharmacies) (Applications for Registration and Fees) Regulations 1973 ("the principal Regulations "). Regulation 2(a) increases the fees for registration of premises at which a retail pharmacy business is, or is to be, carried on from £135 to £139 and, where the premises are in Northern Ireland, from £73 to £75. Regulation 2(b) increases subsequent annual fees (retention fees) from £87 to £89 and, where the premises are in Northern Ireland, from £68 to £70. Regulation 2(c) increases the penalty for failure to pay retention fees (payable in circumstances specified in section 76(2) of the Medicines Act 1968) from £278 to £286 and, where the premises are in Northern Ireland, from £208 to £213.<BR><BR>
These Regulations also revoke the Medicines (Pharmacies) (Applications for Registration and Fees) Amendment Regulations 1998, which increased the fees in the principal Regulations, the effect of which is spent on the coming into force of these Regulations.<BR><BR>
