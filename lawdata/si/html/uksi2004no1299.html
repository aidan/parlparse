</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order, which applies in Great Britain and in Gibraltar, provides for the expenses of local returning officers at European Parliamentary elections. Local returning officers are defined by section 6(5A) of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 and discharge functions in each local counting area in accordance with regulation 6 of the European Parliamentary Elections Regulations 2004 (the 2004 Regulations).<BR><BR>
Under regulation 15(1) of the 2004 Regulations the entitlement of a local returning officer at a European Parliamentary election to recover his charges in respect of his services or expenses for or in connection with such an election depends upon&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the services or expenses being of a kind specified in an order under that provision,<BR><BR>
(b) the services being properly rendered and the expenses being properly incurred, and<BR><BR>
(c) the charges in respect of them being reasonable.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
Part A of the Schedule to this Order specifies the kinds of services rendered by a local returning officer for or in connection with a European Parliamentary election in respect of which he is entitled to recover his charges, together with the maximum recoverable amounts in respect of those services. Parts B and C of the Schedule specify the kinds of expenses incurred by a local returning officer for or in connection with a European Parliamentary election in respect of which he is entitled to recover his charges, together (in the case of Part B) with the maximum recoverable amounts in respect of those charges.<BR><BR>
Parts A and B of the Schedule to this Order increase the maximum recoverable amounts from those that were specified in the European Parliamentary Elections (Local Returning Officers' Charges) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/1377). That Order is revoked by this Order.<BR><BR>
