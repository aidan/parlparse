<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits) Regulations 1987 so as to provide for cases where a person is sent from a Magistrates' Court to the Crown Court for trial under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2 amends regulation 5 of the 1987 Regulations in relation to the new procedure so as to provide for three new paragraphs:<BR><BR>
Paragraph (6B) provides a maximum Crown Court custody time limit of 182 days less any period previously spent in the custody of a magistrates' court for the relevant offence.<BR><BR>
Paragraph (6C) provides for the maximum Crown Court custody time limit which will apply where a bill of indictment is preferred under section 2(2)(b) of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 which does not contain a count charging an offence for which that person was not sent for trial.<BR><BR>
Paragraph (6D) specifies the maximum Crown Court custody time limit which will apply where a person has been sent for trial under the new procedure and the indictment preferred against him (not being a bill preferred under section 2(2)(b) of the 1933 Act) contains a count charging him with an offence other than the one for which he was sent for trial.<BR><BR>
