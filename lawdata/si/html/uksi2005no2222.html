&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In section 44 (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 4&#8212;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) in subsection (1) for the words "land is acquired or taken" there shall be substituted the words "a right over land is purchased"; and<br/><br/>

<b>
3.</b>
&#8212;(1) The 1965 Act shall have effect with the modifications necessary to make it apply to the compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as it applies to the compulsory acquisition under this Order of land, so that, in appropriate contexts, references in that Act to land are read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including reference to&#8212;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) the right acquired or to be acquired; or<br/><br/>
(b) the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable.<br/><br/>

<ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"
<b>
7.</b>
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard shall be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of his, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act."<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ul>
(a) a question of disputed compensation in respect of the purchase of a right would apart from this section fall to be determined by the Lands Tribunal ("the tribunal"), and<br/><br/>
(b) before the tribunal has determined that question the person satisfies the tribunal that he has an interest which he is able and willing to sell in the whole of the relevant land, and&#8212;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(i) where the land consists of a house, building or manufactory, that the right cannot be purchased without detriment to that land, or<br/><br/>
(ii) where the land consists of such a park or garden, that the right cannot be purchased without seriously affecting the amenity or convenience of the house to which that land belongs,<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
the River Tyne (Tunnels) Order 2005 ("the Order") shall, in relation to that person cease to authorise the purchase of the right and be deemed to authorise the purchase of that person's interest in the whole of the relevant land including, where the land consists of such park or garden, the house to which it belongs, and the notice shall be deemed to have been served in respect of that interest on such date as the tribunal directs.<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any question as to the extent of the land in which the Order is deemed to authorise the purchase of an interest by virtue of subsection (1) of this section shall be determined by the tribunal.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where in consequence of a determination of the tribunal that it is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1) of this section the Order is deemed by virtue of that subsection to authorise the purchase of an interest in land, the acquiring authority may, at any time within the period of six weeks beginning with the date of the determination, withdraw the notice to treat in consequence of which the determination was made; but nothing in this subsection prejudices any other power of the authority to withdraw the notice.".<br/><br/>

(d) paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),<br/><br/>
</ul><p>
shall be so modified as to secure that, as against persons with interest in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
7.</b>
Section 11 of the 1965 Act (powers of entry) shall be so modified as to secure that, from the date on which the acquiring authority have served notice to treat in respect of any right, they have power exercisable in the like circumstances and subject to the like conditions, to enter for the purposes of exercising that right (which shall be deemed for this purpose to have been created on the date of service of the notice); and sections 12 (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act shall be modified correspondingly.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
8.</b>
Section 20 of the 1965 Act (protection for interests of tenants at will etc.) shall apply with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
9.</b>
Section 22 of the 1965 Act (protection of acquiring authority's possession where by inadvertence an estate, right or interest has not been got in) shall be so modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.<br/><br/>

(b) A tidal work shall be so constructed and thereafter maintained as to ensure that the traffic on the river is not interfered with except with the written approval of the Port Authority (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld but may be given subject to reasonable conditions) and in any event no more than is reasonably necessary for the construction or maintenance of a tidal work; and, subject to the foregoing, that at all times during construction of the tidal works an unobstructed main navigation channel within the tunnel area for the safe passage of vessels is maintained and kept dredged by the undertaker to such depth as the Port Authority may reasonably require and to a width of not less than 60 metres.<br/><br/>

30.</b>
The Port Authority shall not be liable, in the absence of negligence or breach of any duty hereunder or otherwise, for any damage or injury howsoever caused to the new tunnel or to any of the authorised works (whether temporary or permanent) resulting from the dredging operations of the Port Authority or the carrying out by them in the execution of their statutory powers and duties of any operations in the river or works for the improvement or maintenance thereof; and it shall be a defence to any proceedings for an offence under article 38 of this Order arising from the carrying out of such dredging or other operations or works by the Port Authority that the same were reasonably necessary and carried out without negligence.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>
31.</b>
After the purpose of any temporary tidal work has been accomplished or after a reasonable period of notice in writing from the Port Authority requiring it so to do, the undertaker shall with all reasonable dispatch, remove that work or any materials relating thereto which may have been placed below the level of high water by or on behalf of the undertaker and, on its failing so to do within a reasonable period after receiving such notice, the Port Authority may remove the same and charge the undertaker with the reasonable expense of so doing, which expense the undertaker shall repay to the Port Authority.<br/><br/>

32.</b>
If during the construction of a tidal work or within 10 years after the completion of that work and as a consequence whether in whole or in part of its construction, there is caused or created an accumulation or erosion, the undertaker, if so requested by the Port Authority before or within the period of 10 years after such completion, shall remedy such accumulation or erosion in the manner specified in paragraph 34 and, if it refuses or fails so to do, the Port Authority may themselves cause the work to be done and may recover the reasonable cost thereof from the undertaker to the extent that the same is attributable to such construction as aforesaid.<br/><br/>

<b>
33.</b>
Should any such accumulation or erosion as is mentioned in paragraph 32 arise within the period of 10 years mentioned in that paragraph and be remedied in accordance with paragraph 34, any recurrence of such accumulation or erosion shall from time to time be so remedied by the undertaker during that period of 10 years and at any time thereafter, save that the undertaker's obligation under this paragraph shall cease in the event that following the remedying of any accumulation or erosion a period of 10 years elapses from the completion of that remedying, without any further accumulation or erosion being caused or created in consequence of such construction or exercise.<br/><br/>

34.</b>
For the purpose of paragraphs 32 and 33&#8212;<br/><br/>
<ul>

36.</b>

38.</b>
Nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall impose any liability on the undertaker to the extent that any losses, costs, charges, damages, expenses, claims or demands of the Port Authority or for which the Port Authority may be liable above are attributable to negligence or breach of statutory duty on the part of the Port Authority or any act or omission by it of any person in their employ or of their contractors or agents.<br/><br/>

The Port Authority shall give to the undertaker notice of any claim or demand in relation to which the undertaker may be liable under this Part of this Schedule and no settlement or compromise of any such claim or demand shall be made without the consent in writing of the undertaker which if it withholds such consent shall have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.<br/><br/>

Save as the terms of this Order may otherwise provide nothing in this Order shall affect prejudicially any statutory or other rights, powers or privileges vested in, or enjoyed by, the Port Authority or the harbour master at the date of making of this Order but so that it shall not be necessary for the undertaker to obtain any other consent from the Port Authority unless this Part of this Schedule so provides.<br/><br/>
