</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Sections 14-19 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 contain provisions relating to intervention by the local education authorities and the Secretary of State in maintained schools which are causing concern.<BR><BR>
The 1998 Act defines maintained schools by reference to the new categories into which schools will be divided on or after "the appointed day" (defined in section 20(7) of the Act). The appointed day is 1st September 1999. These Regulations modify references in sections 14 to 19 to maintained schools so that, until that day, they will be construed as references to the categories of schools set out in the Education Act 1996, and modify various references to other provisions of the 1998 Act so that they refer to the appropriate provisions of the 1996 Act.<BR><BR>
In the case of grant maintained schools, references to the Funding Agency for Schools, which currently has the responsibility for funding such schools, are also inserted. As the Funding Agency for Schools is to be wound up with effect from 1st April 1999, and its functions transferred to local education authorities, these modifications only apply until that date.<BR><BR>
