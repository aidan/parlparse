<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Act of Sederunt makes amendments to the Rules of the Court of Session 1994. The amendments are mainly consequential upon Orders in Council under sections 40 and 43 of the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995, but paragraph 2(7)(b) and (c) corrects an omission and an error in rule 76.4; paragraph 2(7)(d) makes provision for intimation of an interlocutor making a restraint order to certain persons not affected by that order; and paragraph 2(7)(e) makes new provision both as part of the consequential amendments and in relation to rule 76.4 as it already applied.<BR><BR>
The Orders in Council are the Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime (Designated Countries and Territories) (Scotland) Order 1999 in relation to external confiscation orders of courts in designated countries or territories and the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas Forfeiture Orders) (Scotland) Order 1999 in relation to external forfeiture orders of such courts and in both cases, in relation to proceedings in those countries or territories which may result in such orders of such courts being made.<BR><BR>
