You have been given a <B>notice of decision</B>; you have, or a member of your family has, a right to appeal that decision to an adjudicator. Under section 74 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 I must also give you this <B> one-stop notice</B>.

</TR></TABLE>
<BR>
*<sup>(1)</sup>If your right of appeal is to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission the period is only <B>5 working days</B>.<BR><BR><B>
Additional grounds</B><BR>
The <B>notice of decision</B> takes into account the reasons you gave for wishing to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. <I>You are now required to state any reasons you think you have or may have for staying in the United Kingdom which you have not previously disclosed: these will be your </I>"<I> additional grounds</I>". The decision will be reviewed in the light of what you say. It is in your own interest to now disclose all your grounds for staying in the United Kingdom. But you should not make false claims: do not, for example, apply for asylum unless you have genuine reasons for believing that you qualify in the terms of the 1951 Convention.<BR><BR>
<B>Section 74(7) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 says that, if you wish to claim asylum, you must do so in your statement. And if you wish to claim that in taking a decision your human rights have been breached, you must give notice of your claim in your statement.</B><BR><BR>
<B>
Your statement</B><BR>
You must use the form <B>STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS</B> which accompanies this notice.<BR><BR>
The form must be:<BR><BR>
<li> completed in English<BR><BR>
<li> completed in full<BR><BR>
<li> signed by yourself or your representative if you have one<BR><BR>
<li> returned as instructed below so as to arrive within 10 working days of when you or your representative received it. Saturdays, Sundays, bank and public holidays are not included when counting the 10 days.*<sup>(2)</sup>
<BR><BR>
*<sup>(2)</sup>If your right of appeal is to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission the period is only <B>5 working days</B>.<BR><BR><B>
Consequences of failure to disclose additional grounds</B><BR>
The purpose of this procedure is to make sure that there is no unnecessary delay in dealing with your case. Where you have a right of appeal already, it is important that the adjudicator should be able to deal with all the aspects of your case which he is entitled to consider on one single occasion. If you believe you qualify to stay in the United Kingdom, then it is clearly of benefit to you to have a final and comprehensive decision as quickly as possible.<BR><BR>
If you raise additional grounds after the period allowed, you may lose the chance to have any decision on them reviewed by an independent adjudicator. It may be concluded that they were put forward late to delay your removal from the United Kingdom or the removal of a member of your family. Even if you still have an opportunity to appeal, the appeal may be limited and the fact that you had not disclosed your grounds when required to do so would not be in your favour.<BR><BR>
There are safeguards for exceptional circumstances: for example if you only become aware of a reason for staying in the United Kingdom when it is too late or if you can give a reasonable excuse for not mentioning additional grounds when asked to do so.<BR><BR>
<TABLE border=1 width=100% cellpadding=4>
<TR valign=top>
<TD>
<I>
<B>The consequences of raising additional grounds late may be serious: you should always disclose your reasons for wishing to stay here and any change of circumstances without delay.</B></I>
</TD>
</TR></TABLE>
<BR>
<B>
Your right to appeal the decision</B><BR>
<I>If you do not now have a right of appeal this paragraph does not apply to you</I>. The <B>notice of decision</B> tells you if you can appeal the decision. If you do have a right of appeal, a <B>notice of appeal </B> form will be attached to the <B>statement of additional grounds</B>.<BR><BR>
<li> If you do not agree with the reasons given for my decision in the <B> notice of decision</B>, then you should explain why in your <B>notice of appeal</B>. What you say there is your "<B>grounds of appeal</B>". The <B>statement of additional grounds</B> is for matters unrelated to those which have already been considered.<BR><BR>
<li> If you make a valid <B>appeal </B>and if the <B>decision </B>is maintained in the light of your <B>additional grounds</B>, those grounds will form part of your appeal so long as they could have done so if you had disclosed them earlier. In that case you will be told why your additional grounds were not acceptable and given the chance to add to your <B>grounds of appeal</B> before your papers are sent to the adjudicator. Please do not separate the <B>statement of additional grounds</B> form and the <B> notice of appeal</B> form. There is also a copy of the <B>notice of decision </B> attached to the appeal form: this is for the use of the adjudicator if you appeal, and appeal procedures require you to return it with the appeal form. If you make a photocopy of these papers, or send them by fax, please ensure that all the pages are kept together and in the correct order.<BR><BR>
<li> You may, if you wish, put forward additional grounds without making an appeal. Likewise you should not put forward additional ground with your appeal if you genuinely have none to suggest. But in either case, please return both forms together. If you submit neither an appeal nor additional grounds then you should comply with any instructions to leave the United Kingdom which you have been given.<BR><BR>

<B>To:</B><BR><BR>
You have made a claim for asylum, or a claim that it would be in breach of your human rights for you to be removed from, or required to leave, the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>
You are also one of the following:<BR><BR>
<li> an illegal entrant, <B>or</B><BR><BR>
<li> a person who is liable to be removed as an overstayer under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, <B>or</B><BR><BR>
<li> a person who has arrived in the United Kingdom without leave to enter, an entry clearance, or a current work permit in which you are named.<BR><BR>
Alternatively you have applied for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse or dependant of such a person, or because such a person is dependent on you.<BR><BR>
Under section 75 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 I must give you this <B>one-stop notice</B>. It requires you to state any <B>additional </B> grounds which you have or may have for wishing to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>

<B>
Additional grounds</B><BR>
<I>You are now required to state any reasons you think you have or may have for staying in the United Kingdom which you have not previously disclosed when making your application: these will be your </I>"<I>additional grounds</I>". They will be considered together with the application which you have already made.<BR><BR>
If you are claiming asylum personally you should now put forward any human rights arguments you may have. If you have made a claim based on your own human rights, you should now put forward any reasons you have for thinking that you qualify for asylum. If your overall claim is refused, you will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to an adjudicator. Your appeal would address both issues at once. You should also mention any other reasons you have for wishing to stay here, but you may not be entitled to raise them at an appeal.<BR><BR>
If you are not the person who has made an asylum or human rights claim and their application is refused, your application will also be refused. If you have any reason to think that you have grounds to make an asylum or human rights claim in your own individual right, you should give them now. If your claim is refused, you will have the chance to appeal to an independent adjudicator. You should also mention any other reasons you have for wishing to stay here, but you may not be entitled to raise them at an appeal.<BR><BR>

Your statement</B><BR>
You must use the form <B>STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS</B> which accompanies this notice.<BR><BR>
The form must be:<BR><BR>
<li> completed in English<BR><BR>
<li> completed in full<BR><BR>
<li> signed by yourself or your representative if you have one<BR><BR>
<li> returned as instructed below so as to arrive within 10 working days of when you or your representative received it. Saturdays, Sundays, bank and public holidays are not included when counting the 10 days.<BR><BR>

Consequences of failure to disclose additional grounds</B><BR>
The purpose of this procedure is to make sure that there is no unnecessary delay in dealing with your case. Where you have a right of appeal, it is important that the adjudicator should be able to deal with all the aspects of your case which he is entitled to consider on one single occasion. If you believe you qualify to stay in the United Kingdom, then it is clearly of benefit to you to have a final and comprehensive decision as quickly as possible.<BR><BR>
If you raise additional grounds after the period allowed, you may lose the chance to have any decision on them reviewed by an independent adjudicator. It may be concluded that they were put forward late to delay your removal from the United Kingdom or the removal of a member of your family. Even if you still have an opportunity to appeal, the appeal may be limited and the fact that you had not disclosed your grounds when required to do so would not be in your favour.<BR><BR>
There are safeguards for exceptional circumstances: for example if you only become aware of a reason for staying in the United Kingdom when it is too late or you can give a reasonable excuse for not mentioning additional grounds when asked to do so.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Section 74 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (the Act) provides for the service of a notice on people who have an in-country right of appeal under Part IV of the Act or under the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997. Section 75 of the Act provides for service of a similar notice on various categories of people who claim asylum or claim that it would be contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms for them to be removed from, or required to leave, the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>
Both notices, which are also served on family members, require the recipient to make a statement of any additional grounds which he has or may have for wishing to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. In the case of a section 74 notice, the consequences of stating, or omitting to state, such grounds are set out in sections 73, 76 and 77 of the Act.<BR><BR>
These Regulations set out the procedure for the serving of notices and statements. Apart from the fact that the form of the notice (which is shown in the Schedule to the Regulations) differs according to whether it is a section 74 or section 75 notice, and in some cases the time limit for serving the statement differs, the Regulations make no distinction between section 74 and section 75 of the Act.<BR><BR>
In the case of statements made in accordance with section 75 of the Act, the Regulations also set out how sections 73, 76 and 77 are to apply. References to family members appear in sections 74, 75 and 76 of the Act, and these Regulations provide the requisite definitions.<BR><BR>
