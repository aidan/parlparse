Rule 6(3)(b) of the rules in Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983, as substituted by section 38(2) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, restricts the description that may be used by a candidate in a nomination paper to the forms of words specified in that provision, except where he uses a description authorised by a political party registered under Part II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Rule 4(3)(b) of the rules in Schedule 2 to the Local Elections (Principal Areas) Rules 1986 (as substituted by S.I. 2001/81) makes similar provision in respect of local government elections in England and Wales other than parish or community council elections. As respects the word "Independent", articles 2 and 3 of this Order prescribe a Welsh version of that form of words which may be used as well as or in place of the English version at parliamentary elections and county and county borough council elections in Wales. As respects the words "The Speaker seeking re-election", article 4 prescribes a Welsh version of that form of words that may be used in place of the English version at a parliamentary election in Wales.<BR><BR>
