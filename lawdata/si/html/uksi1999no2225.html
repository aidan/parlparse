<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations give effect in Great Britain to reciprocal arrangements relating to child benefit that have been made between the Secretary of State for Social Security, with the consent of the Treasury, of the one part and the Department of Health and Social Services for Northern Ireland, with the consent of the Department of Finance and Personnel, of the other part.<BR><BR>
These arrangements amend earlier reciprocal arrangements relating to child benefit in order to take into account changes made by the Social Security Act 1998 to the decision-making process for social security and related matters, and to make other minor and consequential amendments.<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose any costs on business.<BR><BR>
