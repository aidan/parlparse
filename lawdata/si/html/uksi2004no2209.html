Section 1 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 provides that there is to be a regional spatial strategy ("RSS") for each region setting out the Secretary of State's policies in relation to the development and use of land within the region. Each region's RSS is reviewed by the regional planning body, which may prepare a draft revision of the RSS for submission to the Secretary of State. On receipt of a draft revision, the Secretary of State may decide that an examination in public should be held into the draft revision. Where he decides to do so, the examination must be held before a person appointed by the Secretary of State.<BR><BR>
These Regulations provide for the remuneration and allowances payable by the Secretary of State to such appointed persons. Regulation 2 provides that the appointed person may be paid £342 for each day he is engaged on which on the examination in public or work connected with it. Regulations 3 and 4, to which the Schedule is relevant, provide the rates of travelling and subsistence allowances payable to the appointed persons.<BR><BR>
