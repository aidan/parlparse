</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Article 2 of this Order brings various provisions of the Environment Act 1995 ("the 1995 Act") into force in respect of Wales on 15th September 2001.<BR><BR>
Article 2(a) brings into force section 57 of the 1995 Act, which inserts a new Part IIA in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 ("the 1990 Act"). Part IIA provides for a regime for the identification and remediation of contaminated land.<BR><BR>
Article 2(b) brings into force section 120(1) of the 1995 Act in so far as it relates to the following paragraphs in Schedule 22&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) paragraph 79, which provides for section 61 of the 1990 Act (duty of waste regulation authorities as respects closed landfills) to cease to have effect;<BR><BR>
(b) paragraph 89, which amends section 79 of the 1990 Act (statutory nuisances and inspections therefor);<BR><BR>
(c) paragraph 91, which provides for section 143 of the 1990 Act (public registers of land which may be contaminated) to cease to have effect; and<BR><BR>
(d) paragraph 92, which amends section 161(4) of the 1990 Act (regulations, orders and directions).<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
Article 2(c) brings into force section 120(3) of the 1995 Act in so far as it relates to the repeal in Schedule 24 of sections 61 and 143 of the 1990 Act.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes saving provision in connection with the commencement of paragraph 89 of Schedule 22 of the 1995 Act.<BR><BR>
The Environment Act 1995 (Commencement and Saving Provision) (Wales) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/2351) (W.191)) was made by the National Assembly for Wales and purported to bring into force the provisions referred to above. The National Assembly for Wales subsequently found it did not have the power to make a commencement order in relation to these provisions. That order therefore had no effect, necessitating the making of the present order.<BR><BR>
