These Regulations further amend the Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 1996. Schedule 1 is amended by the omission of paragraph 1(1)(b), thus removing the limitation on the total number of vehicles which can meet the requirements of paragraph 1 within a period of 5 calendar years, and by the insertion of paragraph 1B which defines a new vehicle class consisting of vehicles to which a new vehicle identification number is assigned by the Secretary of State under regulation 8. Consequential amendments are made to other provisions of the 1996 Regulations.<BR><BR>
