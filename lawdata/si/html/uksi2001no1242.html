<UL>
(a) accept the standard value; or<BR><BR>

</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Liability for the costs of the arbitrator shall be determined by the arbitrator.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Once the value of the animal has been determined in accordance with paragraph 4, nothing in this article shall authorise any delay in the slaughtering of animals pursuant to the powers of the Minister under section 31 of, and Schedule 3(1) to, the Animal Health Act 1981.<BR><BR>
