The amendments follow the establishment of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (the Service) by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 (c.43).

In proceedings under section 41 of the Children Act 1989 (c.41) and section 65 of the Adoption Act 1976 (c.36) the term "children's guardian" replaces "guardian ad litem".<BR><BR>
