This Order amends The General Teaching Council for England (Additional Functions) Order 2000. It provides for the General Teaching Council for England to record information relating to whether a teacher has passed the performance threshold, the date upon which he did so and the school at which he was teaching when he did so. Information relating to whether or not the teacher has passed the national numeracy test and the number of attempts he has made at the test is to be recorded only in the case of teachers achieving Qualified Teacher Status between 1 May 2000 and 30 April 2001 who have not yet completed an induction period. It also provides for the recording of any disciplinary orders made against the teacher by the General Teaching Council of England or the General Teaching Council for Wales. Reprimands issued by either of the Councils are only to be recorded against the name of the teacher for a period of 2 years from the date the reprimand is issued.<BR><BR>
