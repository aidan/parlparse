These Regulations give effect to European Parliament and Council Directive 2003/11/EC and Commission Directive 2004/98/EC on pentabromodiphenyl ether and octabromodiphenyl ether. These Directives make amendments to Council Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations. These Regulations revoke and replace the Controls On Pentabromodiphenyl Ether And Octabromodiphenyl Ether Regulations 2004 (S.I 2004/371) which previously gave effect to Directive 2003/11EC. These Regulations extend to Great Britain and come into force on 1st January 2005.<BR><BR>

Regulation 4(1)(c) prohibits the placing on the market of any articles which include any flame retardant parts which contain pentabromodiphenyl ether in concentrations higher than 0.1% by mass.
