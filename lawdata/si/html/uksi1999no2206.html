(This note is not part of the order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This order establishes, under section 22 of the Petroleum Act 1987, safety zones having a radius of 500 metres from the specified point, around each installation specified in the Schedule to this order and stationed in waters to which section 21(7) of that Act applies (these include territorial waters and waters in areas designated under section 1(7) of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 (c. 29) <I>(Article 2)</I>).<BR><BR>
Vessels, which for this purpose include hovercraft, submersible apparatus and installations in transit) are prohibited from entering or remaining in a safety zone except with the consent of the Health and Safety Executive or in accordance with regulations made under section 23(1) of the Act (currently the Offshore Installations (Safety Zones) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1331)).<BR><BR>
The order removes the safety zone in respect of South Drilling Centre Buckland Field Block 9/18 by deleting the entry relating to it in Schedule 1 to the Offshore Installations (Safety Zones) Order 1999 <I>(Article 3)</I>, because no installation will now be established within the zone.<BR><BR>
