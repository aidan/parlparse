These Regulations make provision for the holding of local inquiries by adjudicators. They establish a timetable for each procedural step, and provide for exchange of information between interested parties in addition to regulating matters relating to the conduct of the inquiry itself and to the notification of the adjudicator's decision.<BR><BR>
The Regulations also amend the Education (References to Adjudicator) Regulations 1999 to correct an error in those regulations.<BR><BR>
