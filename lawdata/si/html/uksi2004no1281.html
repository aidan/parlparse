</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order revokes a byelaw which was made in exercise of the powers conferred on parish councils by section 8(1)(d) of the Local Government Act 1894 (56 and 57 Vict. c.73). The relevant part of that section was repealed by section 272(1) of, and Schedule 30 to, the Local Government Act 1972. The byelaw continued in force notwithstanding the repeal, by virtue of section 262(1) of the 1972 Act. The byelaw is revoked as being substantially superseded by an order making provisions as to the use of parking places, which was made by South Lakeland District Council under section 35 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.<BR><BR>
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as it has no impact on the costs of businesses, charities or voluntary bodies.<BR><BR>
