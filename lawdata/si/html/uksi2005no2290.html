</b><br/><br/><i>
(This note is not part of the Order)</i></center><br/><br/>
The Transport (Guided Systems) Order 1992 specifies certain systems of guided transport for the purposes of Chapter I of Part II of the Transport and Works Act 1992. It accordingly has the effect of applying to those systems the provisions of that Act which introduce offences involving drink and drugs.<br/><br/>
This Order amends the Transport (Guided Systems) Order 1992. The principal amendments provide for&#8212;<br/><br/>
<ul>
(a) removing a guided transport system at Gatwick Airport (which has been closed down),<br/><br/>
(b) amending the description of a guided transport system at Stansted Airport to include its extension to satellite 2,<br/><br/>
(c) substituting a new guided transport system and amending the description of the termini at Birmingham International Airport, and<br/><br/>
(d) revising the reference to Birmingham International railway station and Birmingham International Airport to reflect the significant developments that have taken place at the location of both termini.<br/><br/>
