(b) against the parking authority where he considers that the disputed decision was wholly unreasonable.<BR><BR>

These Regulations prescribe the procedure to be followed in relation to appeals before parking adjudicators against decisions of the parking authority under a decriminalised parking regime in the City of Edinburgh. The parking adjudicators are appointed under section 73 of the Road Traffic Act 1991. That section along with other provisions of that Act relating to the decriminalising of certain parking offences is applied with modifications where appropriate to the City of Edinburgh parking area by the Road Traffic (Permitted Parking Area and Special Parking Area) (City of Edinburgh) Designation Order 1998 (S.I. 1998/1539).<BR><BR>
The procedures relate to appeals under section 72 of, and paragraph 5 of Schedule 6 to, the 1991 Act.<BR><BR>
