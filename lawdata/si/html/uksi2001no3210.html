<B>
Failure to take part in an interview</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="11">11.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) A person who&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) has been notified of any interview in accordance with these Regulations;<BR><BR>
(b) fails to take part in that interview; and<BR><BR>
(c) fails to show before the end of five working days following the day on which the interview was to take place, good cause for his failure to take part in the interview,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
shall, subject to paragraph (12), suffer the consequences set out below.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Those consequences are&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) where the interview arose in connection with a claim for a specified benefit, that the person to whom the claim relates is to be regarded as not having made a claim for a specified benefit;<BR><BR>
(b) where an interview which arose in connection with a claim for a specified benefit was deferred and benefit became payable in accordance with regulation 6(4), that the person's entitlement to that benefit shall terminate as from the first day of the next benefit week following the date the decision was made;<BR><BR>
(c) where the claimant has an award of benefit and the requirement for the interview arose under regulation 4, the claimant's benefit shall be reduced as from the first day of the next benefit week following the day the decision was made, by a sum equal (but subject to paragraphs (3) and (4)) to 20 per cent. of the amount applicable on the date the deduction commences in respect of a single claimant for income support aged not less than 25.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Benefit reduced in accordance with paragraph (2)(c) shall not be reduced below 10 pence per week.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where two or more specified benefits are in payment to a claimant, a deduction made in accordance with this regulation shall be applied, except in a case to which paragraph (5) applies, to the specified benefits in the following order of priority&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) income support;<BR><BR>
(b) incapacity benefit;<BR><BR>
(c) any bereavement benefit;<BR><BR>
(d) invalid care allowance;<BR><BR>
(e) severe disablement allowance.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where the amount of the reduction is greater than some (but not all) of the specified benefits listed in paragraph (4), the reduction shall be made against the first benefit in that list which is the same as, or greater than, the amount of the reduction.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the purpose of determining whether a specified benefit is the same as, or greater than, the amount of the reduction for the purposes of paragraph (5), 10 pence shall be added to the amount of the reduction.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In a case where the whole of the reduction cannot be applied against any one specified benefit because no one benefit is the same as, or greater than, the amount of the reduction, the reduction shall be applied against the first benefit in payment in the list of priorities at paragraph (4) and so on against each benefit in turn until the whole of the reduction is exhausted or, if this is not possible, the whole of the specified benefits are exhausted, subject in each case to 10 pence remaining in payment.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Where the rate of any specified benefit payable to a claimant changes, the rules set out above for a reduction in the benefit payable shall be applied to the new rates and any adjustments to the benefits against which the reductions are made shall take effect from the beginning of the first benefit week to commence for that claimant following the change.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Where a claimant whose benefit has been reduced in accordance with this regulation subsequently takes part in an interview, the reduction shall cease to have effect on the first day of the benefit week in which the requirement to take part in an interview was met.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) For the avoidance of doubt, a person who is regarded as not having made a claim for any benefit because he failed to take part in an interview shall be required to make a new claim in order to establish entitlement to any specified benefit.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) For the purposes of determining the amount of any benefit payable, a claimant shall be treated as receiving the amount of any specified benefit which would have been payable but for a reduction made in accordance with this regulation.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) The consequences set out in this regulation shall not apply in the case of a person who brings new facts to the notice of the officer within one month of the date on which the decision was notified and&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) those facts could not reasonably have been brought to the officer's notice within five working days of the day on which the interview was to take place; and<BR><BR>
(b) those facts show that he had good cause for his failure to take part in the interview.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(13) In paragraphs (2) and (12), the "decision" means the decision that the person failed without good cause to take part in an interview.<BR><BR>

<a name="13">13.</B>
Matters to be taken into account in determining whether a person has shown good cause for his failure to take part in an interview include&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>

(b) that the person was attending a medical or dental appointment, or accompanying a person for whom the claimant has caring responsibilities to such an appointment, and that it would have been unreasonable, in the circumstances, to rearrange the appointment;<BR><BR>
(c) that the person had difficulties with his normal mode of transport and that no reasonable alternative was available;<BR><BR>
(d) that the established customs and practices of the religion to which the person belongs prevented him attending on that day or at that time;<BR><BR>
(e) that the person was attending an interview with an employer with a view to obtaining employment;<BR><BR>
(f) that the person was actually pursuing employment opportunities as a self-employed earner;<BR><BR>
(g) that the person or a dependant of his or a person for whom he provides care suffered an accident, sudden illness or relapse of a chronic condition;<BR><BR>
(h) that he was attending the funeral of a close friend or relative on the day fixed for the interview;<BR><BR>

At the end of regulation 4(d) of the Social Security (Work-focused Interviews for Lone Parents) and Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 2000 (circumstances where requirement to take part in an interview does not apply) there shall be added the words "or under the Social Security (Jobcentre Plus Interviews) Regulations 2001".<BR><BR>
<BR><HR><CENTER><B>
<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations impose a requirement on persons who live in certain areas (regulation 2(2) and Schedule 1) who claim, or are entitled to, certain benefits (specified in regulation 2(1)) to take part in a work-focused interview ("an interview").<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 specifies those persons who are required to take part in an interview when claiming a specified benefit and regulation 4 prescribes when persons are required to take part in an interview as a condition of their continuing entitlement to those benefits.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 specifies that an interview can be deferred and regulation 6 provides that the requirement to take part in an interview can be waived where an interview would not be of assistance to the person or it would not be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Regulation 7 prescribes circumstances when a person is exempted from the requirement to take part in an interview. Regulation 8 specifies when a requirement to take part in two or more interviews is satisfied by the person taking part in a single interview.<BR><BR>
Regulation 9 provides for the person to be advised of the time and place of the interview and provides that an interview can take place in the person's home if the interviewer considers that it would be unreasonable to require that person to attend elsewhere.<BR><BR>
Regulation 10 prescribes circumstances as to when a person is to be regarded as having taken part in an interview and regulation 11 details the consequences of a failure to take part in an interview. Regulation 12 specifies the circumstances where those consequences do not apply and regulation 13 specifies the matters to be taken into account in determining whether a person had good cause for his failure to take part in an interview.<BR><BR>
Regulation 14 provides that a decision that a person has failed to take part in an interview without good cause can be appealed to an appeal tribunal under section 12 of the Social Security Act 1998 (c.14).<BR><BR>
Regulation 15 and Schedule 2 amend the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1968), the Social Security (Work-focused Interviews) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/897) ("the 2000 Regulations") and the Social Security (Work-focused Interviews for Lone Parents) and Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/1926) ("the Lone Parents Regulations").<BR><BR>
In particular, the 2000 Regulations, which impose a requirement to take part in an interview on claimants for certain benefits and on those continuing to be entitled to those benefits in areas not covered by these Regulations, are amended to align the repeat interview requirements in those regulations with those prescribed in these Regulations and to prescribe that only those lone parents residing in specified areas shall be subject to the six month repeat interview requirement. The Lone Parents Regulations do the same in respect of certain lone parents and the amendment ensures that where these Regulations require a lone parent to take part in an interview, any requirement to take part in an interview under the Lone Parents Regulations will not apply.<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose a charge on business.<BR><BR>
An Explanatory Memorandum has been placed in the House Libraries.<BR><BR>
