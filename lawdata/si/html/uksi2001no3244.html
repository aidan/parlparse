Regulation 3 amends regulation 6 of the 1996 Regulations to add the Greater London Authority, functional bodies, the London Pensions Authority and the Greater London Magistrates Courts Authority to the list of bodies required to prepare a statement of accounts.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 inserts a new regulation 6A into the 1996 regulations which specifies requirements for the summary statement of accounts to be prepared by the Greater London Authority.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 amends regulation 7 of the 1996 Regulations to increase the financial threshold above which parish councils are required to prepare income and expenditure accounts from £5000 to £50,000.<BR><BR>
