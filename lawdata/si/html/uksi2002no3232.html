<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Electricity (Connection Charges) Regulations 2002 ("the Principal Regulations").<BR><BR>
The Principal Regulations provide for an electricity distributor to recover an amount in respect of expenses incurred in the initial provision of electric lines and electrical plant to make a connection to premises or a distribution system from a person requiring a subsequent connection which uses those lines and plant. They make particular provision in the case of domestic premises to enable amounts so recovered to be applied in making refunds to persons who have previously been required to make payments in respect of the provision of such lines and plant.<BR><BR>
These Regulations extend the Principal Regulations so that where an initial connection is made on or after 1st June 2003 the possibility of a refund will also apply in the case of non-domestic premises.<BR><BR>
The Principal Regulations provide that an electricity distributor is not obliged to make a refund if the sum refunded would be less than £200. These Regulations increase that figure to £300.<BR><BR>
These Regulations also amend the Principal Regulations to require electricity distributors to maintain records in respect of new connections which are adequate to enable them to meet their obligations under the Principal Regulations.<BR><BR>
