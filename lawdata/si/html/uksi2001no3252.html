<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Section 16 of the Social Security Fraud Act 2001 (c. 11) ("the Fraud Act") amends sections 111A and 112 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c. 5) ("the Administration Act") by substituting new offences relating to failure to notify a change of circumstances affecting entitlement to any benefit, payment or other advantage. A new set of summary or indictable offences is set out in subsections (1A) to (1G) of section 111A and a new set of summary only offences is set out in subsections (1A) to (1F) of section 112.<BR><BR>
For each offence there must be a failure to give prompt notification "in the prescribed manner to the prescribed person". These matters are prescribed in relation to jobseeker's allowance by regulation 3, in relation to housing benefit and council tax benefit by regulation 4, and in relation to any other benefit, payment or advantage by regulation 5.<BR><BR>
The requirements are prescribed only for the purposes of the above-mentioned criminal offences. They mirror existing requirements prescribed for the purposes of claims and payment under sections 5 and 6 of the Administration Act.<BR><BR>
As these Regulations are made within six months of the commencement of section 16 of the Fraud Act, they are exempt by virtue of section 173(5)(a) of the Administration Act from the requirement in section 172(1) of that Act to refer them to the Social Security Advisory Committee.<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose any charge on business.<BR><BR>
