(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Section 10 makes provision for the removal of non-British citizens who have stayed beyond the time for which they were given leave to enter or remain, have breached a condition of their leave to enter or remain or have obtained leave to remain by deception. Non-British citizen family members of such persons may also be removed under section 10. Removal under section 10 is effected by the giving of removal directions, and these Regulations set out the classes of person to whom removal directions may be given and the requirements that the removal directions may make of them.<BR><BR>
The persons who are liable to removal under section 10 were, until 2nd October 2000, liable to be deported. The classes of person to whom removal directions may be given when a deportation order is in force, and the requirements that the removal directions may make of them, are set out in paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971. These Regulations mirror the effect of that provision.<BR><BR>
