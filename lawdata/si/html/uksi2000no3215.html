The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998 ("the 1998 Regulations") came into force on 1st November 1998, and were made under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The 1998 Regulations require all passenger-carrying vehicles (known as "regulated rail vehicles") used on railways, tramways, monorail systems or magnetic levitation systems, which are first brought into use, or belong to a class of vehicle first brought in to use, after 31st December 1998, to meet certain minimum requirements for the benefit of disabled people.<BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the 1998 Regulations so that they also apply to an additional form of guided transport, namely systems which are track-based with side guidance. These Regulations also make the following amendments&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>

other minor changes designed to ensure consistency throughout the Regulations.</UL><P>
