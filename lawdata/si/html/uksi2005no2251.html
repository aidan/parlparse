(This note is not part of the Order)</i></center><br/><br/>
This Order designates certain activities of security operatives for the purposes of section 3 of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 ("the 2001 Act"). Section 3(1) of the 2001 Act makes it an offence to engage in licensable conduct except under and in accordance with a licence granted by the Security Industry Authority.<br/><br/>
Article 2(2)(a) of this Order designates, for the purposes of section 3 of the 2001 Act, the activities of security operatives engaged in manned guarding (as defined in paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act) on licensed premises at or in relation to times when those premises are open to the public (as defined in paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act). Such security operatives are commonly known as door supervisors. Previously, the Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Designated Activities) Order 2004 ("the 2004 Order") only designated the activities of such operatives when they were undertaken on licensed premises in respect of which a justices' on-licence was in force (as defined in paragraph 8(2)(a) of Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act). Article 2(2)(a) of this Order designates those same activities and in addition designates manned guarding activities which take place on other licensed premises listed in paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act.<br/><br/>
Article 2(2)(b) and (c) of this Order designates, for the purposes of section 3 of the 2001 Act, the activities of security operatives engaged in the immobilisation of vehicles (as defined in paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act) and the restriction and removal of vehicles (as defined in paragraph 3A of Schedule 2 to the 2001 Act). These activities were previously designated by the Private Security Industry Act 2001 (Designated Activities) (No. 2) Order 2005 ("the 2005 Order").<br/><br/>
Article 3 of this Order revokes the 2004 Order and the 2005 Order.<br/><br/>
