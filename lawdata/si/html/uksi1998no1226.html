<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends Parts 20 and 21 of Schedule 1 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 ("the 1992 Order"). Those Parts confer permitted development rights in respect of certain telecommunications developments, including the erection of satellite antennas. Where such rights apply, no specific application for planning permission is needed.<BR><BR>
Article 2 amends Class 67 in Part 20 of Schedule 1 of the 1992 Order (Development by telecommunications code system operators). It modifies existing exclusions from such rights to permit in certain circumstances the installation, alteration or replacement of small antennas-<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) on a dwellinghouse or within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse, and<BR><BR>
(b) on a building other than a house.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
At the same time, the telecommunications apparatus which can be installed on a dwellinghouse has been restricted to one small antenna. A small antenna is defined in the interpretation section of Part 20 as an antenna which is used in connection with a telephone system operating on a point to fixed multi-point basis, and which does not exceed 50 centimetres in any linear measurement or have an area exceeding 1,591 square centimetres.<BR><BR>
Article 3 amends Class 68 in Part 21 of Schedule 1 of the 1992 Order (Other telecommunications equipment) by raising the maximum size limit for a satellite antenna on buildings or other structures to 1.3 metres.<BR><BR>
