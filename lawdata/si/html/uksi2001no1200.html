Each licensed supplier shall pay a levy in respect of each qualifying month in accordance with the following provisions of these Regulations.<BR><BR>
<CENTER>
PRESCRIBED PERSON AND METHODS</CENTER>
<BR>
<B>
Collector etc of levy: prescribed person</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="4">4.</B>
The Authority is hereby prescribed as the person to collect payments from licensed suppliers in respect of the levy and to make payments to the nominated person and it shall also collect payments from the nominated person pursuant to section 33(5A) of the Act.<BR><BR>
<B>
Payments in respect of levy etc: prescribed methods</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="5">5.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) The method of calculating the amount of the payment required to be made on a levy payment date by either section 33(5) or 33(5A) of the Act in relation to any qualifying month is as described in this regulation.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The "Amount" is the number which results from applying the formula in paragraph (3) together with any modification to that number which is made pursuant to paragraph (5).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The formula is&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD>
C - A + a - ii + io - x + y + z</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
where&nbsp;-&nbsp;<UL>
"C" is the aggregate payments paid or due to be paid by the nominated person in the relevant period pursuant to or otherwise arising from qualifying arrangements (to the extent not already taken into account in the calculation of the Amount for a previous levy payment date);</UL><P>
<UL>
"A" is the aggregate payments received by the nominated person during the relevant period in relation to sales of electricity or rights relating to electricity generated pursuant to qualifying arrangements;</UL><P>
<UL>
"a" is, subject to pararaph (4), the costs (other than interest) reasonably incurred by the nominated person in relation to the business in the relevant period;</UL><P>
<UL>
"ii" is interest received by the nominated person in the relevant period on any sums held by it in relation to the business;</UL><P>
<UL>
"io" is interest paid by the nominated person in the relevant period on borrowings made by it in order to enable it to conduct the business efficiently provided that the interest rate with reference to which such interest is calculated does not exceed the prescribed interest rate;</UL><P>
<UL>
"x" is zero unless the Authority has determined an amount in accordance with paragraph (6), in which case "x" is that amount;</UL><P>
<UL>
"y" is zero unless an amount is due to be paid on the levy payment date pursuant to regulation 28(5) and (6), in which case "y" is that amount; and</UL><P>
<UL>
"z" is zero unless the Authority has determined any amount in accordance with paragraph (7), in which case "z" is the aggregate of any such amounts.</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The costs of the nominated person may only be included in item "a" above to the extent that those costs in the relevant period when added to the sum included as item "a" in the above calculation in each of the eleven months prior to the relevant period do not exceed the costs cap. Having so calculated, such costs incurred in the relevant period in excess of the costs cap may not be included in "a" in calculations of the Amount in relation to any future levy payment date.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Additions to or subtractions from the number resulting from the application of the formula in paragraph (3) may be made to reflect sums received or paid by the nominated person in relation to the items listed in paragraph (3) in order to correct or update figures given for payments or receipts in relation to those items for any previous qualifying month.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where the Authority reasonably considers that the nominated person has not complied with the debt recovery procedure established in accordance with regulation 5A to a material extent in respect of a debt or debts, it may determine that an amount representing interest on any such outstanding debt or debts may be used as the figure for "x" in the formula in paragraph (3) for the purpose of calculating the Amount in relation to a particular levy payment date.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Where, in relation to any previous levy payment date in calculating the Amount the Authority has determined that "x" should include a figure in connection with a particular debt owing to the nominated person, and the said debt has since been recovered by the nominated person in full, for the purposes of calculating the Amount on the levy payment date following such recovery of the debt the Authority shall determine an amount for inclusion in "z" which is equivalent to the aggregate of any figures included in "x" in relation to that debt in the calculation of the Amount on any previous levy payment date.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Where the Amount is a positive number that number represents the amount which is required to be paid to the nominated person by section 33(5) of the Act in accordance with regulation 28.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Where the Amount is a negative number that number represents the amount which is required to be paid by the nominated person to the prescribed person by section 33(5A) of the Act in accordance with regulation 41.<BR><BR>

and the Authority may also in like manner require the licensed supplier to provide an auditor's certificate that any calculation so furnished is fairly stated and properly compiled.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If, after having regard to any statement furnished under paragraph (4), and to any auditor's certificate provided under that paragraph, the Authority considers that any price charged by the licensed supplier is less than the price which the Authority thinks it would be appropriate to charge for electricity, he shall serve on the licensed supplier a notice under regulation 22.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Fossil Fuel Levy Regulations 1990 ("the Principal Regulations") (S.I. 1990/266). They come into force on being made on 27th March 2001. Any reference in this note to a numbered regulation is a reference to the regulation bearing that number in the Principal Regulations.<BR><BR>
There are a various minor and consequential changes, however the main changes of substance are to adapt the Principal Regulations to the absence of the electricity pool following the introduction of the new electricity trading arrangements on 27th March 2001 and to make provision for payments out of levy to be made to the nominated person (as defined in the Electricity from Non-Fossil Fuel Sources Saving Arrangements Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/2727) instead of to the public electricity suppliers.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 sets out the method of calculating the amounts to be paid to or by the nominated person pursuant to section 33(5) and (5A) of the Electricity Act 1989. This includes provision for the nominated person to be reimbursed its costs which are reasonably incurred in relation to the sale and purchase of electricity which has been generated pursuant to qualifying arrangements. Regulation 5A provides that the Authority is to determine a debt recovery procedure with the aim of ensuring the prompt collection of debts owed to the nominated person.<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 re-expresses the method to be used by the Authority in calculating the rate of levy&nbsp;-&nbsp;the method is now set out in a narrative rather than formulaic manner, with the result that Schedules 1, 2 and 3 have been omitted. The method has also been modified to take into account the absence of the electricity pool and the fact that payments out of levy are to be paid to (or may be received from) the nominated person.<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 also includes a requirement on the Authority to calculate or review the levy rate at least once every 12 months. The Authority no longer has to calculate the rate of the levy with reference to a specific levy year (which previously commenced on 1st October each year). Before notifying licensed suppliers and the nominated person of the levy rate the Authority must consult the Secretary of State.<BR><BR>
Regulations 15 and 19 have been omitted. Regulations 20 and 21 have been amended to remove the concept of supply below market price as this was reliant on the existence of the electricity pool. These regulations now refer to supply below purchase price.<BR><BR>
Regulation 28 has been amended to make provision for payments to be made to the nominated person and for these payments to be made on the fifth banking day of each qualifying month.<BR><BR>
Regulations 33, 37 and the Schedule (which was previously Schedule 4) have been amended to impose information provision and retention requirements on the nominated person.<BR><BR>
The original regulations 41 and 42 have been omitted. New regulation 41 makes provision for payments to be made by the nominated person to the Authority. New regulations 42 and 43 make provision for the correction of over and under-payments made to or by the nominated person.<BR><BR>
Regulation 44 makes transitional provision for the Principal Regulations to be treated as not having been amended by these Regulations in relation to payments to public electricity suppliers where entitlement to those payments accrued to prior to 27th March 2001.<BR><BR>
