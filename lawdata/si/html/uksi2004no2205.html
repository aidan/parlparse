<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Part 2 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 ("the Act") changes the local development planning system in England. These Regulations are made under Schedule 8 to the Act and make transitional arrangements that will apply as the changes are brought into effect.<BR><BR>
The development plans to which the transitional arrangements apply are structure plans, unitary development plans and local plans. The Regulations set out the circumstances in which the Town and Country Planning (Development Plan) (England) Regulations 1999 ("the 1999 Regulations") will continue to apply to development plans that are being prepared when the new development planning system comes into force.<BR><BR>
The detail of the transitional arrangements is set out in the amendments to the 1999 Regulations that are set out in the Schedule to these Regulations.<BR><BR>
The Regulations also contain provisions that have the effect of treating things done before the commencement of Part 2 of the Act as if they had been done after that Part had come into force.<BR><BR>
