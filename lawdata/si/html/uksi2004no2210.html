<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Regulations 1990. Most of the amendments are consequential on amendments and repeals in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. They insert publicity requirements for applications for planning permission for development which the local planning authority think will affect the setting of a listed building, or the character or appearance of a conservation area.<BR><BR>
Different publicity requirements in relation to such applications and applications for listed building consent and conservation area consent apply in relation to applications made to the Council of the London Borough of Camden. In the case of that authority, there is no requirement to advertise those applications in a newspaper. Instead, the authority is required to advertise the applications by site notice and to place a notice of the application on a website maintained for the purpose of advertisement of applications. This brings the publicity requirement provisions for these applications made to the London Borough of Camden into line with the provisions contained in the Town and Country Planning (London Borough of Camden) Special Development Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/1704), which exempts Camden from the requirement to publicise applications for planning permission in a local newspaper, with the exception of applications that require environmental impact assessment.<BR><BR>
