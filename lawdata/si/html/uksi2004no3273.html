These Regulations amend the Insurance Companies (Overseas Life Assurance Business) Regulations 1995 ("the principal Regulations") in consequence of the adoption, by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union of Directive 2002/83/EC ("the Consolidated Life Assurance Directive").<BR><BR>
Regulation 1 provides for the citation and commencement of this instrument.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2 introduces the amendments.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 inserts a definition of the Consolidated Life Assurance Directive into regulation 2 of the principal Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulations 4 to 11 amend respectively regulation 5, 7, 7A, 8, 13, 14, 14A and 18A of the principal Regulations to secure that the same consequences flow in respect of an authorisation given outside the United Kingdom under the Consolidated Life Assurance Directive as flow from one given in similar circumstances under the first and third long-term life assurance directives (as defined in regulation 2 of the principal Regulations).<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose new costs on business.<BR><BR>
