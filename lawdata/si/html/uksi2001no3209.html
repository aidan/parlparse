These Regulations require passenger ships of Classes III to VI(A) (which are generally known as "small passenger ships"), operating within domestic waters, to develop and implement a Safety Management Code, the details of which are contained in Merchant Shipping Notice 1754(M).<BR><BR>
The Regulations provide in particular for the issue of Domestic Ship Safety Management Certificates by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<I>regulation 6</I>), for the ship to be operated in accordance with the requirements of the Code by its owner, master and operator (<I>regulations</I> 5, 7, and 8), for enforcement (<I>regulation 9</I>), and for offences and penalties (<I>regulation 10</I>).<BR><BR>
The Regulations also make minor drafting corrections to the Merchant Shipping (ISM Code) (Ro-Ro Passenger Ferries) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 1997/3022) and the Merchant Shipping (International Safety Management (ISM) Code) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/1561).<BR><BR>
A Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared and copies can be obtained from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Spring Place, 105 Commercial Road, Southampton SO15 1EG. A copy has been placed in the library of each House of Parliament.<BR><BR>
