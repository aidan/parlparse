These Regulations amend the Civil Aviation (Joint Financing) Regulations 1997 ("the principal Regulations") as follows:<BR><BR>
The charge payable by operators of aircraft to the CAA in respect of crossings between Europe and North America is increased in consequence of a decision of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The element of the charge payable in respect of air navigation services provided by the Government of Denmark is increased from £9.76 to £12.09. The element of the charge payable in respect of air navigation services provided by the Government of Iceland is increased from £35.93 to £43.41. The total charge is thus increased from £45.69 to £55.50 (regulation 2(a)).<BR><BR>
The charges are payable in pursuance of the Agreements on the Joint Financing of certain Air Navigation Services respectively in Greenland and the Faroe Islands and in Iceland, opened for signature in Geneva on 25th September 1956 (Cmnd. Nos. 677 and 678) as amended by the Protocols opened for signature at Montreal on 3rd November 1982 (Cmnd. Nos. 8844 and 8845).<BR><BR>
In consequence of a decision of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation the sum which is to be deducted by the CAA from the charges received and remitted to that Organisation in respect of air navigation services provided by it is reduced from 14.883 per cent to 13.459 per cent (regulation 2(b)).<BR><BR>
The charges are required by the principal Regulations to be remitted to the Governments of Denmark and Iceland subject to the deduction of a fee not exceeding five per cent for the CAA's expenses in billing and collection.<BR><BR>
