These Regulations further amend the Motorways Traffic (Scotland) Regulations 1995 ("the 1995 Regulations") which regulate the use of motorways in Scotland.<BR><BR>
Regulation 11 of the 1995 Regulations prohibits certain classes of vehicle from using the right-hand lane of a motorway carriageway which has three or more lanes at any place where all the lanes are open for use by traffic proceeding in the same direction.<BR><BR>
Regulation 11(1)(aa) is inserted so that a goods vehicle having a maximum laden weight exceeding 3.5 tonnes but not exceeding 7.5 tonnes and to which regulation 36B of the Construction and Use Regulations 1986 ("the 1986 Regulations") applies, or would apply but for paragraph (14)(a) or (b) of that regulation, is a prohibited vehicle for the purpose of regulation 11.<BR><BR>
Regulation 11(1)(bb) is inserted so that a passenger vehicle which is constructed or adapted to carry eight or more seated passengers in addition to the driver, the maximum laden weight of which does not exceed 7.5 tonnes and to which regulation 36A of the 1986 Regulations applies, or would apply but for regulation (13)(a) or (b) of that regulation, is also a prohibited vehicle for the purpose of regulation 11.<BR><BR>
The effect of these amendments is to widen the range of both goods vehicles and passenger carrying vehicles prohibited from using the right-hand lane of a motorway carriageway which has three or more lanes at any place where all the lanes are open for use, based on whether or not a vehicle is required to be fitted with a speed limiter. The prohibition applies regardless of whether a vehicle is &nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) being taken to a place where a speed limiter is to be installed, calibrated, repaired or replaced; or<BR><BR>
(b) completing a journey in the course of which the speed limiter has accidentally ceased to function.<BR><BR>

A regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no significant impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. A regulatory impact assessment was published as part of the public consultation on Directive 2002/85/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ No. L57, 4.12.2002, p.327), which amends Council Directive 92/6/EC on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community (OJ No. L57, 2.3.1992, p.27). The amending Directive is being implemented by way of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/2102) which come into force on 1st January 2005.<BR><BR>
