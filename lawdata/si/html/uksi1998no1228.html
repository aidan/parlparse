(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations, which revoke and replace the Seed Potatoes (Fees) Regulations 1990 and the Seed Potatoes (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 1991, prescribe the fees payable for official examinations of seed potatoes under the Seed Potatoes Regulations 1991, as amended.<BR><BR>
The relative fees for the inspection of growing crops of different classes of seed potatoes have changed to reflect the different amounts of time needed for inspections. In addition a separate fee has been introduced for the inspection of tubers after they have been harvested.<BR><BR>
The matters in respect of which the revised or new fees are prescribed are listed in the Schedule and the fees which were chargeable before these Regulations come into force are printed beside the revised fees.<BR><BR>
The fee to be retained by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of an application for the classification of a crop of seed potatoes which is withdrawn is replaced by a fee of £15 (regulation 4).<BR><BR>
