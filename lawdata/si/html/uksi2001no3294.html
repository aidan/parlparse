Article 2 brings into force in England, on 1st October 2001, section 6 of the 2001 Act.<BR><BR>
Article 3(1) brings into force in England, on 1st October 2001, section 49 of the 2001 Act in relation to persons who are provided with accommodation under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948 and who would be liable to make a payment for that accommodation and the nursing care in connection with that accommodation (under section 22 or 26 of that Act) at the standard rate or at a lower rate which is not less than the standard rate minus £110.
