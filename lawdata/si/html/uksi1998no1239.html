The transfer was made subject to the condition that the land be brought into use wholly or mainly for the purpose of that Council's functions as local education authority for their area by 1st January 1995 and that, if it were not so brought into use, the land be disposed of and the proceeds of sale (after deductions) be divided between the councils of the inner London boroughs and the Common Council of the City of London. This Order now provides that the condition shall cease to apply in relation to that land.<BR><BR>
