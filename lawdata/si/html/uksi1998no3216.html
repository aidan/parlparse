This Order makes provision for transitional and transitory purposes under the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46) ("the Act"). It modifies the type of procedure to which certain subordinate legislation made under the Act is to be subject, where it is made in the period beginning with 25th January 1999 and ending immediately before the principal appointed day (1st July 1999) and where it would otherwise, in terms of the Act, have been subject to a type of procedure in the Scottish Parliament. The Order provides that such subordinate legislation is to be subject to procedure in the UK Parliament.<BR><BR>
