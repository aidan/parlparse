(c) "control device" means a device using the interface which will be used when the measuring equipment is permanently installed which receives a call signal from the fuel dispenser and authorises delivery.".<BR><BR>

These Regulations amend the Measuring Equipment (Liquid Fuel and Lubricants) Regulations 1995 (the "1995 Regulations").<BR><BR>
The Regulations prescribe the tests an inspector of weights and measures shall apply to measuring equipment with a view to passing it as fit for use for trade and stamping it.<BR><BR>
The Regulations also make certain minor amendments and clarifications to the 1995 Regulations.<BR><BR>
These Regulations were notified to the European Commission in accordance with the requirements of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1998 O.J. L204/37), (as amended), (formerly Council Directive 83/189/EEC (1983 O.J. L109/8), (as amended)).<BR><BR>
