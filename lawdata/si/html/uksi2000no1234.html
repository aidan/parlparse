(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order revokes the Undersized Whiting Order 1992 ("the 1992 Order"), except in so far as it forms part of the law of Scotland or has effect in relation to Wales (article 2). The 1992 Order prescribed minimum sizes for the landing and sale in Great Britain, and for carriage on a British fishing boat, of whiting (<I>Merlangius merlangus</I>). It also made related provision for enforcement.<BR><BR>
Minimum sizes for the landing, sale, transportation, storage and carriage of whiting are now prescribed by article 19 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 850/98 (OJ No. L125, 27.04.98, p.1), for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms, as read with article 17 of that Regulation. Provision for the enforcement of restrictions and obligations contained in that Regulation have been laid down in the Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Conservation Measures) Order 2000, which comes into force shortly before this Order.<BR><BR>
