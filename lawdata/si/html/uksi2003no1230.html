(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations implement directive 1999/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7th June 1999 in relation to qualifications which may be required, by competent harbour authorities in the United Kingdom, from persons applying to such authorities for authorisation to act as pilots in inland waters. The Directive established a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the Directives on liberalisation and transitional measures and supplementing the general systems for the recognition of qualifications (O.J. L 201, 31.7.1999, p.77). The Directive was extended to the EEA by Decision of the EEA Joint Committee 88/2000, adopted on 27th October 2000 (O.J. (supplement) L007/05, 1.1.2001).<BR><BR>
