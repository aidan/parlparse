(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (the "PPC Regulations").<BR><BR>
Regulation 2(2) amends the definition of "specified waste management activity" in regulation 2(1) of the PPC Regulations to exclude from the definition certain categories of waste activities where they are carried out at the same installation as any activity falling within Part A(1) of Part I of Schedule 1 to the PPC Regulations and they do not constitute the primary activity of that installation.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2(3) amends regulation 4 of the PPC Regulations (fit and proper person) to apply some of the requirements of that provision only to specified waste management activities consisting of the disposal of waste in a landfill falling within Section 5.2 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the PPC Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2(4) defers the relevant dates specified in the table in paragraph 2(2) of Part 1 of Schedule 3 to the PPC Regulations in respect of activities falling within paragraphs (c)(i) and (ii) of Part A(1) of Section 5.3 of Part 1 of Schedule 3 until 1st April to 30th June 1996 and 1st September to 30th November 2006 respectively.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2(5) provides for the substitution of the reference to Health Authorities by a reference to Local Health Boards in Wales for the purposes of notification by the regulator of the receipt of a PPC application under paragraph 9(1)(a) of Part 2 (Determination of Applications) of Schedule 4 to the PPC Regulations. Regulation 2(5)(b) defines "Local Health Board" as any board established under the Local Health Boards (Establishment) (Wales) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/148 (W.18)).<BR><BR>
