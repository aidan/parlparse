</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order revokes the Crab Claws (Prohibition of Landing) Order 1986 ("the 1986 Order"), except in so far as it forms part of Scottish law or applies to landings in Wales (article 2). The 1986 Order prohibited the landing of crab claws in the United Kingdom if they have been detached from edible crabs (<I>Cancer pagurus</I>) caught within British fishery limits. It also made related provision for enforcement.<BR><BR>
Provisions relating to the retention on board and the landing of edible crabs and detached claws can now be found in article 18.4 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 850/98 (OJ No. L125, 27.04.98, p.1), for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms. Provision for the enforcement of restrictions and obligations contained in that Regulation have been laid down in the Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Conservation Measures) Order 2000, which is to come into force shortly before this Order.<BR><BR>
