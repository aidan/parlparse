These Regulations amend the Dairy Products (Hygiene) (Charges) Regulations 1995, as amended, ("the 1995 Regulations") in relation to England.<BR><BR>
Charges are payable by producers of milk from registered holdings under the 1995 Regulations in respect of dairy farm visits carried out for the purpose of ascertaining whether provisions of the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995, as amended, (S.I. 1995/1086, as amended by S.I. 1995/1763, 1996/1499, 1996/1699, 1997/1729, 1998/2424 and 2000/656) are being met. These Regulations remove liability to such charges, except in respect of visits for the purpose of taking samples of drinking milk which is raw cows' milk for analysis and examination to check compliance with provisions in those Regulations relating to microbiological criteria. The charge in that case remains at £63 (regulations 2 to 5).<BR><BR>
A regulatory impact assessment, which includes a compliance cost assessment of the effect that these Regulations have on business costs, has been prepared and placed in the Library of each House of Parliament. Copies may be obtained from the Microbiological Safety Division of the Food Standards Agency, PO Box 31037, Ergon House, c/o 17 Smith Square, London SW1P 3WG.<BR><BR>
