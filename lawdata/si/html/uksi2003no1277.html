These Regulations amend the Immigration Employment Document (Fees) Regulations 2003. Those Regulations provide that an application for an immigration employment document within the meaning of section 122 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 must be accompanied by a fee of £95 unless the application is an application excepted by those Regulations. These Regulations make two amendments. Firstly they provide that a group application shall be accompanied by a fee of £95 (regulation 4A) unless all persons in that group are persons to whom regulation 5(a) of the principal Regulations apply. A group application will be made when an application is made on behalf of a number of persons who form a group and the persons named in that application seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as persons employed by a ballet or other dance group, theatre group, or orchestra or other group of musicians for the purpose of fulfilling a contractual obligation to perform in that capacity in the United Kingdom. Secondly, they provide that a fee of £74 shall, accompany an application for an immigration employment document where it is made in respect of a person seeking to enter, or remain, in the United Kingdom under the Sectors-Based Scheme (regulation 4B) operated under the immigration rules. This fee shall not be required where the application in question is excepted by regulation 5(a) of the principal Regulations.<BR><BR>
