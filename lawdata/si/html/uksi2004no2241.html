<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations revoke the Coal Mining Subsidence (Subsidence Adviser) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/2563) (the "1994 Regulations"), which provided for the appointment by the Secretary of State of a Subsidence Adviser whose functions related to the statutory rights of persons affected by subsidence. The revocation of the 1994 Regulations removes both the requirement to appoint the Subsidence Adviser and other provisions relating to the Subsidence Adviser's work that are superfluous if the post is no longer in existence. A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no impact on the costs of business.<BR><BR>
