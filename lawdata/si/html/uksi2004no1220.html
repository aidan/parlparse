<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Separate regulations apply in Scotland. Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 specifies that certain sex offenders are required to notify their personal details to the police. Section 86 of that Act enables regulations to make provision requiring such offenders to notify the police of their intention to travel abroad and of their return. These Regulations make provision for this notification in relation to those who intend to leave the United Kingdom for periods of 3 days or more.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 sets out when notification must be given of intended departures.<BR><BR>
Section 86 specifies that the notification must disclose the date of departure from the United Kingdom, the country to which the sex offender will travel (or, if there is more than one, the first country), and the point of arrival in that country. Regulation 6 prescribes additional information to be disclosed.<BR><BR>
Regulation 7 provides for notification of changes or additions to the information provided.<BR><BR>
Regulations 8 and 9 deal with notification on return to the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>
Regulation 10 sets out the procedure for giving notification.<BR><BR>
The Regulations revoke the Sex Offenders (Notice Requirements)(Foreign Travel) Regulations 2001 made under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which required relevant offenders intending to leave the United Kingdom for eight days or longer to notify the police 24 hours before departure. Regulation 3 makes transitional provision for those subject to the 2001 Regulations.<BR><BR>
