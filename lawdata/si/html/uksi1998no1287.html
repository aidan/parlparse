&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The returning officer shall sort the ballot papers into parcels according to the candidates for whom first preference votes are given.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The returning officer shall then count the number of first preference votes given on ballot papers for each candidate and shall record those numbers.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The returning officer shall also ascertain and record the number of valid ballot papers.<BR><BR>
<I>The quota</I><BR>
<B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44E.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The returning officer shall divide the number of valid ballot papers by a number exceeding by one the number of members to be elected.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The result, increased by one, of the division under paragraph (1) above (any fraction being disregarded) shall be the number of votes sufficient to secure the election of a candidate (in these rules referred to as "the quota").<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) At any stage of the count a candidate whose total votes equals or exceeds the quota shall be deemed to be elected, except that at any election where there is only one vacancy a candidate shall not be deemed to be elected until the procedure set out in paragraphs (1) to (3) of rule 44H below has been complied.<BR><BR>
<I>Transfer of votes</I><BR>
<B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44F.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Where the number of first preference votes for any candidate exceeds the quota, the returning officer shall sort all the ballot papers on which first preference votes are given for that candidate into sub-parcels so that they are grouped&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) according to the next available preference given on those papers for any continuing candidate, or<BR><BR>
(b) where no such preference is given, as the sub-parcel of non-transferable votes.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The returning officer shall count the number of ballot papers in each parcel referred to in paragraph (1) above.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The returning officer shall, in accordance with this rule and rule 44G below, transfer each sub-parcel of ballot papers referred to in paragraph (1)(a) above to the candidate for whom the next available preference is given on those papers.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The vote on each ballot paper transferred under paragraph (3) above shall be at a value ("the transfer value") which&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) reduces the value of each vote transferred so that the total value of all such votes does not exceed the surplus; and<BR><BR>
(b) is calculated by dividing the surplus of the candidate from whom the votes are being transferred by the total number of the ballot papers on which those votes are given, the calculation being made to two decimal places (ignoring the remainder if any).<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where at the end of any stage of the count involving the transfer of ballot papers, the number of votes for any candidate exceeds the quota, the returning officer shall sort the ballot papers in the sub-parcel of transferred votes which was last received by that candidate into separate sub-parcels so that they are grouped&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) according to the next available preference given on those papers for any continuing candidate, or<BR><BR>
(b) where no such preference is given, as the sub-parcel of non-transferable votes.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The returning officer shall, in accordance with this rule and rule 44G below, transfer each sub-parcel of ballot papers referred to in paragraph (5)(a) above to the candidate for whom the next available preference is given on those papers.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The vote on each ballot paper transferred under paragraph (6) shall be at&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) a transfer value calculated as set out in paragraph (4)(b) above, or<BR><BR>
(b) at the value at which that vote was received by the candidate from whom it is now being transferred,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
whichever is the less.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Each transfer of a surplus constitutes a stage in the count.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Subject to paragraph (10) below, the returning officer shall proceed to transfer transferable papers until no candidate who is deemed to be elected has a surplus or all the vacancies have been filled.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Transferable papers shall not be liable to be transferred where any surplus or surpluses which, at a particular stage of the count, have not already been transferred, are&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) less than the difference between the total vote then credited to the continuing candidate with the lowest recorded vote and the vote of the candidate with the next lowest recorded vote, or<BR><BR>
(b) less than the difference between the total votes of the two or more continuing candidates, credited at that stage of the count with the lowest recorded total numbers of votes and the candidate next above such candidates.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) This rule shall not apply at an election where there is only one vacancy.<BR><BR>
<I>Supplementary provisions on transfer</I><BR>
<B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44G.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If, at any stage of the count, two or more candidates have surpluses, the transferable papers of the candidate with the highest surplus shall be transferred first, and if&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the surpluses determined in respect of two or more candidates are equal, the transferable papers of the candidate who had the highest recorded vote at the earliest preceding stage at which they had unequal votes, shall be transferred first, and<BR><BR>
(b) the votes credited to two or more candidates were equal at all stages of the count, the returning officer shall decide between those candidates by lot and the transferable papers of the candidate on whom the lot falls shall be transferred first.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The returning officer shall, on each transfer of transferable papers under rule 44F above&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) record the total value of the votes transferred to each candidate;<BR><BR>
(b) add that value to the previous total of votes recorded for each candidate and record the new total;<BR><BR>
(c) record as non-transferable votes the difference between the surplus and the total transfer value of the transferred votes and add that difference to the previously recorded total of non-transferable votes, and<BR><BR>
(d) compare&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) the total number of votes then recorded for all of the candidates, together with the total number of non-transferable votes, with<BR><BR>
(ii) the recorded total of valid first preference votes.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All ballot papers transferred under rule 44F above or 44H below shall be clearly marked, either individually or as a sub-parcel, so as to indicate the transfer value recorded at that time to each vote on that paper or, as the case may be, all the papers in that sub-parcel.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where a ballot paper is so marked that it is unclear to the returning officer at any stage of the count under rule 44F or 44H for which candidate the next preference is recorded, the returning officer shall treat any vote on that ballot paper as a non-transferable vote; and votes on a ballot paper shall be so treated where, for example, the names of two or more candidates (whether continuing candidates or not) are so marked that, in the opinion of the returning officer, the same order of preference is indicated or the numerical sequence is broken.<BR><BR>
<I>Exclusion of candidates</I><BR>
<B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44H.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) all transferable papers which under the provisions of rule 44F above (including that rule as applied by paragraph (11) below) and this rule are required to be transferred, have been transferred, and<BR><BR>
(b) subject to rule 44J below, one or more vacancies remain to be filled,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
the returning officer shall exclude from the election at that stage the candidate with the then lowest vote (or, where paragraph (12) below applies, the candidates with the then lowest votes).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The returning officer shall sort all the ballot papers on which first preference votes are given for the candidate or candidates excluded under paragraph (1) above into two sub-parcels so that they are grouped as&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) ballot papers on which a next available preference is given, and<BR><BR>
(b) ballot papers on which no such preference is given (thereby including ballot papers on which preferences are given only for candidates who are deemed to be elected or are excluded).<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The returning officer shall, in accordance with this rule and rule 44G above, transfer each sub-parcel of ballot papers referred to in paragraph (2)(a) above to the candidate for whom the next available preference is given on those papers.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The exclusion of a candidate, or of two or more candidates together, constitutes a further stage of the count.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If, subject to rule 44J below, one or more vacancies still remain to be filled, the returning officer shall then sort the transferable papers, if any, which had been transferred to any candidate excluded under paragraph (1) above into sub-parcels according to their transfer value.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The returning officer shall transfer those papers in the sub-parcel of transferable papers with the highest transfer value to the continuing candidates in accordance with the next available preferences given on those papers (thereby passing over candidates who are deemed to be elected or are excluded).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The vote on each transferable paper transferred under paragraph (6) above shall be at the value at which that vote was received by the candidate excluded under paragraph (1) above.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Any papers on which no next available preferences have been expressed shall be set aside as non-transferable votes.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) After the returning officer has completed the transfer of the ballot papers in the sub-parcel of ballot papers with the highest transfer value he shall proceed to transfer in the same way the sub-parcel of ballot papers with the next highest value and so on until he has dealt with each sub-parcel of a candidate excluded under paragraph (1) above.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) The returning officer shall after each stage of the count completed under this rule&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) record&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) the total value of votes, or<BR><BR>
(ii) the total transfer value of votes<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
transferred to each candidate;<BR><BR>
(b) add that total to the previous total of votes recorded for each candidate and record the new total;<BR><BR>
(c) record the value of non-transferable votes and add that value to the previous non-transferable votes total; and<BR><BR>
(d) compare&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) the total number of votes then recorded for each candidate together with the total number of non-transferable votes, with<BR><BR>
(ii) the recorded total of valid first preference votes.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) If after a transfer of votes under any provision of this rule, a candidate has a surplus, that surplus shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraphs (5) to (10) of rule 44F and rule 44G.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) Where the total of the votes of the two or more lowest candidates, together with any surpluses not transferred, is less than the number of votes credited to the next lowest candidate, the returning officer shall in one operation exclude such two or more candidates.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(13) If when a candidate has to be excluded under this rule, two or more candidates each have the same number of votes and are lowest&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) regard shall be had to the total number of votes credited to those candidates at the earliest stage of the count at which they had an unequal number of votes and the candidate with the lowest number of votes at that stage shall be excluded; and<BR><BR>
(b) where the number of votes credited to those candidates was equal at all stages, the returning officer shall decide between the candidates by lot and the candidate on whom the lot falls shall be excluded.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
<I>Filling of last vacancies</I><BR>
<B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44J.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Where the number of continuing candidates is equal to the number of vacancies remaining unfilled the continuing candidates shall thereupon be deemed to be elected.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where only one vacancy remains unfilled and the votes of any one continuing candidate are equal to or greater than the total of votes credited to other continuing candidates together with any surplus not transferred, the candidate shall thereupon be deemed to be elected.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the last vacancies can be filled under this rule, no further transfer of votes shall be made.<BR><BR>
<I>Re-count</I><BR>
<B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44K.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The returning officer on completion of each stage of the count shall, before proceeding with the next stage, inform all the candidates and their election agents then present of his intention, subject to a request for a re-count, to proceed to the next stage.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The returning officer shall comply with a request from a candidate or his election agent for a re-count of the last completed stage made before the returning officer proceeds to the next stage, but nothing in this rule shall require the returning officer to re-count the same parcel or sub-parcel more than once.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The returning officer may, if he thinks fit, re-count ballot papers either once or more often.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where as a result of a re-count an error is discovered, the returning officer shall, where necessary, amend any results previously announced by him.<BR><BR>
<I>Order of election of candidates</I><BR>
<B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
44L.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The order in which candidates whose votes equal or exceed the quota are deemed to be elected shall be the order in which their respective surpluses were transferred, or would have been transferred but for rule 44F(10) above.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A candidate credited with a number of votes equal to, and not greater than, the quota shall, for the purposes of this rule, be regarded as having had the smallest surplus at the stage of the count at which he obtained the quota.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the surpluses of two or more candidates are equal and are not required to be transferred, regard shall be had to the total number of votes credited to such candidates at the earliest stage of the count at which they had an unequal number of votes and the surplus of the candidate who had the greatest number of votes at that stage shall be deemed to be the largest.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where the number of votes credited to two or more candidates were equal at all stages of the count, the returning officer shall decide between them by lot and the candidate on whom the lot falls shall be deemed to have been elected first.<BR><BR>
<I>Decisions of returning officer</I><BR>
<B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The decision of the returning officer, whether expressed or implied, on any question which arises in relation to the exclusion of any candidate under rule 44H or to any ballot paper or transfer of votes shall be final, but may be reviewed on an election petition.".<BR><BR>

(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order provides for the conduct of the election of the initial members of the New Northern Ireland Assembly established under section 1 of the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998 and for the conduct of any by-election.<BR><BR>
Paragraphs (1) and (2) of article 3 of the Order apply with the modifications set out in the right-hand columns of Schedules 1 and 2 to the Order the provisions of the Representation of the People Acts 1983 and 1985 and the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) Regulations 1986 which are listed in the left-hand columns of those Schedules. Section 3 (offences) of the Elections (Northern Ireland) Act 1985, the Election Petition Rules 1964 (as amended) and provisions of the Planning (Control of Advertisements) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1992 relating to election notices have also been applied. In addition to the specific modifications in Schedules 1 and 2, general modifications are made by article 3(3).<BR><BR>
Article 6 of this Order (together with rule 8A of the elections rules in Schedule 1 to the 1983 Act, as inserted by Schedule 1 to this Order) provides for a system of substitutes to avoid the need for a by-election where the seat of a candidate returned at the initial election of members of the Assembly falls vacant. Article 7 provides for by-elections where a seat cannot be filled by these means.<BR><BR>
