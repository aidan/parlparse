</B><BR><BR><I>
<I>(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations consolidate with amendments the Town and Country Planning (Development Plan) Regulations 1991 (S.I. 1991/2794) and subsequent amending Regulations (S.I. 1997/531 and S.I. 1999/981).<BR><BR>
The Regulations prescribe the form and content of structure plans, unitary development plans, local plans, waste local plans and minerals local plans. The Regulations also make provision with respect to the procedures to be followed in connection with the preparation, withdrawal, adoption, approval, making, alteration and replacement of such plans.<BR><BR>
The Regulations apply only in England.<BR><BR>
The main changes made by the Regulations are-<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) <B>regulation 20</B> prescribes an expanded list of matters to which a local planning authority must have regard when formulating their policies and proposals in a unitary development plan, local plan, waste local plan or minerals local plan;<BR><BR>
(b) for all plans other than structure plans, <B>regulation 24</B> provides for the deposit of revised proposals before any inquiry or other hearing is held;<BR><BR>
(c) <B>regulation 26(3)</B> requires a local planning authority to make available for inspection within 8 weeks of receipt the report of the person holding an inquiry or other hearing to consider objections to a unitary development plan, local plan, waste local plan or minerals local plan;<BR><BR>
(d) the provisions relating to procedures for structure plans (which are unchanged) appear in a separate part (<B>Part 4</B>).<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
Regulations 9(1)(c) and (d) and 20(1)(c) and (d) implement in part, in relation to town and country planning in England, Article 12 of Council Directive 96/82/EC (O.J. No. L10, 14.1.1997, p. 13) on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances. That Article is implemented in relation to town and country planning also by the Planning (Control of Major-Accident Hazards) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/981).<BR><BR>

1990 c. 8. Sections 12, 26, 31 and 53 were amended by paragraphs 2, 15, 16 and 28 of Schedule 4 to the Planning and Compensation Act 1991 (c. 34). Section 13 was substituted by paragraph 4, sections 33, 36, 37(4), 38(5) and 40 by paragraph 17, and section 46 by paragraph 22 of Schedule 4 to the 1991 Act. <I>See</I> the definition of "prescribed" in section 336(1).
