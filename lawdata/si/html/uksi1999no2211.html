(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 1999. Under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 the new framework for schools takes effect on 1st September 1999 and consequently references to schools in the old school framework become spent on that day and are removed. Regulation 4 is amended to enable the Secretary of State to designate a person (as well as a body) as the appropriate authority in relation to independent schools providing induction. The provisions relating to teachers from Scotland and from EEA countries falling within Article 3 of Council Directive 89/48 EEC (O.J. No. L19, 24.1.89, p. 16) in paragraphs 7 and 9 of Schedule 1 are amended.<BR><BR>
