(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends Schedule 1 to the Returning Officers (Parliamentary Constituencies) (Wales) Order 1996 (S.I.1996/897) by designating returning officers in three further county constituencies in Wales, namely Conwy, Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and Merthyr Tydfil &amp; Rhymney, which, by reason of the changes made by the Preserved Counties (Amendment to Boundaries) (Wales) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/974), are no longer coterminous with or wholly contained in a preserved county in Wales.<BR><BR>
The 1996 Order designated returning officers in the county constituencies of Bridgend, Clwyd South and Pontypridd, which are unaffected by the changes made to the preserved county boundaries by the 2003 Order.<BR><BR>
