&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The verifying authority shall exercise the functions conferred by this article in relation to each of English and mathematics and&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) subject to paragraph (3), in any school year in relation to at least 25% of all relevant schools;<BR><BR>
(b) in each school year, in relation to those schools in relation to which verification took place in the last preceding school year and in the opinion of the verifying authority, having regard to the results of that verification, a further verification should be made.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) If after such verification the verifying authority consider that the results of the assessments are accurate, they shall so notify the head teacher, and the levels of all pupils at the school determined by standard task assessments (whether or not verified) shall be the levels for the subject in question.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order revokes and replaces the Education (National Curriculum) (Assessment Arrangements for the Core Subjects) (Key Stage 1) (England) Order 1995. It specifies the assessment arrangements for the core subjects in the final year of the first key stage, as they apply to maintained schools in England. "Maintained schools" are now defined to mean, in relation to the period before 1st September 1999, any county, voluntary or grant-maintained school or any maintained special or grant-maintained special school which is not established in a hospital and, in relation to the period on and after that date, to mean any community, foundation or voluntary school or any community or foundation special school not established in a hospital (article 3(1)).<BR><BR>
The other main change from the 1995 Order is in article 6 (verification of assessments). The verifying authority for schools to which this Order applies is the local education authority.<BR><BR>
