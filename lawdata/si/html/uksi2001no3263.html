Paragraph (1) of Schedule 7 to the Electricity Act 1989 provides that where a customer of an electricity supplier is to be charged wholly or partly by reference to the quantity of electricity supplied, the supply shall be given through, and the quantity of electricity shall be ascertained by, an appropriate meter. Paragraph (1A) of Schedule 7, as inserted by the Utilities Act 2000, provides that an electricity supplier may give a supply otherwise than through an appropriate meter in such circumstances as may be prescribed. These Regulations prescribe the circumstances in which a supply of electricity may be unmetered.<BR><BR>
