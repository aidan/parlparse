Requirements relating to retractable and loadable axles</B><BR>

(b) is first used on or after 1 January 2002.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), under all driving conditions other than those described in sub-paragraph (3), the maximum authorised weight on any axle shall be the weight specified in column (3) of Table 5 or in column (5) of Table 6 (as may be appropriate) and the retractable axle or the loadable axle shall lower to the ground automatically if&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the front axle on the vehicle is laden to that maximum authorised weight, or<BR><BR>
(b) in the case of a vehicle having a group of axles, the nearest axle or axles is or are laden to that maximum authorised weight;<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
and in paragraph (a) above "axle" is a reference to an axle described in column (2) of items 1 or 2 of Table 5 in Schedule 3 and in paragraph (b) above "group of axles" is a reference to an axle described in column (2) of items 3 to 6 of that Table.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The driving conditions referred to in sub-paragraph (2) exist where a vehicle is on a slippery surface and, accordingly in order to help vehicles or vehicle combinations to move off on slippery ground, and to increase the traction of their tyres on slippery surfaces, the axle-lift device may also actuate the retractable axle or the loadable axle of the vehicle of semi-trailer to increase the weight on the driving axle of the vehicle, subject as follows:&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the weight corresponding to the load on each axle of the vehicle may exceed the relevant maximum authorised weight by up to 30 per cent. so long as it does not exceed the value stated by the manufacturer for this special purpose;<BR><BR>
(b) the weight corresponding to the remaining load on the front axle shall remain above zero;<BR><BR>
(c) the retractable axle or the loadable axle shall be actuated only by a special control device; and<BR><BR>
(d) after the vehicle has moved off and reached a speed of 30 kms per hour, the axle shall automatically lower again to the ground or be reloaded.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Every retractable axle or loadable axle fitted to a vehicle to which these Regulations apply, and any system for its operation, shall be designed and installed in such a manner as to protect it against improper use or tampering.".<BR><BR>

(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations give effect to the proposals in "Transport 2010, The 10 Year Plan" (published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on 20th July 2000) relating to the introduction of 44 tonne motor vehicles and trailers into the United Kingdom on 1st February 2001. They amend the Road Vehicles (Authorised Weight) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/3111) to permit the use of such vehicles from that date and make consequential amendments. The Regulations also provide, with effect from 1st January 2002, safeguards against the misuse of current axle lift technology and the emission of pollutants.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 amends regulation 2 of the 1998 Regulations (interpretation) by introducing a new definition of an "axle-lift device" to reflect the requirements of Directive 97/27/EC and of a "low pollutant engine" which incorporates the new system requirements for the Euro II engine specified in Directive 91/542/EEC (which amends Directive 88/77/EEC).<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 amends regulation 4 (maximum authorised weights) to ensure that an offence may be committed by non-compliance with the new requirements in Schedule 3 even if the vehicle complies with regulations 75 to79 and 80 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 (S.I. 1986/1078).<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 provides that regulation 80 of the 1986 Regulations is not contravened when a vehicle is operated in accordance with paragraph 3 of Schedule 3.<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 inserts into Schedule 2 (maximum authorised weights for vehicle combinations) entries for vehicle combinations with a maximum authorised weight of 44 tonnes, and adds a requirement for the use of a low pollutant engine.<BR><BR>
Regulation 7 introduces maximum authorised weight and other requirements for retractable and loadable axles, with special provisions for the moving off by vehicles on slippery slopes.<BR><BR>
These Regulations have been notified to the European Commission pursuant to Directive 83/189/EEC of 28th March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (OJ 1983 L109, p 9) as amended by Council Directive 88/182/EEC of 22nd March 1988 (OJ 1988 L81, p 75) and European Parliament and Council Directive 84/10EEC of 23rd March 1994 (OJ 1994 L100, p 30).<BR><BR>
