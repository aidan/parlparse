This Order varies the constitution of the local fisheries committee for the Sussex Sea Fisheries District (originally constituted in 1893 by order of the Board of Trade under the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act 1888 (c.54)) to take account of the changes made to the structure of local government in England under the Local Government Act 1992 (c.19) and, in particular, the East Sussex (Boroughs of Brighton and Hove) (Structural Change) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995/1770). Since the number and size of the constituent councils has altered, the number of representatives from each council and their proportionate contributions to the expenses of the committee have been revised (article 2 and Schedule).<BR><BR>
