These Regulations amend the NCIS (Complaints) Regulations 1998 (the 1998 Regulations) in relation to complaints against seconded police members.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 amends and inserts certain definitions in regulation 2 of the 1998 Regulations. Regulation 5 inserts a new Part III in the 1998 Regulations which makes provision for the procedures for handling complaints relating to the conduct of police members of NCIS who are engaged on temporary service under section 97 of the Police Act 1996 ("seconded police members"). Part III generally mirrors Chapter I of Part IV of that Act in its application to members of police forces other than senior officers. Regulation 4 makes minor and consequential amendments to Part I of the 1998 Regulations.<BR><BR>
