* <B>Explanatory note: The structure of the elements of the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes follows the structure of the corresponding provisions of articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Rome Statute. Some paragraphs of those articles of the Rome Statute list multiple crimes. In those instances, the elements of crimes appear in separate paragraphs which correspond to each of those crimes to facilitate the identification of the respective elements.</B><BR><BR>
<B>
Elements of Crimes</B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
General Introduction</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
1.</B>
Pursuant to article 9, the following Elements of Crimes shall assist the Court in the interpretation and application of articles 6, 7 and 8, consistent with the Statute. The provisions of the Statute, including article 21 and the general principles set out in Part 3, are applicable to the Elements of Crimes.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
2.</B>
As stated in article 30, unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge. Where no reference is made in the Elements of Crimes to a mental element for any particular conduct, consequence or circumstance listed, it is understood that the relevant mental element, i.e., intent, knowledge or both, set out in article 30 applies. Exceptions to the article 30 standard, based on the Statute, including applicable law under its relevant provisions, are indicated below.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
3.</B>
Existence of intent and knowledge can be inferred from relevant facts and circumstances.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
4.</B>
With respect to mental elements associated with elements involving value judgement, such as those using the terms "inhumane" or "severe", it is not necessary that the perpetrator personally completed a particular value judgement, unless otherwise indicated.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
5.</B>
Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility or the absence thereof are generally not specified in the elements of crimes listed under each crime.[<a name="n3"><a href="#note3">3</A>]<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
6.</B>
The requirement of "unlawfulness" found in the Statute or in other parts of international law, in particular international humanitarian law, is generally not specified in the elements of crimes.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
7.</B>
The elements of crimes are generally structured in accordance with the following principles:<BR><BR>
<UL>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; As the elements of crimes focus on the conduct, consequences and circumstances associated with each crime, they are generally listed in that order;</UL><P>
<UL>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; When required, a particular mental element is listed after the affected conduct, consequence or circumstance;</UL><P>
<UL>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Contextual circumstances are listed last.</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
8.</B>
As used in the Elements of Crimes, the term "perpetrator" is neutral as to guilt or innocence. The elements, including the appropriate mental elements, apply, <I>mutatis mutandis,</I> to all those whose criminal responsibility may fall under articles 25 and 28 of the Statute.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
9.</B>
A particular conduct may constitute one or more crimes.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
10.</B>
The use of short titles for the crimes has no legal effect.<BR><BR>
<B>
Article 6</B><BR><BR>
<B>
Genocide</B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
Introduction</B><BR>
With respect to the last element listed for each crime:<BR><BR>
<UL>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; The term "in the context of" would include the initial acts in an emerging pattern;</UL><P>
<UL>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; The term "manifest" is an objective qualification;</UL><P>
<UL>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Notwithstanding the normal requirement for a mental element provided for in article 30, and recognising that knowledge of the circumstances will usually be addressed in proving genocidal intent, the appropriate requirement, if any, for a mental element regarding this circumstance will need to be decided by the Court on a case-by-case basis.</UL><P>

Article 7</B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
Crimes against humanity</B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
Introduction</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
1.</B>
Since article 7 pertains to international criminal law, its provisions, consistent with article 22, must be strictly construed, taking into account that crimes against humanity as defined in article 7 are among the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole, warrant and entail individual criminal responsibility, and require conduct which is impermissible under generally applicable international law, as recognised by the principal legal systems of the world.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
2.</B>
The last two elements for each crime against humanity describe the context in which the conduct must take place. These elements clarify the requisite participation in and knowledge of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. However, the last element should not be interpreted as requiring proof that the perpetrator has knowledge of all characteristics of the attack or the precise details of the plan or policy of the State or organisation. In the case of an emerging widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population, the intent clause of the last element indicates that this mental element is satisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
3.</B>
"Attack directed against a civilian population" in these context elements is understood to mean a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in article 7, paragraph 1, of the Statute against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organisational policy to commit such attack. The acts need not constitute a military attack. It is understood that "policy to commit such attack" requires that the State or organisation actively promote or encourage such an attack against a civilian population.[<a name="n8"><a href="#note8">8</A>]<BR><BR>

<a name="note8">
[8]
A policy which has a civilian population as the object of the attack would be implemented by State or organisation action. Such a policy may, in exceptional circumstances, be implemented by a deliberate failure to take action, which is consciously aimed at encouraging such attack. The existence of such a policy cannot be inferred solely from the absence of governmental or organisational action.<a href="#n8">back</a><p>
<a name="note9">
[9]
The term "killed" is interchangeable with the term "caused death". This footnote applies to all elements which use either of these concepts.<a href="#n9">back</a><p>
<a name="note10">

[16]
It is understood that no specific purpose need be proved for this crime.<a href="#n16">back</a><p>
<a name="note17">
[17]
The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral.<a href="#n17">back</a><p>
<a name="note18">
[18]
It is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity. This footnote also applies to the corresponding elements of article 7(1)(g)-3, 5 and 6.<a href="#n18">back</a><p>
<a name="note19">
[19]
Given the complex nature of this crime, it is recognised that its commission could involve more than one perpetrator as a part of a common criminal purpose.<a href="#n19">back</a><p>
<a name="note20">
[20]
It is understood that such deprivation of liberty may, in some circumstances, include exacting forced labour or otherwise reducing a person to a servile status as defined in the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956.

<a name="note22">
[22]
It is understood that "genuine consent" does not include consent obtained through deception.<a href="#n22">back</a><p>
<a name="note23">
[23]
This requirement is without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the General Introduction to the Elements of Crimes.<a href="#n23">back</a><p>
<a name="note24">
[24]
It is understood that no additional mental element is necessary for this element other than that inherent in element 6.<a href="#n24">back</a><p>
<a name="note25">
[25]
Given the complex nature of this crime, it is recognised that its commission will normally involve more than one perpetrator as a part of a common criminal purpose.<a href="#n25">back</a><p>
<a name="note26">
[26]
This crime falls under the jurisdiction of the Court only if the attack referred to in elements 7 and 8 occurs after the entry into force of the Statute.<a href="#n26">back</a><p>
<a name="note27">
[27]
The word "detained" would include a perpetrator who maintained an existing detention.<a href="#n27">back</a><p>
<a name="note28">
[28]
It is understood that under certain circumstances an arrest or detention may have been lawful.<a href="#n28">back</a><p>
<a name="note29">
[29]
This element, inserted because of the complexity of this crime, is without prejudice to the General Introduction to the Elements of Crimes.<a href="#n29">back</a><p>
<a name="note30">
[30]
It is understood that, in the case of a perpetrator who maintained an existing detention, this element would be satisfied if the perpetrator was aware that such a refusal had already taken place.<a href="#n30">back</a><p>
<a name="note31">
[31]
It is understood that "character" refers to the nature and gravity of the act.<a href="#n31">back</a><p>
<a name="note32">
[32]
It is understood that "character" refers to the nature and gravity of the act.<a href="#n32">back</a><p>
<a name="note33">
[33]
The term "killed" is interchangeable with the term "caused death". This footnote applies to all elements which use either of these concepts.<a href="#n33">back</a><p>
<a name="note34">
[34]
This mental element recognises the interplay between articles 30 and 32. This footnote also applies to the corresponding element in each crime under article 8(2)(a), and to the element in other crimes in article 8(2) concerning the awareness of factual circumstances that establish the status of persons or property protected under the relevant international law of armed conflict.<a href="#n34">back</a><p>
<a name="note35">
[35]
With respect to nationality, it is understood that the perpetrator needs only to know that the victim belonged to an adverse party to the conflict. This footnote also applies to the corresponding element in each crime under article 8(2)(a).<a href="#n35">back</a><p>
<a name="note36">
[36]
The term "international armed conflict" includes military occupation. This footnote also applies to the corresponding element in each crime under article 8(2)(a).<a href="#n36">back</a><p>
<a name="note37">
[37]
As element 3 requires that all victims must be "protected persons" under one or more of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, these elements do not include the custody or control requirement found in the elements of article 7(1)(e).<a href="#n37">back</a><p>
<a name="note38">
[38]
The expression "concrete and direct overall military advantage" refers to a military advantage that is foreseeable by the perpetrator at the relevant time. Such advantage may or may not be temporally or geographically related to the object of the attack. The fact that this crime admits the possibility of lawful incidental injury and collateral damage does not in any way justify any violation of the law applicable in armed conflict. It does not address justification for war or other rules related to <I>jus ad bellum</I>. It reflects the proportionality requirement inherent in determining the legality of any military activity undertaken in the context of an armed conflict.<a href="#n38">back</a><p>
<a name="note39">
[39]
As opposed to the general rule set forth in paragraph 4 of the General Introduction, this knowledge element requires that the perpetrator make the value judgement as described therein. An evaluation of that value judgement must be based on the requisite information available to the perpetrator at the time.<a href="#n39">back</a><p>
<a name="note40">
[40]
The presence in the locality of persons specially protected under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 or of police forces retained for the sole purpose of maintaining law and order does not by itself render the locality a military objective.<a href="#n40">back</a><p>
<a name="note41">
[41]
This mental element recognises the interplay between article 30 and article 32. The term "prohibited nature" denotes illegality.<a href="#n41">back</a><p>
<a name="note42">
[42]
This mental element recognises the interplay between article 30 and article 32. The term "prohibited nature" denotes illegality.<a href="#n42">back</a><p>
<a name="note43">
[43]
This mental element recognises the interplay between article 30 and article 32. The "should have known" test required in the other offences found in article 8(2)(b)(vii) is not applicable here because of the variable and regulatory nature of the relevant prohibitions.<a href="#n43">back</a><p>
<a name="note44">
[44]
"Combatant purposes" in these circumstances means purposes directly related to hostilities and not including medical, religious or similar activities.<a href="#n44">back</a><p>
<a name="note45">
[45]
This mental element recognises the interplay between article 30 and article 32. The term "prohibited nature" denotes illegality.<a href="#n45">back</a><p>
<a name="note46">
[46]
The term "transfer" needs to be interpreted in accordance with the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law.<a href="#n46">back</a><p>
<a name="note47">
[47]
The presence in the locality of persons specially protected under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 or of police forces retained for the sole purpose of maintaining law and order does not by itself render the locality a military objective.<a href="#n47">back</a><p>
<a name="note48">
[48]
Consent is not a defence to this crime. The crime prohibits any medical procedure which is not indicated by the state of health of the person concerned and which is not consistent with generally accepted medical standards which would be applied under similar medical circumstances to persons who are nationals of the party conducting the procedure and who are in no way deprived of liberty. This footnote also applies to the same element for article 8(2)(b)(x)-2.<a href="#n48">back</a><p>
<a name="note49">
[49]
As indicated by the use of the term "private or personal use", appropriations justified by military necessity cannot constitute the crime of pillaging.<a href="#n49">back</a><p>
<a name="note50">
[50]
Nothing in this element shall be interpreted as limiting or prejudicing in any way existing or developing rules of international law with respect to the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.<a href="#n50">back</a><p>
<a name="note51">
[51]
For this crime, "persons" can include dead persons. It is understood that the victim need not personally be aware of the existence of the humiliation or degradation or other violation. This element takes into account relevant aspects of the cultural background of the victim.<a href="#n51">back</a><p>
<a name="note52">
[52]
The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral.<a href="#n52">back</a><p>
<a name="note53">
[53]
It is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity. This footnote also applies to the corresponding elements of article 8(2)(b)(xxii)-3, 5 and 6.<a href="#n53">back</a><p>

<a name="note59">
[59]

<a name="note60">
[60]
The elements laid down in these documents do not address the different forms of individual criminal responsibility, as enunciated in articles 25 and 28 of the Statute.<a href="#n60">back</a><p>
<a name="note61">
[61]
With respect to elements 4 and 5, the Court should consider whether, in the light of all relevant circumstances, the cumulative effect of factors with respect to guarantees deprived the person or persons of a fair trial.<a href="#n61">back</a><p>
<a name="note62">
[62]
