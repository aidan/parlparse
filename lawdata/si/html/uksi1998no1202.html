These Regulations establish an action programme for nitrate vulnerable zones which were designated by the Protection of Water against Agricultural Nitrate Pollution (England and Wales) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/888). The Regulations implement, as regards England and Wales, the requirement to establish such a programme in Article 5 of Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources (OJ No. L.375, 31.12.91, p.1).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
2.</B>
Regulation 3 requires the occupier of a farm or livestock unit all or part of which is in a nitrate vulnerable zone to ensure that the action programme set out in the Schedule to the Regulations is implemented in relation to the farm or livestock unit or to that part of it which is in the nitrate vulnerable zone.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
3.</B>
These Regulations provide for monitoring of the action programme (regulation 6), for notices to be served requiring remedial action where there is, or has been, a contravention of the requirement in regulation 3 to ensure the action programme is implemented (regulation 4) and for a procedure to appeal against notices requiring remedial action (regulation 5).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
4.</B>
Breaches of regulations 3, 4 and 6 are made criminal offences (regulation 8).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A Regulatory Appraisal in relation to these Regulations has been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament and copies can be obtained from Rural and Marine Environment Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Room 139, Nobel House, 17 Smith Square, London SW1P 3JR.<BR><BR>
