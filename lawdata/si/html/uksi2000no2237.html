This Order amends the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and, in particular, inserts new sections 124B and 124C into that Act. The new section 124B specifies the procedure whereby a road may become or cease to be a GLA side road and section 124C provides for the giving of certificates as evidence that a road is or is not a GLA side road and for the keeping of records of the roads which are GLA side roads. The new sections are based on sections 14B and 14C of the Highways Act 1980 modified so as to apply them to GLA side roads.<BR><BR>
