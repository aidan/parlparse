<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations further amend the National Health Service (Clinical Negligence Scheme) Regulations 1996 which established a Scheme whereby NHS trusts and certain other bodies providing NHS services may make provision for meeting liabilities to third parties in connection with personal injury arising out of negligence in the carrying out of their functions.<BR><BR>
In particular they provide for the Secretary of State to make payments under the Scheme to third parties on behalf of members. They also make minor amendments relating to the matters the Secretary of State shall consider in determining payments under the Scheme and provide for additional circumstances where he may refuse to meet any liabilities. Provision is also made, by the insertion of a new regulation 9A, enabling the Secretary of State to make payments on account of any payment which may become payable by him under regulation 9.<BR><BR>
