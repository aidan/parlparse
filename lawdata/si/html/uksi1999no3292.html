<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Special Commissioners (Jurisdiction and Procedure) Regulations 1994 ("the principal Regulations") so as to make provision for appeals against amendments of self assessments.<BR><BR>
Regulation 1 provides for citation and commencement and regulation 2 for interpretation.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 amends the definition of "proceedings" in regulation 2 of the principal Regulations so that it includes questions in dispute on an appeal which fall to be determined by the Special Commissioners.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 amends regulation 18(10) of the principal Regulations. The amendment disapplies the requirement for a document recording the final determination of the Special Commissioners to be accompanied by a notification of provisions relating to appeal rights. It disapplies that requirement in relation to a final determination made at the conclusion of an appeal in which a question has been referred to the Lands Tribunal, the Lands Tribunal for Scotland or the Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland in accordance with regulation 23 of the principal Regulations, and all appeal rights in relation to the questions in issue arising on the appeal have been exhausted.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 amends regulation 22, and regulation 6 substitutes a new regulation 23, of the principal Regulations in connection with references of questions involving the value of land by the Special Commissioners to the Lands Tribunal, the Lands Tribunal for Scotland or the Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland.<BR><BR>
