(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Education (Transition to New Framework) (New Schools, Groups and Miscellaneous) Regulations 1999.<BR><BR>
They substitute regulation 54 (transfer of land) by an amended regulation 54 and a new regulation 54A. They insert a new regulation 54B (transfer of property other than land). The purpose of these amendments is to correct an error in regulation 54 so as to ensure that, in the case of any grouped school, any property other than land and any rights and liabilities not relating to land which were held, acquired or incurred by the grouped governing body, transfer to the individual governing body of the appropriate school.<BR><BR>
The Regulations also provide for any such property, rights or liabilities which, prior to the coming into force of these Regulations, have transferred to a local education authority under regulation 54, to be transferred to the individual governing body of the appropriate school.<BR><BR>
