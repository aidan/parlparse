This Order, which is made under section 13 of the Food Safety Act 1990, corrects drafting errors in the Food (Cheese) (Emergency Control) Order 1998. That Order imposes emergency controls on cheese originating from R. A. Duckett &amp; Co. Ltd., Walnut Tree Farm, Wedmore, Somerset.<BR><BR>
The errors occur in Article 4(2), which adapts section 9(2) to (9) of the Food Safety Act 1990 to make provision for the seizure and destruction of cheese originating from that source.<BR><BR>
