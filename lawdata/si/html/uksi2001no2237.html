<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order modifies primary and secondary legislation and makes other provisions for the purposes of, in consequence of, or for giving full effect to provisions in Part II of the Local Government Act 2000 ("the 2000 Act"). This Order and the modifications made by it apply to England only.<BR><BR>
Articles 3 to 9 make modifications to the Local Government Act 1972. <B>Article 3</B> prevents a local authority or joint authority from promoting a Bill to form, alter or abolish executive arrangements or alternative arrangements or to alter arrangements for electing a mayor. <B>Articles 4 and 5</B> apply the qualifications and disqualifications for election and holding office as a member of a local authority to election and holding office as an elected mayor. <B>Article 6</B> extends to elected mayors and executive leaders provisions for the validity of acts done by unqualified persons. <B>Article 7</B> modifies the provisions for the vacation of office by failure to attend meetings so that they apply to members of the executive. <B>Article 8</B> modifies the provisions for members of local authorities not to be appointed as officers so that a person who is a member of a leader and cabinet executive (who will also be a member of the authority) may be appointed to paid office during the twelve month period after he ceases to be such an executive member. <B>Article 9</B> modifies the interpretation provision by inserting a definition of "alternative arrangements".<BR><BR>
<B>Article 10</B> modifies section 31A of the Local Government Act 1974 so that restrictions relating to consideration of a report from the Ombudsman apply equally to the executive, committees of the executive and members of the executive as they do to committees of and members of the authority.<BR><BR>
<B>Article 11</B> modifies section 41 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 so that records of decisions made by the executive, members of the executive and committees of the executive can be used as evidence in civil proceedings in the same way as minutes of meetings of the council and its committees.<BR><BR>
<B>Article 12</B> modifies section 35 of the Local Government Act 1985 so that a member of a leader and cabinet executive is not disqualified from membership of a joint authority.<BR><BR>
<B>Article 13</B> modifies section 74 of the Transport Act 1974 so that a member of the executive who is also a director of a public transport company cannot take part in meetings of the executive or a committee of the executive or make a decision acting alone where contracts concerning that company are being considered.<BR><BR>
<B>Article 14</B> makes a consequential amendment to section 5 of the Weights and Measures Act 1985.<BR><BR>
