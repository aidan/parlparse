<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Under Part II of Schedule 8 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988 ("the 1988 Act"), billing authorities are required to pay amounts (called non-domestic rating contributions) to an account held by the Secretary of State ("the national non-domestic rating pool"). The national non-domestic rating pool is subsequently distributed to authorities under the rules in Part III of Schedule 8 to the 1988 Act. Payments into the national non-domestic rating pool in respect of the provisional amount of the non-domestic rating contributions are made during the financial year, final calculations and adjustments of the non-domestic rating contributions are made after the year ends.<BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the rules for calculation of non-domestic rating contributions and the assumptions to be made in calculating the provisional amount of the non-domestic rating contributions contained in the Non-Domestic Rating Contributions (England) Regulations 1992 ("the 1992 Regulations"), for financial years beginning on or after 1st April 2005. They make amendments in relation to&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the offset for a special authority in paragraph 1(4) of Schedule 1 to the 1992 Regulations;<BR><BR>
(b) the national cost of collection figure in paragraph 4(4) of Schedule 1 to the 1992 Regulations;<BR><BR>
(c) the cost factors in Part II of Schedule 1 to the 1992 Regulations;<BR><BR>
(d) the buoyancy factor in paragraph 2(12) of Schedule 2 to the 1992 regulations; and<BR><BR>
(e) the losses in collection percentages in paragraph 8(1) of Schedule 2 to the 1992 Regulations.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
Following an amendment to the 1988 Act by sections 61 and 62 of the Local Government Act 2003 (c.26), a small business non-domestic rating multiplier is created in addition to the existing standard non-domestic rating multiplier. The amendments to regulation 2 of the 1992 Regulations are consequential to the creation of this new multiplier.<BR><BR>
