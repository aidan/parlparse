(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations, which come into force on 1st January 2001, further amend the Statistics of Trade (Customs and Excise) Regulations 1992 (S.I.1992/2790) ("the 1992 Regulations").<BR><BR>
The 1992 Regulations supplemented Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3330/91 (O.J. No.L316, 16.11.1991, p.1) ("the Principal Regulation") on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between member States and Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 2256/92 (O.J. No.L219, 4.8.92, p.40) on statistical thresholds for the statistics on trade between member States ("the Threshold Regulation").<BR><BR>
The Principal Regulation was amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 3046/92 (O.J. No.L307, 23.10.92, p.27) laying down provisions implementing and amending the Principal Regulation, and, from 1st January 2001, by Regulation (EC) No. 1182/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (O.J. No.L144, 9.6.1999, p.1) ("the Amending Regulation").<BR><BR>
The Threshold Regulation is repealed and replaced from 1st January 2001 by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2000 (O.J. No.L228, 8.9.2000, p.28) ("the Implementing Regulation").<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends the definitions of the expressions "Principal Regulation" and "Threshold Regulation" respectively in regulation 1(2) of the 1992 Regulations. These amendments are necessary in consequence of the amendments to the Principal Regulation and the repeal and replacement of the Threshold Regulation.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 of these Regulations amends regulation 3 of the 1992 Regulations which supplements Article 13(1) of the Principal Regulation (as amended by Article 1(1) of the Amending Regulation) and Article 19(1)(c) of the Implementing Regulation. The reference in regulation 3 of the 1992 Regulations to Article 9 of the Threshold Regulation is replaced by a reference to the corresponding provision in the Implementing Regulation which repeals and replaces the Threshold Regulation. In addition, regulation 3 of the 1992 Regulations is amended so as to allow a supplementary declaration which is furnished by electronic means (as defined for the purposes of the 1992 Regulations) to be furnished by the last day of the month following the end of the reference period to which it relates, instead of by the tenth day following the end of that reference period.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 amends an incorrect reference in regulation 4(2) of the 1992 Regulations. In addition, regulation 5 amends regulation 4 of the 1992 Regulations which supplements Article 23(3) of the Principle Regulation (as amended by Article 1(2)(c) of the Amending Regulation) and Article 19 of the Implementing Regulation. The effect of the amendments is to remove the requirement for a declarant whose annual value of goods arriving from, or dispatched to other member States, does not exceed £12,500,000, to include particulars relating to delivery terms in his supplementary declarations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 of, and the Schedule to, these Regulations replace the forms of supplementary declarations set out in the Schedule to the 1992 Regulations. The new forms of supplementary declarations supplement Article 23(3) of the Principal Regulation (as amended by Article 1(2)(c) of the Amending Regulation) and Article 19 of the Implementing Regulation. The effects of the amendments are to remove the requirements for declarants to provide in their supplementary declarations particulars relating to mode of transport, country of origin and number of consignments.<BR><BR>
Regulation 7 revokes the Statistics of Trade (Customs and Excise) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 (S.I.1999/3269).<BR><BR>
