(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Under Schedule A1 to the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, where the Central Arbitration Committee arranges a ballot on the recognition or derecognition of a trade union for collective bargaining, it must appoint a "qualified independent person" to conduct the ballot.<BR><BR>
The Recognition and Derecognition Ballots (Qualified Persons) Order 2000 specifies conditions which must be satisfied in order for an individual or partnership to qualify for appointment as a scrutineer. It also specifies certain bodies by name as being qualified.<BR><BR>
This Order amends the 2000 Order by replacing the list of bodies specified by name as being qualified for appointment.<BR><BR>
