</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations further amend the Motorways Traffic (England and Wales) Regulations 1982 ("the 1982 Regulations").<BR><BR>
Regulation 12 of the 1982 Regulations prohibits certain classes of vehicle from using the right hand or off side lane of a motorway carriageway which has three or more lanes at any place where all the lanes are open for use by traffic proceeding in the same direction.<BR><BR>
Regulation 12(1)(aa) is inserted so that a goods vehicle having a maximum laden weight exceeding 3.5 tonnes but not exceeding 7.5 tonnes and to which regulation 36B of the Construction and Use Regulations 1986 ("the 1986 Regulations") applies, or would apply but for paragraph (14)(a) or (b) of that regulation, is a prohibited vehicle for the purpose of regulation 12.<BR><BR>
Regulation 12(1)(bb) is inserted so that a passenger vehicle which is constructed or adapted to carry eight or more seated passengers in addition to the driver, the maximum laden weight of which does not exceed 7.5 tonnes and to which regulation 36A of the 1986 Regulations applies, or would apply but for regulation (13)(a) or (b) of that regulation, is also a prohibited vehicle for the purpose of regulation 12.<BR><BR>
The effect of these amendments is to widen the range of both goods vehicles and passenger carrying vehicles prohibited from using the right hand or off side lane of a motorway carriageway which has three or more lanes at any place where all the lanes are open for use, based on whether or not a vehicle is required to be fitted with a speed limiter. The prohibition applies regardless of whether a vehicle is&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) being taken to a place where a speed limiter is to be installed, calibrated, repaired or replaced; or<BR><BR>
(b) completing a journey in the course of which the speed limiter has accidentally ceased to function.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
Regulation 16 of the 1982 Regulations provides exceptions and relaxations in relation to the use of a motorway.<BR><BR>
Regulation 16(1)(a), (b) and (d) are amended so that a person is not precluded from using a motorway, otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the 1982 Regulations, where&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) he does so in accordance with any direction or permission given by a traffic officer in uniform;<BR><BR>
(b) in accordance with any permission given by a traffic officer in uniform, he does so for the purpose of investigating any accident which has occurred on or near a motorway; or<BR><BR>
(c) he does so in the exercise of his duty as a traffic officer, when in uniform.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
A regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no significant impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. Regulatory impact assessments were published in relation to the Traffic Management Act 2004 in respect of traffic officers and as part of the public consultation on Directive 2002/85/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ No. L57, 4.12.2002, p.327), which amends Council Directive 92/6/EC on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community (OJ No. L57, 2.3.1992, p.27). The amending Directive is being implemented by way of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/2102) which come into force on 1st January 2005.<BR><BR>
