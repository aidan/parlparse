(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Artificial Insemination of Cattle (Animal Health) (England and Wales) Regulations 1985 (S.I. 1985/1861, as amended by S.I.s 1987/904, 1992/671, 1995/2549, 2001/380 and 2002/824) ("the 1985 Regulations").<BR><BR>
They implement for England Council Directive 2003/43/EC (amending Directive 88/407/EEC laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species) (OJ L143 11.6.2003, p.23 and OJ L194 22.7.1988, p. 10). Council Directive 2003/43/EC imposes additional testing requirements for donor bulls and for semen intended for intra-Community trade. These additional testing requirements are set out in the amended Annexes to Directive 88/407. The requirements of both Directives are implemented principally by regulation 9A of the 1985 Regulations (which requires compliance with article 3 of "the Directive"). Regulation 2(3)(a) of these Regulations amends the definition of "the Directive" in regulation 2(1) of the 1985 Regulations so that it means Directive 88/407 as amended by Directive 2003/43/EC.<BR><BR>
These Regulations also make amendments to reflect the transfer of functions to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs following the dissolution of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (see the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/794)).<BR><BR>
A Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared and placed in the library of each House of Parliament. Copies can be obtained from Stephen Hall, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 1A Page Street, London, SW1P 4PQ.<BR><BR>
