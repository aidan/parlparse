Rule 27 of the Crown Court Rules 1982 provides that certain matters before the Crown Court may be heard by a judge sitting in Chambers. Those matters are specified in paragraph (2) (a) to (h) of rule 27. Paragraph (2)(c) provides that those matters include applications relating to procedural matters, but do not include an application to vary the place of trial made under section 76(3) of the Supreme Court Act 1981. This reflected the provision of section 76(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (repealed by the Courts Act 2003, s 86, 109(3), Sch 10), that such applications must be heard in open court by a judge of the High Court.<BR><BR>
Following the repeal of section 76(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1981, these Rules amend rule 27 so as to allow an application to vary the place of trial to be heard by a judge in chambers.<BR><BR>
