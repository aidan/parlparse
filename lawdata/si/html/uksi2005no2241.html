<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</b><br/><br/><i>
(This note is not part of the Order)</i></center><br/><br/>
This Order amends the application of the Working Time Regulations 1998 to the police in consequence of the coming into force of section 158 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 ("the 2005 Act").<br/><br/>
Section 158 of the 2005 Act provides that in respect of breaches of health and safety and employment rights legislation a chief officer shall be treated as a corporation sole (a distinct juristic person in Scotland). Where there is personal consent, connivance or neglect on the part of the chief officer they may be prosecuted in a personal capacity. Section 158 came into force upon Royal Assent.<br/><br/>
This Order makes equivalent changes to the Working Time Regulations 1998.<br/><br/>
