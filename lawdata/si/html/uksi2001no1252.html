</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order brings into force further provisions of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 as follows.<BR><BR>
Section 67 and Schedule 6 (which amend the provisions governing powers of investigation for social security purposes) are brought fully into force, along with associated repeals in Part VI of Schedule 9, on 2nd April 2001 (article 2(1)(a) and (e)). Paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 (concerning the payment to an employer of any surplus out of the funds of an occupational pension scheme) is also brought into force on 2nd April 2001 (article 2(1)(c)), as are a number of miscellaneous repeals and revocations of child support provisions (article 2(1)(b) and (d)).<BR><BR>
Section 68 and Schedule 7 except so far as relating to paragraphs 17 and 18(2)(b) of that Schedule, (which make provision for revisions and appeals in connection with housing benefit and council tax benefit), and section 69 (which provides for discretionary assistance with housing) are brought into force on 2nd July 2001, as are the associated repeals in Part VII of Schedule 9, except for certain purposes relating to further reviews of determinations (article 2(2) and (3)).<BR><BR>
An amendment is made in an earlier commencement order to revoke the day previously appointed for the coming fully into force of Part II of Schedule 5 (which provides for an alternative to the anti-franking rules relating to salary related contracted-out pension schemes) (article 3).<BR><BR>
The impact on business of provisions in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 is detailed in the Regulatory Impact Assessment relating to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill (which was introduced in the House of Commons on 1st December 1999). A copy of that Assessment has been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament and can be obtained from the Department of Social Security, Regulatory Impact Unit, 3rd Floor, The Adelphi, 1-11 John Adam Street, London WC2N 6HT.<BR><BR>
