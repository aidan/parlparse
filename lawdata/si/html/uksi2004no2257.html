</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Insurance Companies (Taxation of Reinsurance Business) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/1730)("the Regulations").<BR><BR>
Regulation 1 provides for the citation, commencement and effect of these Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2 introduces the amendments to the Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 amends the definition of P in regulation 3 of the Regulations and expands the definition of "paid" for the purposes of that regulation.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 amends the definition of P in regulation 4, and P<sub>n</sub> in regulation 5 of the Regulations, and expands the meaning of "paid" for the purposes of those provisions. The effect of the amendments, which apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 1<sup>s</sup><sup>t</sup> January 2003, is that, in the computation of sums paid by the cedant insurer to the reinsurer for the purposes of Regulations 4 and 5 of the Regulations, words inserted by the Insurance (Taxation of Reinsurance)(Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/2573) are excluded and the extended definition of "paid" applies.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 revokes regulation 9(4A) and makes a consequential amendment to regulation 9(1).<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 makes revocations in the Insurance (Taxation of Reinsurance)(Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2003 which are consequential on the earlier provisions of this instrument, and revokes the Insurance (Taxation of Reinsurance Business) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/2189), which this instrument replaces.<BR><BR>
A Regulatory Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as it has no impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. The Regulations will, however, have an Exchequer impact as they will prevent the avoidance of tax by the use of financial reinsurance contracts.<BR><BR>
