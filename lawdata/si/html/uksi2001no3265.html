(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These regulations re-enact the Electricity (Standards of Performance) Regulations 1993 with amendments. They prescribe the sum which a relevant supplier or a relevant distributor must pay to a customer by way of compensation for failure to meet specified standards of performance in respect of the services to be provided by such relevant suppliers or relevant distributors. The sum payable differs between domestic and non-domestic customers, and between standards.<BR><BR>
Regulation 19 provides for information to be given to customers and others in relation to the rights prescribed by these Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 20 provides for information to be given to customers and others in relation to the overall standards of performance determined by the Authority under sections 40 and 40A of the Act.<BR><BR>
The Electricity (Standards of Performance) Regulations 1993 are revoked (regulation 2), subject to the transitional provisions in regulation 1.<BR><BR>
