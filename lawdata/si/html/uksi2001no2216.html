Dear [<I>here insert name of parents</I>]<BR><BR>
I am pleased to enclose a copy of [<I>child's name</I>] proposed statement of special educational needs/proposed amended statement of special educational needs. We have attached to it copies of all the advice we were given during [<I>child's name</I>] assessment for the statement.<BR><BR>
If you want to meet us to talk about the statement you need to tell us within 15 days of receiving this letter. This is not the final statement. You can ask for changes to be made to it. The rest of this letter tells you how you can do this.<BR><BR>
As you will see the statement is in six parts:<BR><BR>
Part 1 Introduction<BR><BR>
Part 2 Special Educational Needs<BR><BR>
Part 3 Special Educational Provision, including objectives and monitoring arrangements<BR><BR>
Part 4 Placement<BR><BR>
Part 5 Non-educational Needs<BR><BR>
Part 6 Non-educational Provision<BR><BR>
We have left part 4 blank so that you can tell us where you think [<I>child's name</I>] should be educated. You can tell us which maintained (Local Education Authority) school, including an LEA-maintained special school, you would like [c<I>hild's name]</I> to go to and tell us the reasons. To help you decide, a list of all the maintained [<I>primary/secondary</I>] schools in the area is attached.<BR><BR>
[<I>A list of all primary or secondary schools, depending on whether the child requires primary or secondary education must be attached to this letter</I>].<BR><BR>
If you suggest the name of a maintained school, including a maintained special school, we must name the school in part 4 of the statement unless&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the school is unsuitable to [<I>child's name</I>] age, ability or aptitude or to his/her special educational needs, or<BR><BR>
(b) the attendance of [<I>child's name</I>] at the school would be incompatible with the provision of efficient education for the children with whom he/she would be educated or the efficient use of resources.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
If you think that [<I>child's name</I>] should attend a non-maintained special school or an independent school you can suggest the name of a school and tell us why you think that school should be named in [<I>child's name</I>] statement. A list of non-maintained special schools and independent schools approved by the Secretary of State [<I>and if such a list is produced by the National Assembly of Wales</I>] and the National Assembly of Wales is attached to help you.<BR><BR>
[<I>Such lists of independent and non-maintained special schools as the Secretary of State and the National Assembly of Wales may issue from time to time must be attached to this letter</I>]<BR><BR>
If you want to tell us the name of a school you want [<I>child's name</I>] to go to you must do so within 15 days of getting this letter. However, if you attend a meeting with us to discuss this statement after getting this letter you will have another 15 days from that meeting to suggest a school. You can also tell us if you disagree with what the statement says. If you do disagree with the statement you must also tell us within 15 days of getting this letter, or 15 days from when you meet us to talk about the statement. If you still disagree with the statement, or any of the advice given during the assessment after you meet us, you can ask us for another meeting to discuss the advice you disagree with but you must ask us within15 days of the first meeting. We will arrange for the person who gave the advice, or someone else they suggest, to attend this new meeting. We can arrange more than one meeting if necessary, if you disagree with more than one part of the advice.<BR><BR>
Once all these stages are finished we will send you a final statement that will have part 4 completed.<BR><BR>
If you have any concerns or questions about this process, or disagree with any part of the statement you may wish to get advice or support from the local parent partnership service. They can be contacted at [<I>contact address and telephone number</I>].<BR><BR>
They can also put you in touch with the informal arrangements set up to help resolve or prevent any disagreements between you and the authority. Using either of these services does not prevent you from appealing to the Special Educational Needs Tribunal about Parts 2, 3 or 4 of the Statement at the same time; your rights are not affected and an appeal to the Tribunal can run at the same time as any disagreement resolution.<BR><BR>
When you receive the final statement, if you disagree with parts 2, 3 or 4 you can appeal to the Special Educational Needs Tribunal. The Tribunal can hold a hearing to decide what should be in these parts of [<I>child's name</I>] statement. You have to appeal to the Tribunal within two months of getting the final statement. The address of the Tribunal is 50 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0HW.<BR><BR>

</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations relate to the assessment of special educational needs and to statements of such needs under Part IV of the Education Act 1996. They replace with modifications, and for England only, the Education (Special Educational Needs) Regulations 1994, which are revoked for England (<I>regulation 27</I>).<BR><BR>
The Regulations make provision for a head teacher to delegate his functions under them generally to a qualified teacher, or in a particular case to the staff member who teaches the child (<I>regulation 3</I>).<BR><BR>
The Regulations also supplement the procedural framework for making an assessment and a statement contained in Part IV of the Education Act 1996 and Schedules 26 and 27 thereto. Detailed provision is made for the service of documents by post (<I>regulation 4</I>). The Regulations require copies of notices of a local education authority's proposal to make an assessment, their decision to make an assessment or notices of a parent's or responsible body's request for an assessment, to be served on the social services authority, the health authority and the head teacher of the child's school, or the head of SEN if a child is receiving relevant nursery education (<I>regulation 6</I>). Subject to exceptions, they require local education authorities to carry out various steps in making an assessment or a statement within prescribed time limits, including the provision of prescribed information (<I>regulations 12 and 17 respectively</I>).<BR><BR>
The Regulations provide that local education authorities in making an assessment of a child's special educational needs must seek advice from the child's parent, educational advice, medical advice, psychological advice, advice from the social services authority and any other advice which they consider appropriate for the purpose of arriving at a satisfactory assessment (<I>regulation 7</I>). If such advice has been obtained on making a previous assessment within the last 12 months and certain persons are satisfied that it is sufficient, it is not necessary to obtain new advice (<I>regulation 7(5)</I>). Provision is made as to the persons from whom educational, medical and psychological advice must be sought (<I>regulations 7 to 10</I>). It is provided that in making an assessment an authority shall take into consideration representations from the parent, evidence submitted by the parent, and the advice which has been obtained (<I>regulation 11</I>).<BR><BR>
Provision is made for a child without a statement admitted to a special school for the purpose of an assessment to remain there once the assessment is complete (<I>regulation 13</I>).<BR><BR>
The Regulations prescribe the draft of a notice to be served on a parent with a draft statement of special educational needs or amended statement, or amendment notice (regulations 14 and 15 and Part A and B of Schedule 1 respectively). The form and content of a statement is also prescribed (<I>regulation 16</I>).<BR><BR>
Detailed provision is made as to how an annual review of a statement by a local education authority under section 328 of the Education Act 1996 is to be carried out (<I>regulations 18 to 22</I>). Local education authorities are required to send composite lists of pupils requiring annual reviews to head teachers and health and social services in advance of each term and to the Connexions Service annually (<I>regulation 18</I>). Special provision for reviews is made where the review is the first review after a child has commenced his tenth year of compulsory education. Regulation 20 requires authorities to ensure that statements are amended by 15 February in the year of a child's transfer between phases of his schooling.<BR><BR>
The Regulations provide for the transfer of a statement from one local education authority to another (<I>regulation 23</I>). The duties of the transferor are transferred to the transferee, and within 6 weeks of the transfer the transferee must serve a notice on the parent informing him of the transfer, whether they propose to make an assessment, and when they propose to review the statement (<I>regulation 23(2), (3) and (4)</I>). It is provided that where it would not be practicable to require the transferee to arrange for the child's attendance at a school specified in the statement they need not do so, but can arrange for attendance at another school until it is possible to amend the statement (<I>regulation 23(6)</I>).<BR><BR>
There are restrictions on the disclosure of statements and steps are to be taken to avoid unauthorised persons having access to them (<I>regulation 24</I>).<BR><BR>
Regulation 25 sets out time limits which authorities must comply with orders made by the Special Educational Needs Tribunal, and regulation 26 sets out time limits which authorities must take specified action following their concession of certain appeals to the Tribunal.<BR><BR>
Provision is made from the transition from the regime imposed by the 1994 Regulations to the regime imposed by these Regulations (<I>regulation 28</I>). Broadly, any action taken under the 1994 Regulations can be completed under those regulations. If an assessment has been commenced before 1st September 2001 the local education authority may continue to make the assessment under the 1994 Regulations. However if the assessment is not complete before 1st January 2002 these Regulations will apply to the assessment as if it had been commenced under them on that date (<I>regulation 28(3)</I>).<BR><BR>
