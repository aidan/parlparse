</b><br/><br/><i>
(This note is not part of the Order)</i></center><br/><br/>
This is the fourth Commencement Order made under the Children Act 2004. This Commencement Order brings section 48 of, and paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 6 of Schedule 4 to, the Act together with related repeals into force so far as relating to England on 3rd October 2005. Savings are made in relation to paragraph 6 of Schedule 4.<br/><br/>
Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Schedule 4 amend sections 79E, 79F and 79G of the Children Act 1989 to provide that when an application is made by a person who wishes to be registered as a childminder or as a provider of day care they must pay a fee.<br/><br/>
Paragraph 6 of Schedule 4 amends section 79B(4) of the Children Act 1989 to provide that the provider of day care must make adequate arrangement to ensure that every person (other than himself and the responsible individual) looking after children on the premises is suitable to look after children under the age of 8; and every person (other than himself and the responsible individual) living or working on the premises is suitable to be regular contact with the children under the age of 8. This amendment does not apply to applications for registration which have been made before 3rd October but not determined by that date. It does apply to such providers of day care once their application has been granted.<br/><br/>
