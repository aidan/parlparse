<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations make provision relating to certain aspects of the change of category of schools.<BR><BR>
Section 35 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 provides, in effect, that except for a change of category from voluntary aided school to voluntary controlled school in limited circumstances schools cannot change their category before the end of a prescribed period ("the moratorium period"). Regulation 4 prescribes the moratorium period as the period from 1st September 1999 to 31st August 2000.<BR><BR>
The remainder of the regulations make provision for changes of category from voluntary aided school to voluntary controlled school where in limited circumstances such changes are permitted during the moratorium period. Regulations 5 applies provisions of section 28 of, and Schedule 6 to, the Act with modifications in relation to proposals published to change the category of a school. The modifications are set out in Schedule 1 and the provisions as modified reproduced in Schedule 2. Regulation 6 provides that when considering matters relating to proposals for a change of category each group of members of the school organisation committee shall collectively have a single vote and that decisions must be unanimous.<BR><BR>
Regulations 7 to 9 make provision for implementation of the proposals. Regulation 8 provides for the transfer of staff and regulation 9 with Schedule 3 makes provision for a new instrument of government to be made for the school and for the governing body to be reconstituted in accordance with that instrument.<BR><BR>
Regulation 10 makes special provisions for a period before the school organisation plan for a local education authority has been approved (since during any such period proposals are decided by the Secretary of State rather than the school organisation committee or adjudicator) and regulation 11 makes transitional provisions.<BR><BR>
