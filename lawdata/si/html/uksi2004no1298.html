</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order, together with the European Parliamentary Elections (Local Returning Officers' Charges) Order 2004, provides for payments for services and expenses of returning officers and local returning officers in connection with the conduct of European Parliamentary elections in Great Britain and in Gibraltar.<BR><BR>
Under the European Parliamentary Elections Regulations 2004 ("the 2004 Regulations") the functions of a returning officer at a European Parliamentary election are divided between the returning officer for the electoral region (for whose charges this Order makes provision) and the local returning officer. The latter is responsible for each local counting area wholly or partly within the electoral region. The returning officer's functions are principally in connection with the nomination papers and the allocation of seats, but the arrangements for printing the ballot papers may be made either by him or by the local returning officer.<BR><BR>
Under regulation 15(1) of the 2004 Regulations the entitlement of a returning officer at a European Parliamentary election to recover his charges in respect of his services or expenses for or in connection with such an election depends upon&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the services or expenses being of a kind specified in an order under that provision,<BR><BR>
(b) the services being properly rendered and the expenses being properly incurred, and<BR><BR>
(c) the charges in respect of them being reasonable.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
Part A of the Schedule to this Order specifies the services rendered by a returning officer for or in connection with a European Parliamentary election as a items in respect of which he is entitled to recover his charges, together with the maximum recoverable amounts in respect of those services. Parts B and C of the Schedule specify the kinds of expenses incurred by a returning officer for or in connection with a European Parliamentary election in respect of which he is entitled to recover his charges, together (in the case of Part B) with the maximum recoverable amounts in respect of those charges.<BR><BR>
Parts A and B of the Schedule to this Order increase the maximum recoverable amounts from those that were specified in the European Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers' Charges) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/1378). That Order is revoked by this Order.<BR><BR>
