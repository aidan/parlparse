These Regulations, which extend to England only, further amend the Sweeteners in Food Regulations 1995, which extend to Great Britain, by bringing up to date a reference to Directive 95/31/EC on specific purity criteria so as to cover its amendment by Directive 2000/51/EC insofar as that Directive substituted new specifications for maltitol syrup and by bringing up to date references to the 1995 Regulations in other Regulations.<BR><BR>
No regulatory impact assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations.<BR><BR>
