Article 3 abolishes the existing wards of the district and provides for the creation of 30 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Articles 4 to 7 make electoral changes in the parishes of Cold Ash, Newbury, Thatcham and Tilehurst.<BR><BR>
Article 9 obliges the Electoral Registration Officer to make any necessary amendments to the electoral register to reflect the new electoral arrangements.<BR><BR>
Article 10 revokes articles 9(1), 9(2), 9(3) and 9(7) of the Berkshire (Structural Change) Order 1996 (S.I. 1996/1879).<BR><BR>
