These Regulations, which come into force on 1st September 1999, are made under section 22 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. They make provision for grants by the Secretary of State for postgraduate study at three European institutions: the College of Europe, the European University Institute and the Bologna Centre.<BR><BR>
The requirements for eligibility are broadly the same as those found in the Education (Student Support) Regulations 1999, with minor modifications (regulation 3). In particular eligible students are selected by the Secretary of State on the basis of merit (regulation 3(1)(d)). Applications also follow the provisions of those Regulations (regulation 5).<BR><BR>
Grants for study at the College of Europe cover fees, board and lodging, living costs and certain travel costs (regulation 6). Grants for study at the European Institute cover living costs, provision for dependants, certain travel costs and medical insurance (regulation 7). Grants for study at these two institutions are subject to a means test, broadly the same as that found in the Education (Student Support) Regulations 1999, with minor modifications (regulation 9).<BR><BR>
Grants for study at the Bologna Centre cover fees, and are not means tested (regulation 8).<BR><BR>
