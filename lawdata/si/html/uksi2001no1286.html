Article 8(3) in both the KS1 and KS2 Order is also amended to change the weighting for the attainment targets used to produce a subject level of attainment in mathematics.<BR><BR>
Article 8(4) in both the KS1 and KS2 Order is amended to change the name of the attainment target "experimental and investigative science" to its new name of "scientific enquiry" reflecting changes in the National Curriculum.<BR><BR>
Article 5(3) of the KS3 Order has been amended to change the weightings in English, mathematics, modern foreign language and science for assessment purposes at Key Stage 3 to take account of revisions to the National Curriculum.<BR><BR>
New articles 7 and 9 are substituted in the KS3 Order to reflect changes in the attainment targets relating to technology, art and design, music and physical education.<BR><BR>
