These Regulations amend the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 ("the 1987 Regulations") and the Social Security (Notification of Change of Circumstances) Regulations 2001 ("the 2001 Regulations") in respect of notification of changes of circumstances by benefit recipients.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2 amends the 1987 Regulations to provide that changes of circumstances affecting the continuance of entitlement to benefit or the payment of benefit shall be notified to the Secretary of State in writing or by telephone (unless he requires the person to give written notice or accepts another means of notification) or, if he so requires in a class of case, the changes shall be notified in writing unless he accepts another means of notification in any particular case.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 amends the 2001 Regulations to make similar provision for the purpose of offences relating to failure to notify such changes of circumstances.<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose a charge on business.<BR><BR>
