<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Education (Pupil Information) (England) Regulations 2000 ("the principal Regulations").<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 requires that the head teacher's report to parents and adult pupils be provided free of charge.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 substitutes a new regulation 10 for regulations 10 and 11 of the principal Regulations.<BR><BR>
The new regulation 10 places a duty on the head teacher of the pupil's old school, or, if agreed with the head teacher, the local education authority, to send, no later than fifteen school days after the pupil ceases to be registered at the school, the information in the common transfer form in Schedule 5 and any other educational record to the pupil's new school.<BR><BR>
New regulation 10(3) states that the duties placed on the head teacher or the local education authority by that regulation shall not apply if the head teacher is unable to ascertain the pupil's new school or if the pupil has been registered at the old school for less than four weeks.<BR><BR>
New regulation 10(4) states that, notwithstanding new regulation 10(3), if the head teacher of the pupil's old school receives at any time a request from the head teacher of a school at which the former pupil is now a registered pupil for the information on the common transfer form or any other educational record in the school's possession relating to the pupil, he shall comply with any such request within fifteen school days of receiving it.<BR><BR>
Information on the transfer form may be sent in machine readable form (such as E-Mail or on a floppy disk) or in paper form. If it is in paper form it must be in the format set out in Schedule 5.<BR><BR>
Regulation 8 substitutes a new Schedule 5. The contents of the new Schedule 5 are essentially the same as the old version with minor changes in wording to reflect alterations to the National Curriculum. Changes have also been made to the order and layout of the contents of the forms.<BR><BR>
Other amendments to the principal regulations reflect minor changes to the National Curriculum.<BR><BR>
