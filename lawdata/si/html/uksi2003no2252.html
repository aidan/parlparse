</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Magistrates' Courts Committees (Constitution) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/2395) by omitting regulations 8(2) to (4). By regulation 8(1), as amended, a member of a magistrates' courts committee is appointed to serve for 3 years and shall be eligible for reappointment for similar terms indefinitely. The omission of regulation 8(3) means that a justice is no longer prevented from being appointed to the committee if his name is due to be entered on the supplemental list before the expiry of the 3 year term, and he may be appointed and continue to be a member of the committee until the end of his term.<BR><BR>
