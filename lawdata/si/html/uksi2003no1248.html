<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order is made under section 18 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, which enables an Order in Council to establish categories of registry by reference to which registration of ships in the relevant British possessions (defined in the Act as the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and colonies) may be regulated. The Order does not apply in relation to the registration of small ships or fishing vessels.<BR><BR>
This Order revokes and replaces the Merchant Shipping (Categories of Registries of Relevant British Possessions) Order 1992 as amended ("the 1992 Order as amended"), which was made under section 11 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988.<BR><BR>
In relation to category 2 registries, this Order replaces the previous restrictions relating to ships of 150 tons and passenger ships. It also makes new provision for registration in these registries of pleasure vessels of more than 150 but less than 400 tons, where suitable arrangements for ensuring safety and preventing pollution are in place.<BR><BR>
The relevant British possessions assigned to categories 1 and 2 are unchanged from the 1992 Order as amended.<BR><BR>
