<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note does not form part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Pressure Equipment Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/2001) ("the 1999 Regulations") by providing that pressure equipment that is placed on the market after it has been used otherwise than in the course of business at all times since its manufacture or import shall not be subject to the requirements of the 1999 Regulations relating to placing on the market of such equipment (regulation 2(1)). They also increase the penalty for certain offences created by the 1999 Regulations (regulation 2(2)). Regulation 2(3) corrects a cross-reference in the 1999 Regulations.<BR><BR>
The 1999 Regulations implement Council Directive 97/23/EC (OJ No. L181, 9.7.97, p.1) on the approximation of the laws of the member states concerning pressure equipment ("the Directive"). The Directive was intended only to apply to commercial transactions involving pressure equipment and assemblies, and these Regulations give effect to that intention, as well as amending the enforcement provisions and correcting a cross-reference in the 1999 Regulations. It has therefore not been necessary to prepare a Transposition Note for this instrument.<BR><BR>
