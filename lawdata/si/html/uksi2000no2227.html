</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations modify the Legal Aid Act 1988 so that, where a person appears before a magistrates' court following charge at a police station, criminal legal aid is available to that person without reference to financial resources, and without the need for a statement of means or a contribution to the costs of representation. This modification does not extend to cases where the court sends a person to the Crown Court for trial under the procedure for offences triable only on indictment.<BR><BR>

1988 c. 34; sections 34 and 43 were amended by the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (c. 41), Schedule 18, paragraphs 60 and 63. Section 34(3) confers power to modify the Act for the purposes of its application in prescribed circumstances; section 43 is an interpretation provision and is cited because of the meaning given to "regulations".<a href="#n1">back</a><p>
