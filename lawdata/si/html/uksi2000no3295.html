This Order gives effect, subject to one modification, to recommendations by the Local Government Commission for England for electoral changes in the district of Ashfield. The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on or after 1st May 2003.<BR><BR>
The Secretary of State has decided to retain the site of the former open cast mine known as `Smotherfly', which the Local Government Commission recommended moving to the district ward of Selston, in the district ward of Jacksdale.<BR><BR>
Article 2 abolishes the existing wards of the district and provides for the creation of 15 new wards. That article and Schedule 1 also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 3 makes electoral changes in the parish of Selston.<BR><BR>
Article 4 revokes the District of Ashfield (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1976 and articles 3(1)(b) and 3(2)(b) of the Nottinghamshire (District Boundaries) Order 1988.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new district wards are demarcated on the map described in article 1(3). Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of the Ashfield District Council and at the offices of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 2nd Floor, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE.<BR><BR>
