</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations further amend the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 ("the 1986 Regulations") in relation to brakes. The Regulations make the following changes of substance in addition to minor drafting changes.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 inserts a number of new definitions in the table following regulation 3(2) and amends the existing definition of "Framework Directive" in that table.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 introduces two new exemptions from the requirements in regulation 15(1E) and (5B) concerning anti-lock braking systems ("ABS"). Purpose built vehicles with a maximum design weight of 7500 kg designed and used for street cleansing are exempted from the requirement to have ABS fitted. Vehicles used by a Police Authority which have been authorised by a Chief Constable to perform accident reconstruction duties are exempted from the prohibitions on the use of isolation switches for the operation of ABS.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 amends regulation 15 of the 1986 Regulations (braking systems of certain vehicles first used on or after 1st April 1983) by inserting references to Council Directive 98/12/EC, and the latest version of the United Nations ECE Regulations 13.07, 13.08 and 13.09. This has the effect of extending the categories of vehicles which are required to be fitted with ABS at the point of manufacture to include all passenger-carrying vehicles with more than 8 passenger seats in addition to the drivers, all goods vehicles over 3500 kg and all trailers over 3500kg. This extension will apply to all new vehicles of the relevant kinds first used on or after 1st April 2002. The Road Vehicles (Brake Linings Safety) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/2978) gave effect to Commission Directive 98/12/EC of 27th January 1998. The 1998 Directive lays down standards for asbestos-free brake linings, adapting to technical progress Council Directive 71/320/EEC on the approximation of the laws of Member States relating to the braking devices of certain categories of light motor vehicles and their trailers.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 also introduces a new definition of "date of manufacture" in respect of trailers. The regulation also imposes a requirement for trailers over 8 years old, which are subject to a notifiable alteration or major rebuilding under regulation 30 of the Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) Regulations 1988 (S.I. 1988/1478) (as amended) to be brought up to the latest braking standard applicable at the time of the rebuilding.<BR><BR>
Regulations 6 and 7 amend, respectively, regulation 16 (braking systems of vehicles to which regulation 15 does not apply) and regulation 17 (vacuum or pressure brakes warning devices) by inserting references to Council Directive 98/12/EC and the latest version of the United Nations ECE Regulations 13.07, 13.08 and 13.09.<BR><BR>
Regulation 8 amends regulation 17A by introducing the new British Standard specification BS AU 138b:2000 as an acceptable alternative for couplings used on pneumatic braking systems. Provision has been made for compliance with a corresponding standard.<BR><BR>
Regulation 9 introduces new requirements into regulation 18 of the 1986 Regulations (maintenance and efficiency of brakes) which relates to the electrical connection between a tow vehicle and trailer in order to provide a dedicated power supply to the ABS. The regulation also inserts references to Council Directive 98/12/EC and the latest version of the United Nations ECE Regulations 13.07, 13.08 and 13.09.<BR><BR>
Regulation 10 makes a minor correction to regulation 61A of the 1986 Regulations by deleting the reference to paragraphs (5) to (7) and Schedule 7XA at the beginning of that provision.<BR><BR>
Regulation 11 makes amendments to the tables of Community Directives and United Nations ECE Regulations in Schedule 2 by inserting details of Commission Directive 98/12/EC of 27th January 1998 and ECE Regulations 13.08 and 13.09 in the relevant places.<BR><BR>
Regulation 12 makes amendments to the table in Schedule 3 concerning braking requirements by inserting details of Commission Directive 98/12/EC of 27th January 1998 and United Nations ECE Regulations 13.07, 13.08 and 13.09 in the relevant places.<BR><BR>
