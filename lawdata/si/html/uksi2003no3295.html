These Regulations, which apply to England only, amend the Miscellaneous Food Additives Regulations 1995, as already amended ("the principal Regulations") which apply to the whole of Great Britain.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="2">2.</B>
These Regulations implement European Parliament and Council Directive 2003/52/EC[<a name="n26"><a href="#note26">26</A>] amending Directive 95/2/EC[<a name="n27"><a href="#note27">27</A>] as regards the conditions of use for a food additive E425 Konjac.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="3">3.</B>
These Regulations provide for E425 Konjac to be used in Foodstuffs in general (except in certain foods as are specified in the principal Regulations) but not in jelly confectionery.  Jelly confectionery includes jelly mini-cups.<BR><BR>

A regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared in respect of these Regulations as the instrument will have no effect on the costs of business.  A transposition note setting out how the main elements of Directive 2003/52 are transposed into domestic law has been prepared and placed in the library of each House of Parliament.  Copies may be obtained from the Food Additives Branch, Chemical Safety and Toxicology Division of the Food Standards Agency, Aviation House, 125&nbsp;Kingsway, London WC2B 6NH.<BR><BR>

Functions formerly exercisable by "the Ministers" (being, in relation to England and Wales and acting jointly, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State respectively concerned with health in England and food and health in Wales and, in relation to Scotland, the Secretary of State) are now exercisable in relation to England by the Secretary of State pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 5 to the Food Standards Act 1999 (1999 c. 28), and paragraphs 12(a) and 21 of that Schedule amend respectively sections 17(1) and 48 of the 1990 Act.  Functions of "the Ministers" so far as exercisable in relation to Wales were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales by the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672), as read with section 40(3) of the 1999 Act, and those functions so far as exercisable in relation to Scotland, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (1998 c.&nbsp;46), as read with section 40(2) of the 1999 Act. Regulation 13(4) of the Food Standards Act 1999 (Transitional and Consequential Provisions and Savings) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/656) expressly authorises the Secretary of State to amend or revoke existing Regulations made or having effect as if made by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (whether with others or not) under the Food Safety Act 1990.<a href="#n2">back</a><p>
