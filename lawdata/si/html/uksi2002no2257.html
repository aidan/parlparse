</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The County of Lancashire was divided into five coroners' districts by the Lancashire (Coroners' Districts) Order 1974. Two of these, Blackburn, Hyndburn and Ribble Valley and Blackpool and Fylde, ceased to be part of the jurisdiction of Lancashire by the Lancashire (Boroughs of Blackburn and Blackpool) (Structural Change) Order 1996 and the Lancashire (Coroners) Order 1998, when the unitary authorities of Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen were established.<BR><BR>
This Order creates one new coroner's district out of the existing coroners' districts of North Lancashire and Preston and South West Lancashire. The area of that district, named Preston and West Lancashire is set out in the Schedule to this Order. That Schedule also sets out the remaining coroner's district (East Lancashire) which is wholly inside the County of Lancashire.<BR><BR>
