<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The County of Cornwall was divided into four coroners' districts by the Cornwall (Coroners' Districts) Order 1974. Two of those districts were amalgamated by the Cornwall (Coroners' Districts)(Amendment) Order 1991 and the other two were subsequently amalgamated by the Cornwall (Coroners' Districts)(Amendment) Order 1996 which also renamed the coroner's district created in 1991 and revoked the 1991 Order. The County of Cornwall was thus divided into the East Cornwall coroner's district and the West Cornwall coroner's district.<BR><BR>
This Order amalgamates those two districts to create a single coroner's district. The County of Cornwall therefore now comprises a single coroner's district known as the Cornwall coroner's district.<BR><BR>
