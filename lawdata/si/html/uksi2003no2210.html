These Regulations amend the Non-Domestic Rating (Collection and Enforcement) (Local Lists) Regulations 1989 in relation to England.<BR><BR>
Schedule 2, which contains prescribed forms A, B and C for use by magistrates' courts making a liability order or issuing a warrant committing a debtor to prison, is omitted. Consequential amendments are made to regulations 13(1) and 17(1).<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 revises the levels of certain fees which may be charged in respect of distress. Fees of £20 are increased to £22.50, a fee of £15 is increased to £16.50, a fee of £12.50 to £14 and a fee of £10 to £11. These increases are in line with inflation since 1998 when the fees were last increased.<BR><BR>
