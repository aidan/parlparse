<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the Electricity from Non-Fossil Fuel Sources Saving Arrangements Order 2000 ("the Original Savings Order") and makes certain modifications to section 33 of the Electricity Act 1989 as it has effect in England and Wales.<BR><BR>
It makes provision for the saving of arrangements made by public electricity suppliers in compliance with their obligations under the Original Savings Order. On 1st October 2001 public electricity suppliers cease to exist and their obligations under the Original Savings Order are transferred under article 2(4) of this Order to "supply successor companies".<BR><BR>
Various amendments are also made to replace references in both the Original Savings Order and in section 33 of the Electricity Act 1989 to section 32 of the Electricity Act 1989, which is replaced by new section 32 following the commencement of sections 62 to 65 of the Utilities Act 2000 on 1st October 2001.<BR><BR>
In article 2(8) of this Order provision is made for supply successor companies to be able to change the identity of the "nominated person" who enters into contracts with generators of electricity from non-fossil fuel generating stations.<BR><BR>
In article 2(10) of this Order provision is made for the possibility that supply successor companies may reorganise their company structure or transfer their electricity supply business etc. In such circumstances the Secretary of State may transfer their obligations referred to in article 2(4) of this Order to a third party.<BR><BR>
Article 2(11) provides that section 32 of the Electricity Act 1989 as it extends to England and Wales (as it had effect prior to 1st October 2001) and NFFO Orders 3, 4 &amp; 5 (which are defined in the Original Savings Order) shall continue to have effect.<BR><BR>
Various other consequential and minor amendments are also made to the Original Savings Order and to section 33 of the Electricity Act 1989.<BR><BR>
