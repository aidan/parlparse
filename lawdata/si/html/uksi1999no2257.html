These Regulations revoke the Education (Special Schools) Regulations 1994 and replace them in respect of special schools which are not maintained by a local education authority ("non-maintained special schools"). Provisions relating to maintained special schools are contained in the Education (Maintained Special Schools) (England) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/2212).<BR><BR>
They make provision for the approval of non-maintained special schools by the Secretary of State. They prescribe the requirements which must be observed by such schools in order to be approved and while such approval is in force.<BR><BR>
Provision is made for withdrawal of such approval.<BR><BR>
