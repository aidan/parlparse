The Director General of Fair Trading ("DGFT") is excluded by section 50(3) of the Fair Trading Act 1973 ("FTA") from making monopoly references in respect of specified forms of supply of goods listed in Part II of Schedule 7 of the FTA. These include specified forms of supply of liquid cows' milk and potatoes to which no process of manufacture (other than dressing or dyeing) has been applied. This Order deletes these exclusions. The forms of supply of milk and potatoes covered by these exclusions were the subject of statutory marketing schemes. All the relevant schemes have now been revoked.<BR><BR>
