&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) An election shall, if it has not been previously revoked, cease to have effect when the office holder has made additional contributions for a period equal in length to the period by which the length of his notional service exceeds the total length of his contributions credit.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) An office holder making additional contributions at a rate of 3% shall be treated as making additional contributions for one year for every year that contributions are made at that rate.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) An office holder making additional contributions at a rate other than 3% shall be treated as making additional contributions, for every year that contributions are made at that rate, for a period which bears the same proportion to one year as the rate at which he is making additional contributions bears to 3%.<BR><BR>

These Regulations replace the Judicial Pensions (Contributions) Regulations 1995. They apply for the purposes of prescribing the contributions to be made towards surviving spouse's and children's pensions payable by virtue of the judicial pension scheme set up under Part I of the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993. Regulation 5 provides for members of the scheme to make periodical contributions by way of a deduction from salary. Members who transfer into the Part I scheme from another judicial pension scheme are given a credit for contributions made into the previous schemes and may make additional contributions to cover any shortfall. On ceasing to hold qualifying judicial office, contributions made are compared with contributions due and any necessary adjustment made by way of deduction from the lump sum payable on death or retirement, or by way of refund of contributions, as appropriate.<BR><BR>
