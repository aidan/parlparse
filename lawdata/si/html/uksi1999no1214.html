&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
1.</B>
This proxy paper gives you the right to vote as proxy on behalf of the elector whose name is given above.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
2.</B>
Your appointment as proxy may be for a particular European Parliamentary election only or it may be for an indefinite period. If it is for a particular election, you have the right to vote as proxy only at the election specified in the proxy paper. If it is for an indefinite period, you have the right to vote as proxy at any European Parliamentary election until the electoral registration officer informs you to the contrary.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
3.</B>
When the elector applied for you to be appointed as proxy EITHER he or she was asked to state that he or she had consulted you and that you were capable of being and willing to be appointed as proxy OR you signed a statement stating that you were capable of being and willing to be appointed. You are capable of being appointed as proxy if you are at least 18 years old on polling day, a British or other Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of a Member State of the European Communities and not for any reason disqualified from voting. If for some reason you are not capable of being, or willing to be, appointed as proxy, please write to the elector asking him to cancel the appointment.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
4.</B>
You may vote as proxy at the polling station allotted to the elector on whose behalf you are appointed. However, you may not vote as proxy at the same election for more than two electors of whom you are not the husband, wife, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, child or grandchild. Shortly before polling day you will be sent a proxy poll card telling you where the polling station is. You do not need to take either the poll card or this proxy paper to the polling station but you may find it helpful to do so. Remember that the elector may still vote in person. If he or she applies for a ballot paper at the polling station before you do you will not be able to vote as proxy on his or her behalf.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
5.</B>
If you cannot vote in person at the polling station the electoral registration officer may be able to allow you to vote as proxy by post. [<I>For use in England.</I> If your appointment is for an indefinite period, you may apply to vote by post throughout the period your appointment is in force if you live in a different electoral division (or where there are no electoral divisions, a different parliamentary constituency) from the elector's qualifying address; or if the addresses are in the same electoral division (or, in an area where there are no electoral divisions, parliamentary constituency) but in a different parish.] [<I>For use in Scotland.</I> If your appointment is for an indefinite period, you may apply to vote by post throughout the period your appointment is in force if you live in a different electoral ward from the elector's qualifying address.] [<I>For use in Wales.</I> If your appointment is for an indefinite period, you may vote by post throughout the period your appointment is in force if you live in a different electoral division of a county or county borough from the elector's qualifying address or in a different community.] If you are registered for the same parliamentary constituency or electoral area as the elector, you may apply if you are entitled to vote by post or proxy on your own behalf. In addition, you may vote by post at a particular election if the electoral registration officer is satisfied that you cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person at the elector's polling station. But the electoral registration officer cannot allow an application to vote by post at a particular election if he receives it after 5 p.m. on the eleventh working day before the poll.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations, which replace the Regulations revoked by Schedule 5, apply in Great Britain. They provide for the conduct of European Parliamentary elections under the regional list system of election. That system was introduced by amendments made to the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1978 by the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999.<BR><BR>
The basic structure of the Regulations is to apply with modifications the provisions of the Representation of the People Acts 1983 and 1985 which are listed in the left-hand column of Schedule 1 to these Regulations and the provisions of the Representation of the People Regulations 1986 and the Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 1986 which are listed in the left-hand column of Schedule 2 to these Regulations. The provisions are subject to the general modifications made by regulation 3 and the specific modifications in the right-hand columns of Schedules 1 and 2 to these Regulations. The general modifications convert references to parliamentary elections into references to European Parliamentary elections (regulation 3(4)(b)), references to constituencies into references to electoral regions (regulation 3(4)(c)) and make other similar changes.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 (together with regulation 3(4)(f)) confers functions in relation to the conduct of European Parliamentary elections on the local returning officer, as defined by regulation 2. That officer is the acting returning officer (or, in Scotland, the returning officer) for each parliamentary constituency wholly or partly contained in an electoral region. Regulation 6(1) confers powers on returning officers and local returning officers to delegate their functions.<BR><BR>
As applied by Schedule 1 to these Regulations, sections 67 to 70 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (which concern election agents) apply only in respect of individual candidates. Equivalent provision in respect of registered parties is made by regulations 11 to 14. Regulation 10 requires the appointment of a national election agent for a political party which is registered under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 and stands for election in more than one electoral region at a general election of MEPs.<BR><BR>
As respects such a party, paragraphs (1) and (2) of regulation 15 make provision about the limits on election expenses which is equivalent to that in section 76(1) and (2) of the Representation of the People Act 1983. That provision, as applied, relates only to individual candidates. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of regulation 15 provide for the calculation of the limit of a registered party's election expenditure by reference to the number of electoral regions in which it stands for election. Paragraphs (3) and (4) of regulation 15 provide for that limit where a registered party stands in one electoral region only.<BR><BR>
In the modifications to the 1983 Act, the sum mentioned in section 75(1)(i) is increased from £5 to £5,000 for each electoral region. This change is intended to bring the law into line with a decision of the European Court of Human Rights.<BR><BR>
As applied by Schedule 1 to these Regulations, the grounds on which an election petition may be brought are restricted (section 120, as applied). Section 169 has been modified so that a prosecution in respect of the illegal practice of exceeding the limit on election expenses may  be brought on indictment (and, as such, subject to an unlimited fine).<BR><BR>
