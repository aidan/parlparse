These Regulations, which apply to Great Britain, give effect in part to European Parliament and Council Directive 94/60/EC amending for the fourteenth time Directive 76/769/EEC (OJ No. L262, 27.9.1976, p.201) on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restriction on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 prohibits, subject to exceptions, the placing on the market of wood treated with substances or preparations containing one or more substances listed in the Schedule to these Regulations at more than a specified concentration.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 prohibits, subject to an exception for old treated wood, the use of treated wood in certain circumstances.<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 makes it a criminal offence to contravene any of the prohibitions in regulations 3 and 4 and specifies the penalty.<BR><BR>
The regulations also make a technical amendment to the Environmental Protection (Controls on Hexachloroethane) Regulations 1998. These Regulations apply to Great Britain.<BR><BR>
In Directive 76/769/EEC, substances are identified by reference to their CAS number and EINECS number, shown in each case in the Schedule to these regulations.
