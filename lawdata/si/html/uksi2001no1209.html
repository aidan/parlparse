</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These regulations impose requirements on certain persons employed as teachers in institutions in the further education sector to have qualifications. The requirements will apply to teachers who satisfy the definition of "relevant teacher" in regulation 2 who are employed in institutions in the further education sector after 1st September 2001 who have not previously taught in maintained schools or publicly funded further education institutions (regulation 3(1)). By virtue of section 218(13) of the Education Reform Act 1988 the regulations will apply to persons engaged to provide services as teachers but who do not have contracts of employment, as well as to those employed under contracts of employment.<BR><BR>
Provision is made in regulations 3(2) and (3) and 4 for the levels of qualification and for the time within which the qualification must be obtained.<BR><BR>
The Regulations also make a consequential amendment to the Education (Teachers' Qualifications and Health Standards) (England) Regulations 1999.<BR><BR>
In the case of certain of the qualifications referred to in the Regulations the standard for the qualification is specified by the Secretary of State. Copies of any standards specified may be obtained from the Department for Education and Employment, Public Enquiry Unit, PO Box 12, Runcorn, Cheshire WA7 2GJ; Email: info@dfee.gov.uk.<BR><BR>
