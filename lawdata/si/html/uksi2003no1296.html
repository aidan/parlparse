These Regulations, which extend to England only, amend the Feeding Stuffs (Sampling and Analysis) Regulations 1999 (S.I.&nbsp;1999/1663, as already amended) which extend to the whole of Great Britain, the Feeding Stuffs (Enforcement) Regulations 1999 (S.I.&nbsp;1999/2325, as already amended) which extend to the whole of the United Kingdom and the Feeding Stuffs (Establishments and Intermediaries) Regulations 1999 (S.I.&nbsp;1999/1872, as already amended) which also extend to the whole of the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>

These Regulations implement Commission Directive 2002/70/EC establishing requirements for the determination of levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in feeding stuffs (OJ No.&nbsp;L209, 6.8.2002, p.15).<BR><BR>

These Regulations &nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) amend the Feeding Stuffs (Sampling and Analysis) Regulations 1999 ("the 1999 Regulations") by &nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) inserting into regulation 1(2) a definition of the term "Directive 2002/70/EC" (<I>regulation 3</I>),<BR><BR>
(ii) substituting a revised regulation 3, which makes the requirements as regards the prescribed manner of taking and handling samples, which previously applied only to samples of feeding stuffs, applicable also to feed materials to be sampled pursuant to Directive 2002/70/EC and removes the reference to paragraph 10 of Part II of Schedule 1 to the 1999 Regulations (<I>regulation 4</I>),<BR><BR>
(iii) amending regulation 6 so that it now includes provisions which, when read with provisions added by the Regulations to Schedule 2 to the 1999 Regulations, specify the method of analysis to be used to determine whether dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are present or active in a sample of a feeding stuff or a feed material to be analysed pursuant to Directive 2002/70/EC (and if it is in what quantity or proportion) and apply to that determination specified provisions in Part I of Schedule 2 to the 1999 Regulations (<I>regulations&nbsp;5 and 7</I>), and<BR><BR>
(iv) modifying Part IV of the Agriculture Act 1970 (1970 c. 40, "the 1970 Act") so as to provide that, in order to determine whether dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are present or active in a sample of a feeding stuff or a feed material to be analysed pursuant to Directive 2002/70/EC (and if they are in what quantity or proportion), the sample is to be submitted to and analysed by a laboratory which satisfies specified requirements of that Directive; and making consequential modifications to Parts I and II of Schedule 3 to the 1999 Regulations (<I>regulation 6</I>);<BR><BR>

(b) amend the Feeding Stuffs (Enforcement) Regulations 1999 by &nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) modifying regulation 7 so as to disapply it in relation to regulations 11 and 11A and ensure that it does not become applicable in relation to the new regulation 11B (<I>regulation 9</I>),<BR><BR>
(ii) making consequential and drafting amendments to those Regulations (<I>regulations 10, 11(a) to (c) and 13</I>),<BR><BR>
(iii) providing that samples taken in accordance with section 76(8) of the 1970 Act (as modified for the purposes of those Regulations) are deemed to be taken in the prescribed manner for the purposes of Part IV of that Act (<I>regulation 11(d)</I>),<BR><BR>
(iv) further modifying section 76(9) of the 1970 Act as modified for the purposes of those Regulations by inserting into it a reference to section 76(10) as so modified (<I>regulation 11(e)</I>),<BR><BR>
(v) substituting revised regulations 11 and 11A (which are concerned with analysis for the purposes of sections 77(4) and 78(6) of the 1970 Act), the former being amended to include reference to feed materials to which Annex II to Commission Directive 2002/70/EC applies and the latter being re-enacted with drafting improvements <I>(regulation 12</I>), and<BR><BR>
(vi) inserting a new regulation, 11B, which specifies the circumstances in which, for the purposes of enforcing the Feeding Stuffs Regulations 2000, analysis in relation to samples of feed materials to which Annex II to Directive 2002/70/EC applies is to be treated as carried out in the prescribed manner for the purposes of sections 74(4) and 78(6) of the 1970 Act (<I>regulation 12</I>); and<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
(c) make consequential amendments to the Feeding Stuffs (Establishments and Intermediaries) Regulations 1999 (<I>regulations 14 to 17</I>).<BR><BR>

1970 c. 40.  Section 66(1) contains definitions of the expressions "the Ministers", "prescribed" and "regulations".  The definition of "the Ministers" was amended by the Transfer  of Functions (Wales) (No.&nbsp;1) Order 1978 (S.I.&nbsp;1978/272), Schedule 5, paragraph 1.  Functions of "the Ministers", so far as exercisable in relation to Wales, were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales by S.I.&nbsp;1999/672.  Those functions, so far as exercisable in relation to Scotland, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (1998 c. 46).  By virtue of S.I.&nbsp;1999/3141, functions of the Secretaries of State for Wales and Scotland previously exercisable in relation to England ceased to be so exercisable and were transferred to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<a href="#n1">back</a><p>
