<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order clarifies the description of the limits of the Kent and Essex Sea Fisheries District (created and defined in 1890 by order of the Board of Trade under the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act 1888 (c. 54)) by specifying co-ordinates to assist in the location of particular points of reference (article 2(1)).<BR><BR>
The Order also varies the constitution of the local fisheries committee, originally constituted under the 1890 order, to take account of the changes made to the structure of local government in England under the Local Government Act 1992 (c. 19) and, in particular, under the Kent (Borough of Gillingham and City of Rochester upon Medway) (Structural Change) Order 1996 (S.I. 1996/1876) and the Essex (Boroughs of Colchester, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock and District of Tendring) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996 (S.I. 1996/1875). Provision is made for an increase in the total number of representatives on the committee to twenty-two and for other minor amendments to article 2 of the 1890 order (article 2(2)). Since the number and size of the constituent councils has altered, the number of representatives from each council and their proportionate contributions to the expenses of the committee have also been revised (article 2(3) and Schedule).<BR><BR>
