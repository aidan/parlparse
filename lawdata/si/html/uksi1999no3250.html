This Order makes special provision for the extra charges payable for the hiring of a motor cab licensed in the Metropolitan Police District and the City of London in respect of all journeys beginning and ending there.<BR><BR>
In relation to a hiring which commences or terminates between the hours of 8pm on 31st December 1999 and 6am on 1st January 2000 the normal New Years Eve supplement of £3 does not apply, subject to certain requirements being met.<BR><BR>
A special "Millennium" <I>supplement</I> of £25 or, if less, a sum equal to the aggregate of the standard fare for that hiring based on time and distance and any extra charges payable in respect of additional passengers, luggage and telephone bookings, is payable provided an approved notice setting out how the charge is to be computed is kept prominently displayed in the cab throughout the hiring in such manner as to be clearly legible by the hirer. This extra charge need not be displayed on the taximeter.<BR><BR>
In the case of a hiring in respect of which the notice requirements are not met or which is one accepted under the London Taxi Sharing Scheme, the normal New Year's Eve supplement continues to apply.<BR><BR>
