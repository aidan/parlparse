<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations revoke and re-enact with changes the Allocation of Housing (England) Regulations 2000 to take account of the changes to Part 6 of the Housing Act 1996 ("Part 6") made by the Homelessness Act 2002. These Regulations apply in England only.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 makes provision for cases where the provisions of Part 6 about the allocation of housing accommodation by local housing authorities do not apply.<BR><BR>
By virtue of section 160A(1) and (3) of the 1996 Act, a local housing authority must not allocate housing accommodation to persons from abroad who are subject to immigration control within the meaning of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 (c. 49) unless otherwise prescribed. Regulation 4 prescribes classes of persons subject to immigration control who are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation.<BR><BR>
Persons from abroad not subject to immigration control who are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation may be prescribed as ineligible under Part 6.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 prescribes a class of persons who are ineligible under that Part. Regulation 6 revokes the Allocation of Housing (England) Regulations 2000.<BR><BR>
These Regulations, with minor drafting changes, contain similar provisions to those in the Allocation of Housing (England) Regulations 2000. Those Regulations which have not been re-enacted relate to the restrictions on the allocation to existing tenants and to the requirements to establish, maintain and operate a housing register, which have now been repealed.<BR><BR>
