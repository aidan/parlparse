This Order, which comes into force on 1st June 2004, amends sections 36C to 36F of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 (c. 4).<BR><BR>
Sections 36A to 36H apply reduced rates of excise duty for beer from small breweries producing up to 30,000 hectolitres of beer a year. Section 36B is a definitions section. Section 36C defines what is small-brewery beer in the case of a singleton brewery and section 36D sets the rate of duty for small-brewery beer from singleton breweries. Section 36E defines what is small-brewery beer when produced by a co-operated brewery while section 36F sets the rate of duty for small-brewery beer from a co-operated brewery.<BR><BR>
The rate of duty for small-brewery beer produced by breweries with an annual production of more than 5,000 hectolitres and up to 30,000 hectolitres, is calculated using a formula. The formula is specified in section 36D for singleton breweries and in section 36F for co-operated breweries.<BR><BR>
This Order amends sections 36C to 36F to apply reduced rates of excise duty for beer from small breweries producing up to 60,000 hectolitres of beer a year. For breweries producing more than 30,000 hectolitres and up to 60,000 hectolitres, the reduced rate is applied on a tapered basis and is calculated using a new formula. The new formula is specified in section 36D for singleton breweries and in section 36F for co-operated breweries.<BR><BR>
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no impact on the costs of business, charities or voluntary bodies.<BR><BR>
