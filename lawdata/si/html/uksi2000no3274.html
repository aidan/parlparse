</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Vehicle Excise Duty (Reduced Pollution) Regulations 1998.<BR><BR>
The Regulations amend the rate and content of particulate emissions requirements with which a relevant vehicle must comply in order to satisfy the reduced pollution requirements. The amended requirements reflect the particulate emission levels contained in Directive 1999/96/EC. However, the existing requirements are retained for vehicles for which a reduced pollution certificate had been issued before the coming into force of these Regulations.<BR><BR>
The Regulations also provide for the issue of replacement certificates and for the signing of certificates and written notices on behalf of authorised examiners. They amend an incorrect cross reference in regulation 12 of the principal Regulations.<BR><BR>
