<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order, which comes into force on 1st September 1999, revokes the Redundancy Payments (Local Government) (Modification) Order 1983 and the subsequent orders which amended it, and consolidates their provisions, with further amendments, into a single order.<BR><BR>
The Order modifies certain provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996 concerning redundancy payments, in their application to persons employed by certain local government employers or other employers in related sectors. The modifications have the effect that the employment of such a person by more than one such employer may be treated as if it were continuous for the purposes of those provisions; and re-engagement of such a person, or an offer of re-engagement made to such a person, by any such employer is treated as if it were re-engagement, or as if the offer had been made, by that person's employer.<BR><BR>
In addition to consolidating the provisions of the revoked orders with drafting amendments, the Order incorporates additions to and removals from the lists of employers concerned, arising from changes in the way local government services and services in the related sectors are provided and in the identities of the employers involved.<BR><BR>
