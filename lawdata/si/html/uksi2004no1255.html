<B>
1.1.</B>
<B>
<B>Complete nuclear reactors</B></B><BR>
Nuclear reactors capable of operation so as to maintain a controlled self-sustaining fission chain reaction, excluding zero energy reactors, the latter being defined as reactors with a designed maximum rate of production of plutonium not exceeding 100 grams per year.<BR><BR>

<B>
<B>PLANTS FOR THE REPROCESSING OF IRRADIATED FUEL ELEMENTS, AND EQUIPMENT ESPECIALLY DESIGNED OR PREPARED THEREFOR</B></B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
INTRODUCTORY NOTE</B><BR>
Reprocessing irradiated nuclear fuel separates plutonium and uranium from intensely radioactive fission products and other transuranic elements. Different technical processes can accomplish this separation. However, over the years Purex has become the most commonly used and accepted process. Purex involves the dissolution of irradiated nuclear fuel in nitric acid, followed by separation of the uranium, plutonium, and fission products by solvent extraction using a mixture of  tributyl phosphate in an organic diluent.<BR><BR>
Purex facilities have process functions similar to each other, including: irradiated fuel element chopping, fuel dissolution, solvent extraction, and process liquor storage. There may also be equipment for thermal denitration of uranium nitrate, conversion of plutonium nitrate to oxide or metal, and treatment of fission product waste liquor to a form suitable for long term storage or disposal. However, the specific type and configuration of the equipment performing these functions may differ between Purex facilities for several reasons, including the type and quantity of irradiated nuclear fuel to be reprocessed and the intended disposition of the recovered materials, and the safety and maintenance philosophy incorporated into the design of the facility.<BR><BR>
A "plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements" includes the equipment and components which normally come in direct contact with and directly control the irradiated fuel and the major nuclear material and fission product processing streams.<BR><BR>
These processes, including the complete systems for plutonium conversion and plutonium metal production, may be identified by the measures taken to avoid criticality (e.g. by geometry), radiation exposure (e.g. by shielding), and toxicity hazards (e.g. by containment).<BR><BR>
Items of equipment that are considered to fall within the meaning of the phrase "and equipment especially designed or prepared" for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements include:<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
3.1.</B>
<B>
<B>Irradiated fuel element chopping machines</B></B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
INTRODUCTORY NOTE</B><BR>
This equipment breaches the cladding of the fuel to expose the irradiated nuclear material to dissolution. Especially designed metal cutting shears are the most commonly employed, although advanced equipment, such as lasers, may be used.<BR><BR>
Remotely operated equipment especially designed or prepared for use in a reprocessing plant as identified above and intended to cut, chop or shear irradiated nuclear fuel assemblies, bundles or rods.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
3.2.</B>
<B>
<B>Dissolvers</B></B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
INTRODUCTORY NOTE</B><BR>
Dissolvers normally receive the chopped-up spent fuel. In these critically safe vessels, the irradiated nuclear material is dissolved in nitric acid and the remaining hulls removed from the process stream.<BR><BR>
Critically safe tanks (e.g. small diameter, annular or slab tanks) especially designed or prepared for use in a reprocessing plant as identified above, intended for dissolution of irradiated nuclear fuel and which are capable of withstanding hot, highly corrosive liquid, and which can be remotely loaded and maintained.<BR><BR>
&hellip;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
3.4.</B>
<B>
<B>Chemical holding or storage vessels</B></B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
INTRODUCTORY NOTE</B><BR>
Three main process liquor streams result from the solvent extraction step. Holding or storage vessels are used in the further processing of all three streams, as follows:<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) The pure uranium nitrate solution is concentrated by evaporation and passed to a denitration process where it is converted to uranium oxide. This oxide is re-used in the nuclear fuel cycle.<BR><BR>
(b) The intensely radioactive fission products solution is normally concentrated by evaporation and stored as a liquor concentrate. This concentrate may be subsequently evaporated and converted to a form suitable for storage or disposal.<BR><BR>
(c) The pure plutonium nitrate solution is concentrated and stored pending its transfer to further process steps. In particular, holding or storage vessels for plutonium solutions are designed to avoid criticality problems resulting from changes in concentration and form of this stream.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
Especially designed or prepared holding or storage vessels for use in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. The holding or storage vessels must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric acid. The holding or storage vessels are normally fabricated of materials such as low carbon stainless steels, titanium or zirconium, or other high quality materials. Holding or storage vessels may be designed for remote operation and maintenance and may have the following features for control of nuclear criticality:<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) walls or internal structures with a boron equivalent of at least two per cent, or<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) a maximum diameter of 175 mm (7 in) for cylindrical vessels, or<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) a maximum width of 75 mm (3 in) for either a slab or annular vessel.<BR><BR>

<B>
<B>Gas centrifuges and assemblies and components especially designed or prepared for use in gas centrifuges</B></B><BR>
  <BR><BR>
<B>
INTRODUCTORY NOTE</B><BR>
The gas centrifuge normally consists of a thin-walled cylinder(s) of between 75 mm (3 in) and 400 mm (16 in) diameter contained in a vacuum environment and spun at high peripheral speed of the order of 300 m/s or more with its central axis vertical. In order to achieve high speed the materials of construction for the rotating components have to be of a high strength to density ratio and the rotor assembly, and hence its individual components, have to be manufactured to very close tolerances in order to minimize the unbalance. In contrast to other centrifuges, the gas centrifuge for uranium enrichment is characterized by having within the rotor chamber a rotating disc-shaped baffle(s) and a stationary tube arrangement for feeding and extracting the UF<sub>6</sub> gas and featuring at least 3 separate channels, of which 2 are connected to scoops extending from the rotor axis towards the periphery of the rotor chamber. Also contained within the vacuum environment are a number of critical items which do not rotate and which although they are especially designed are not difficult to fabricate nor are they fabricated out of unique materials. A centrifuge facility however requires a large number of these components, so that quantities can provide an important indication of end use.<BR><BR>

Liquid-liquid centrifugal contactors especially designed or prepared for uranium enrichment using the chemical exchange process. Such contactors use rotation to achieve dispersion of the organic and aqueous streams and then centrifugal force to separate the phases. For corrosion resistance to concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions, the contactors are made of or are lined with suitable plastic materials (such as fluorocarbon polymers) or are lined with glass. The stage residence time of the centrifugal contactors is designed to be short (30 seconds or less).<BR><BR>

INTRODUCTORY NOTE</B><BR>
Present systems for enrichment processes using lasers fall into two categories: those in which the process medium is atomic uranium vapor and those in which the process medium is the vapor of a uranium compound. Common nomenclature for such processes include: first category&nbsp;-&nbsp;atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS or SILVA); second category&nbsp;-&nbsp;molecular laser isotope separation (MLIS or MOLIS) and chemical reaction by isotope selective laser activation (CRISLA). The systems, equipment and components for laser enrichment plants embrace: (a) devices to feed uranium-metal vapor (for selective photo-ionization) or devices to feed the vapor of a uranium compound (for photo-dissociation or chemical activation); (b) devices to collect enriched and depleted uranium metal as "product" and "tails" in the first category, and devices to collect dissociated or reacted compounds as "product" and unaffected material as "tails" in the second category; (c) process laser systems to selectively excite the uranium-235 species; and (d) feed preparation and product conversion equipment. The complexity of the spectroscopy of uranium atoms and compounds may require incorporation of any of a number of available laser technologies.<BR><BR>

(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations require persons engaged in specific nuclear and nuclear-related activities to give certain details about themselves and those activities to the Secretary of State. The United Kingdom is required to provide certain information in relation to nuclear and nuclear-related activities to the International Atomic Energy Agency ("IAEA") pursuant to the Additional Protocol referred to in section 1(1) of the Nuclear Safeguards Act 2000. These Regulations enable the Secretary of State to know who may have such information.<BR><BR>
Regulations 3 and 4 provide that a person who has carried out any of the activities referred to in the respective paragraphs of those regulations, supplemented by the Schedule, must notify the Secretary of State. The activities referred to are those specified in the Additional Protocol about which information is required to be given by the Secretary of State to the IAEA, but which may be carried on without the Secretary of State knowing other than as a result of compliance with these Regulations. The relevant provisions from the Additional Protocol are reproduced in Part II of the Schedule.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 negates the obligation to notify the Secretary of State where the Secretary of State already has the details which that person would otherwise have to give under the Regulations, and serves on that person a written notice setting out those details. Such a person must still notify the Secretary of State if the details set out in the notice are incomplete or wrong, or if they change.<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 describes what details a person has to give when notifying the Secretary of State under regulation 3 or 4.<BR><BR>
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no impact on the costs of business.<BR><BR>
