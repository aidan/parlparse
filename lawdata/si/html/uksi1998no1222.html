(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations, which are made under sections 484, 485 and 489 of the Education Act 1996, authorise the Secretary of State to pay grants in connection with expenditure approved by the Secretary of State in relation to&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) projects ("partnership projects") in which a group of schools, which must include at least one independent school and one maintained school, co-operate with each other (and other persons or organisations) with a view to expanding educational opportunities and improving educational standards for the pupils attending such schools <I>(regulation 3)</I>; or<BR><BR>
(b) research into partnership projects <I>(regulation 5)</I>.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
Partnership grant is payable to the organiser of the project who may be a local education authority or another person (although not the governing body of a maintained school). The organiser may disburse grants to third parties who incur approved expenditure in relation to a project, in particular schools participating in a project <I>(regulation 4)</I>.<BR><BR>
In relation to partnership grant, the rate of grant will be 100% of approved expenditure where the project organiser is an LEA, otherwise grant may be such proportion of the approved expenditure as is determined by the Secretary of State; and grant is payable at such times and in such instalments as he may determine <I>(regulations 6 and 7)</I>.<BR><BR>
The payment of grant may be made dependent upon such conditions as may be specified by the Secretary of State, and he may also require the person to whom it is paid to comply with certain requirements <I>(regulations 8 and 9)</I>.<BR><BR>
