<B>
<a name="3">3.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) Each supply successor company shall ensure that before the 30th day following the commencement of the order period it has produced evidence to the Authority that it has made arrangements to secure that the Requirements are complied with.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Each supply successor company shall be under a duty at all times during the order period to secure that the Requirements are complied with and shall not by any act or omission of his prevent any new arrangements from securing the result mentioned in article 4(1)(b).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Each supply successor company shall supply the Authority with such information, or with information of a particular kind, requested by the Authority and which in its opinion is relevant to the question whether it is discharging, or has discharged, its obligations in this Order.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) No person shall be required by virtue of this article to provide any information which he could not be compelled to give in evidence in civil proceedings in the Court of Session.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Within 45 days after the commencement of the order period (or such later or additional dates as the Secretary of State may consider necessary) the Authority shall report to the Secretary of State the extent to which it is satisfied that the supply successor companies have complied with their obligation in article 3(1).<BR><BR>
<B>
The Requirements - duties of the supply successor company</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="4">4.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) The Requirements are that&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the supply successor company must by the commencement of the order period have made arrangements ("the new arrangements") which replace (in so far as it is necessary to comply with this Order) the original arrangements but with the supply successor company replacing the relevant public electricity supplier as contracting party to those arrangements in each case;<BR><BR>
(b) subject to paragraph (2) below, the new arrangements must secure that there is available to the supply successor company from the non-fossil fuel generating stations described in SRO Orders 1, 2 and 3 the aggregate amount of generating capacity which, immediately before the commencement of the order period, was required by those SRO Orders 1, 2 and 3 to have been available to the relevant public electricity supplier during the order period;<BR><BR>
(c) having entered into the new arrangements, the supply successor company must not by any act or omission of his prevent those arrangements made by him from securing the result mentioned in sub-paragraph (b) above;<BR><BR>
(d) the new arrangements must be on terms such that generators who are party to them are in substantially the same economic position as regards matters relating to contract price, indexation, timing and term under those new arrangements as they had been in as party to the original arrangements.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The amount of generating capacity required by article 4(1)(b) to be available to the supply successor company shall be reduced in the same manner that article 4 of the SRO Order 2 reduced the amount of generating capacity required to be made available to the relevant public electricity supplier by that Order, but the reduction in generating capacity provided for in this paragraph shall be calculated by reference to any adapted conditions instead of by reference to the conditions precedent and termination events set out in Schedules 2 and 3 to the SRO Order 2.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of this article an "adapted condition" means a condition set out in the new arrangements which has broadly equivalent effect to a provision contained in Schedule 2 or 3 to the SRO Order 2 taking into account the fact that it is the supply successor company, not a public electricity supplier, who enters into the new arrangements.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any case of dispute as to whether a condition in the new arrangements is an "adapted condition" may be referred to and determined by the Secretary of State on application by either the supply successor company or a generator who is party to those new arrangements.<BR><BR>
<B>
Deemed imposition of new arrangements</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="5">5.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) If, by the commencement of the order period, any generator has not entered into the new arrangements with the supply successor company the generator shall be deemed to&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) have entered into an agreement with the supply successor company on and with effect from the first day of the order period on those terms last offered to him in writing by the supply successor company prior to the commencement of the order period, to the extent that those terms comply with all requirements of this Order in relation to new arrangements; and<BR><BR>
(b) have terminated the original arrangements to which he was a party (without prejudice to any rights or liabilities existing prior to such termination), with termination having effect immediately before he is deemed to have entered into the agreement referred to in this article.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where paragraph (1) above applies, the supply successor company shall notify the generator in writing within 14 days after the commencement of the order period of the terms of the agreement which are deemed to apply to him.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Any dispute as to whether the terms of the agreement referred to above comply with the requirements of this Order in relation to the new arrangements may be referred to and determined by the Secretary of State where application to the Secretary of State has been made in writing within three months after the commencement of the order period. In making his determination under this article the Secretary of State may give such directions to the supply successor company or the generator as appear to him to be appropriate for varying the terms of the agreement so that they comply with the requirements of this Order in relation to the new arrangements.<BR><BR>
<B>
Replacement supply successor companies</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="6">6.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) A supply successor company (referred to as "the Company" in this article) shall notify the Secretary of State in writing immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events and such notification shall include the identity of any relevant third parties as referred to in sub-paragraphs (f) and (h):<BR><BR>

(h) the Company makes arrangements to transfer all or part of its electricity supply business to a third party.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where it appears to either the Secretary of State or to the Authority that in relation to the Company any of the events listed in paragraph (1) has taken or will take place the Secretary of State may transfer all or part of the obligations of the Company under this Order to any third party (including any other existing supply successor company) who appears to the Secretary of State to have taken over, continued or to have had transferred to it all or part of the electricity supply business or the supply licence of the Company.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the circumstances described in paragraph (2) the Secretary of State shall notify the relevant third party and the Company in writing of the transfer of obligations under this Order and such third party shall, with effect from a date specified by the Secretary of State, become a supply successor company and shall take over all or part of the obligations of the Company under this Order, as specified by the Secretary of State.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order makes provision for the saving and modification of arrangements which have been made by public electricity suppliers in compliance with section 32 of the Electricity Act 1989 ("the Electricity Act") to coincide with the licence split under the Utilities Act 2000. It also saves section 32 and modifies section 33 of the Electricity Act.<BR><BR>
Articles 1 and 2 provide for the citation, commencement, extent and interpretation of the Order. The Order comes into force on 1st October 2001.<BR><BR>
Articles 3 and 4 oblige the supply successor companies in Scotland to make arrangements which replace arrangements which were made in the past by public electricity suppliers in compliance with section 32 of the Electricity Act and which secure the availability of a certain amount of generating capacity from non-fossil fuel generating stations. The amount of generating capacity which is to be made available to the supply successor companies is the same as that which was required to be made available to the public electricity suppliers. The arrangements made by the supply successor companies must be in place by 1st October 2001.<BR><BR>
Article 5 imposes agreements on operators of non-fossil fuel generating stations who had an arrangement making electricity available to public electricity suppliers in compliance with certain orders under section 32 of the Electricity Act, but who have not entered into replacement arrangements with the supply successor companies. There is a provision for the Secretary of State to resolve disputes as to the terms of such imposed agreements.<BR><BR>
In article 6 provision is made for the possibility that supply successor companies may reorganise their company structure or transfer their electricity supply business etc. In such circumstances the Secretary of State may transfer their obligations under this Order to a third party.<BR><BR>
Article 7 saves section 32 of the Electricity Act for the purposes of this Order.<BR><BR>
Article 8 provides that the obligations of the supply successor companies under this Order are to be treated as relevant requirements for the purposes of Part I of the Electricity Act thus enabling the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to take enforcement action.<BR><BR>
Article 9 makes various amendments to section 33 of the Electricity Act with effect from 1st October 2001. The amendments to section 33 are largely to enable payments of fossil fuel levy to be paid to the supply successor companies instead of to public electricity suppliers. No changes are to be made to the way in which the payment of the fossil fuel levy is to be calculated. Various consequential amendments are also made which largely replace references to public electricity suppliers with references to the supply successor companies. There is provision for regulations made under section 33 of the Electricity Act to make transitional provision to allow for payments of fossil fuel levy to continue to be made to public electricity suppliers where they were entitled to such payments before the amendments to section 33 were made by this Order.<BR><BR>
