These Regulations amend the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (Tradepoint) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2051). The purpose of the amendments is to reflect the transfer of all the business of Tradepoint Financial Networks plc (now known as virt-x plc) as a recognised investment exchange to a wholly owned subsidiary, virt-x Exchange Limited. The transfer of business is effective from 25th June 2001 and, accordingly, these Regulations come into force on that date.<BR><BR>
