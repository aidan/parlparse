Regulations 2(4)(b), 2(5)(c), 3(4)(b), 3(5)(c), 4(5)(b), 4(6)(d), 5(4)(b), 5(5)(d) and 6(2) amend the principal sets of regulations and the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (State Pension Credit) Regulations 2003 to clarify the extent of income and capital disregards in relation to the scheme known as "supporting people".<BR><BR>
Regulations 2(5)(a) and (b), 3(5)(a) and (b), 4(6)(b) and (c) and 5(5)(b) and (c) amend the principal sets of regulations to reflect changes to court procedure following the introduction of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 in England and Wales and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 in Scotland.<BR><BR>
Regulations 2(5)(d), 3(5)(d), 4(6)(e) and 5(5)(e) add to the capital disregards in the principal sets of regulations payments made to a claimant in respect of community care services.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4(3) amends references to the scheme known as "supporting people" in relation to the circumstances in which the costs of cleaning exterior windows and communal areas of a claimant's accommodation can be met by housing benefit under the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987.<BR><BR>
Regulations 4(6)(a) and 5(5)(a) amend the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 and the Council Tax Benefit (General) Regulations 1992 to remove the capital disregard for arrears of council tax benefit and housing benefit respectively.<BR><BR>
These Regulations do not impose a charge on business.<BR><BR>
