</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order gives effect, with one modification, to recommendations by the Boundary Committee for England, a committee of the Electoral Commission, for electoral changes in the borough of Christchurch.<BR><BR>
The modification relates to the boundary between the North Highcliffe and Walkford borough ward and the West Highcliffe borough ward.<BR><BR>
The changes have effect in relation to local government elections to be held on and after 1st May 2003.<BR><BR>
Article 3 abolishes the existing wards of the borough and provides for the creation of 11 new wards. That article and the Schedule also make provision for the names and areas of, and numbers of councillors for, the new wards.<BR><BR>
Article 5 obliges the Electoral Registration Officer to make any necessary amendments to the electoral register to reflect the new electoral arrangements.<BR><BR>
Article 6 revokes the Borough of Christchurch (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1978 (S.I. 1978/1841), with the exception of article 8.<BR><BR>
The areas of the new borough wards are demarcated on the map described in article 2. Prints of the map may be inspected at all reasonable times at the offices of Christchurch Borough Council and at the principal office of the Electoral Commission at Trevelyan House, Great Peter Street, London SW1P 2HW.<BR><BR>
