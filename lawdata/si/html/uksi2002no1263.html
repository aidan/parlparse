&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If the Committee declares that in its opinion there has been a material error or irregularity in the conduct of the election which has affected the outcome of the election, the result of the election previously notified under rule 8(3) shall be treated as ineffective for the purposes of this Part in the constituency concerned and a further election in that constituency or a further count of the affected votes (as directed by the Committee) shall be held as soon as practicable thereafter.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If the Committee declares that in its opinion there has not been such a material error or irregularity, the persons elected in the constituency concerned shall resume as or become (as the case may be) members of the Council upon the declaration of that opinion or, if later, upon the vacancies concerned having effect.<BR><BR>

"transferable voting paper" means a voting paper which, having been taken into account in establishing the vote of a candidate who has been eliminated or treated as elected, shows a next available preference for a continuing candidate (and "non-transferable voting paper" means a voting paper which does not show such a next available preference).</UL><P>

Manner of voting</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
2.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) Each person exercising a vote shall have one transferable vote only.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Each such person, in recording his vote on the voting paper in respect of a transferable vote&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) must place on the voting paper for that vote the figure 1 opposite the name of one candidate for whom he wishes to vote and wishes to give first preference; and<BR><BR>
(b) may indicate the order of his preference for as many other candidates as he pleases by placing against their respective names the figures 2, 3 and so forth, the figure indicating the order of preference.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
<B>
The start of the count</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
3.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) The count shall begin by the Election Scrutineer examining the voting papers and sorting them into parcels according to the first preference recorded for each candidate, rejecting any that are invalid.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Election Scrutineer shall then count the papers in each parcel and shall credit each candidae with a value of votes equal to the number of valid papers on which a first preference has been recorded for that candidate.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The quota for the election shall then be determined by dividing the total number of valid votes on which a first preference has been recorded determined under sub-paragraph (2) by one more than the number of places to be filled, the result being rounded up if not exact to the next whole number above.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any candidates who are credited with a value of votes equal to, or exceeding, the quota shall be treated as duly elected in descending order of votes, so far as the number of candidates so elected does not exceed the number of vacancies to be filled.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where the number of candidates duly elected under sub-paragraph (4) are less than the number of vacancies to be filled, the Election Scrutineer shall proceed to defer or transfer the surpluses of those candidates (if any) under paragraph 4 and, so far as necessary after any such surpluses have been deferred or transferred, to exclude candidates under paragraph 6.<BR><BR>
<B>
Transfers of surpluses</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
4.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) If one or more candidates have surpluses above the quota (including any previously deferred under this sub-paragraph awaiting transfer), and the total value of such surpluses does not exceed either&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the difference between the value of votes held by the candidate with the smallest value of votes and the value of votes held by the candidate with the next smallest value of votes, or<BR><BR>
(b) the difference between the total value of votes held by the two or more candidates with the smallest value of votes who could be excluded pursuant to paragraph 6 and the value of votes held by the candidate with the next smallest value of votes,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
the transfers of such surpluses shall be deferred.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Otherwise, if one or more candidates have surpluses (including any previously deferred surpluses awaiting transfer), the largest surplus shall be transferred in accordance with paragraph 5.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the two or more candidates with the largest surpluses have equal surpluses, the surplus of the candidate who holds the largest value of votes at the earliest stage at which they had an unequal value of votes shall be transferred; or if such two or more candidates held the same number of votes at all stages of the count, the matter shall be determined by lot (to be drawn by the Election Scrutineer).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) After a transfer under sub-paragraph (2) or (3), subject to paragraph 8(2), sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) above shall be applied consecutively to any further surpluses in descending order of the amount of the surpluses, the distribution of each surplus comprising a separate stage.<BR><BR>
<B>
Calculation of transfer values of surpluses</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
5.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) In the case of a surplus arising by virtue of a candidate being duly elected under paragraph 3(4) upon the counting of first preference votes, all the voting papers received by the candidate shall be examined by the Election Scrutineer.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In the case of a surplus arising at a later stage consequential on the transfer of another surplus or from the exclusion of a candidate or candidates, only the last parcel of voting papers transferred to the candidate duly elected which gave rise to the surplus shall be examined by the Election Scrutineer.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The voting papers to be examined shall be sorted into sub-parcels according to next available preferences for continuing candidates, any voting papers on which no next available preference is expressed being set aside as non-transferable.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If the total present value of all the transferable voting papers examined under sub-paragraph (1) or (2) at the current stage exceeds the surplus, the transfer value of each such voting paper shall be equal to an amount found by dividing the surplus by the number of such voting papers to two decimal places, ignoring any remainder beyond that (except that the value of any individual voting paper may not increase at any stage of the count); and in any other case the transfer value of each voting paper shall be its present value.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Each continuing candidate shall then be credited with the transfer value of any voting papers examined under sub-paragraph (1) or (2) with respect to which he is indicated as the next available preference, and any candidate who in consequence holds a value of votes equal to or exceeding&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the quota, or<BR><BR>
(b) the total active vote divided by one more than the number of vacancies remaining to be filled,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
shall be treated as duly elected (subject to paragraph 8(3)).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The surpluses arising at the current stage in respect of the candidates duly elected under sub-paragraph (5) shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 4.<BR><BR>
<B>
Exclusion of candidates</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
6.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) If, at the end of any stage, all surpluses falling to be transferred or deferred under paragraph 4 have been so transferred or deferred, and one or more vacancies remain to be filled, then the candidates falling within sub-paragraph (2) shall be excluded, and the present value of the voting papers of all the excluded candidates falling within that sub-paragraph shall be dealt with together under paragraph 7.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The candidates to be excluded shall be&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the candidate holding the smallest value of votes ("the bottom candidate"), and<BR><BR>
(b) in ascending order of votes, such other candidates (if any) above the bottom candidate as have, taken together with all the other candidates to be excluded, a total value of votes which, when added to the value of any deferred surpluses, does not exceed the value of votes held by the candidate with the next smallest value of votes above them;<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
save that no candidate shall be excluded if the exclusion leaves insufficient continuing candidates to fill the number of vacancies remaining.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If two or more candidates hold the same value of votes, and in applying the rules in sub-paragraph (2) not all of them could be excluded if the sub-paragraph were applied to each in turn (and assuming that sub-paragraph (2)(a) could only apply to one of them), then the candidates (equal in number to the number of candidates which could be so excluded) who had in order the smallest value of votes at the earliest stage at which they held an unequal value of votes shall be excluded, or if such two or more candidates held the same value of votes at all stages of the count so that the matter cannot be determined, then the matter shall be determined by lot (to be drawn by the Election Scrutineer).<BR><BR>
<B>
Transfers on exclusion of candidates</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
7.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) Where a candidate or candidates have been excluded under paragraph 6, the voting papers held by the excluded candidate or candidates in question shall be arranged together in parcels in descending order of present value.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The parcel containing the voting papers which are of the highest individual present value shall be sorted into sub-parcels according to next available preferences for continuing candidates, any voting papers on which no next available preference is expressed being set aside as non-transferable.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Each continuing candidate shall be credited with the present value of any voting papers with respect to which he is indicated as the next available preference.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any candidate who now holds a value of votes equal to or exceeding&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the quota, or<BR><BR>
(b) the total active vote divided by one more than the number of vacancies remaining to be filled,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
shall be treated as duly elected (subject to paragraph 8(3)).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Any remaining parcels of voting papers shall be sorted and transferred in turn in descending order of present value in the same way, and candidates treated as duly elected where appropriate.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Upon that being completed, the surpluses arising in respect of the candidates duly elected under sub-paragraph (4) shall then be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 4.<BR><BR>
<B>
Termination of count</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
8.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) If at any stage, as a result of the proposed exclusion of one or more candidates, the number of continuing candidates would be equal to the number of places remaining to be filled, such continuing candidates shall be treated as duly elected.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If at any stage the number of candidates duly elected is equal to or exceeds the number of vacancies to be filled, no further transfer of voting papers shall be made, and the remaining continuing candidate or candidates shall be treated as excluded.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If at any stage where candidates are treated as duly elected two or more candidates have the same value of votes credited to them, and there are not sufficient remaining vacancies for each of them to be elected, the candidates deemed to be elected shall be those who had in order the greatest value of votes at the earliest stage at which they had an unequal number of votes, or if the candidates have been credited with the same value of votes at all stages of the count, the matter shall be determined by lot (to be drawn by the Election Scrutineer).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Upon the circumstances in sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3) arising, the count is concluded.<BR><BR>
