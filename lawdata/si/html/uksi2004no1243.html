</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Tax Credits (Residence) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/654: "the principal Regulations").<BR><BR>
Section 3(3) of the Tax Credits Act 2002 requires a claim for a tax credit to be made jointly by a married couple or unmarried couple, both of who are aged at least 16 and are in the United Kingdom, or by a single person who is aged at least 16 and is in the United Kingdom. Section 3(7) gives the Treasury power to prescribe circumstances in which a person is treated as being, or not being, in the United Kingdom. The principal Regulations introduce an ordinary residence test.<BR><BR>
Regulation 1 of these Regulations provides for citation, commencement and effect, and regulation 2 provides for the principal Regulations to be amended.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 adds a new regulation 3(5) to the principal Regulations. The main effect of the amendment is that, where a person claims child tax credit (as opposed to being treated as making a claim) on or after 1st May 2004, he or she must have a legal right to reside in the United Kingdom. The legal right to reside may arise under either domestic or EC law.<BR><BR>
