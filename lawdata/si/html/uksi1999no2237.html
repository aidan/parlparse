Whereas, pursuant to section 18(1) of the Agriculture Act 1986[<a name="n1"><a href="#note1">1</A>], the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ("the Minister") has by order designated an area in the Upper Thames Tributaries as an environmentally sensitive area ("the designated area");<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And whereas it appears to the Minister that it is particularly desirable-<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the designated area together with an additional area in the valleys of the Upper Thames and its tributaries;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to conserve the flora and fauna and geological and physiographical features of those areas; and<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to protect buildings and other objects of historic interest in that area;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And whereas it appears to the Minister that the maintenance or adoption of particular agricultural methods in respect of the matters specified in the Schedules to the following Order is likely to facilitate such conservation, enhancement or protection;<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now therefore, the Minister, in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 18(1) and (4)[<a name="n2"><a href="#note2">2</A>] of the said Act, and of all other powers enabling him in that behalf, with the consent of the Treasury and after consultation with the Secretary of State, the Countryside Agency, the Nature Conservancy Council for England[<a name="n3"><a href="#note3">3</A>] in accordance with section 18(1) of the said Act, and with the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England in accordance with section 99 of the Environment Act 1995[<a name="n4"><a href="#note4">4</A>], makes the following Order:<BR><BR>

(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (Upper Thames Tributaries) Designation Order 1994 ("the principal Order") as amended, which designated an area in the Upper Thames Tributaries as an environmentally sensitive area, in implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2078/92 (OJ No. L215, 30.7.92, p. 85) on agricultural production methods compatible with the requirements of protection of the environment and the maintenance of the countryside, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 2772/95 (OJ No. L288, 1.12.95, p. 35) as in turn rectified by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1962/96 (OJ No. L259, 12.10.96).<BR><BR>
This Order replaces the Schedules to the principal Order (laying down detailed requirements of the scheme) by two new Schedules specifying the capital and management activities in respect of which payments may be made, and specifies the maximum payments in respect of such activities (<I>articles 8 and 9</I>).<BR><BR>
The area designated by the principal Order is increased (by an amendment to article 3 of the principal Order) and the designated area as thereby enlarged is shown (coloured yellow) in a new volume of maps dated 31st July 1999, which replaces the volume of maps referred to in article 3 of the principal Order dated 3rd March 1994 (<I>article 5</I>).<BR><BR>
In addition some modifications are made to the definitions set out in article 2(1) of the principal Order (<I>article 4</I>).<BR><BR>
The provisions of the principal Order that are amended or revoked do not include any that derive from the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (England) Designation Orders (Amendment) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/3104); those which derive from S.I. 1996/3104 are revoked (subject to a saving in certain cases) by the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (England) Designation Orders (Revocation of Specified Provisions) Regulations 1999, which come into force on 30th August 1999.<BR><BR>
No regulatory impact assessment has been made in respect of this Order.<BR><BR>
