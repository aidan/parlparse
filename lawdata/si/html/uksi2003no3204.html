(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The European Communities (Enforcement of Community Judgments) Order (S.I. 1972/1590) (the "1972 Order") provides for the registration and enforcement in the United Kingdom of certain decisions, judgments and orders of Community institutions which Member States are required to make enforceable in accordance with national law.<BR><BR>
This Order amends the 1972 Order to provide for the registration and enforcement as Community judgments of awards of costs made by the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market ("OHIM"). OHIM is an institution of the European Community established to administer the Community design pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 (OJ No L 3, 5.1.2002, p 1). Under Article 71 of that Regulation, a decision of OHIM fixing an award of costs is enforceable and enforcement is to be governed by the rules of civil procedure in the Member State where it is to be carried out.<BR><BR>
A regulatory impact assessment is available, copies of which have been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament. Copies of the assessment are also available from the Intellectual Property and Innovation Directorate of the Patent Office, Room 3B.38 Concept House, Cardiff Road, Newport NP10 8QQ.<BR><BR>
