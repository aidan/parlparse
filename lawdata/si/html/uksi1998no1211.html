<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order varies and clarifies the description of the limits of the Devon Sea Fisheries District (created and defined in 1892 by order of the Board of Trade under the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act 1888 (c. 54)). The district is extended to a point further upstream of the existing inshore limit in the River Plym for the better regulation of fishing for sea fish in those waters (article 2(1)). The description of the district's limits is enhanced by the specification of co-ordinates to assist in the location of particular points of reference (article 2(1)).<BR><BR>
The Order also varies the constitution of the local fisheries committee, originally constituted under the 1892 order, to take account of the changes made to the structure of local government in England under the Local Government Act 1992 (c. 19) and, in particular, the Devon (City of Plymouth and Borough of Torbay) (Structural Change) Order 1996 (S.I. 1996/1865). Since the number and size of the constituent councils has altered, the number of representatives from each council and their proportionate contributions to the expenses of the committee have been revised (article 2(3) and Schedule). Provision is also made for the minor amendment of article 2 of the 1892 order (article 2(2)).<BR><BR>
