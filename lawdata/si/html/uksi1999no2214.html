</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Section 354(2) of the Education Act 1996 provides that a modern foreign language specified in an Order made by the Secretary of State shall be one of the foundation subjects which comprise the National Curriculum. Such a language is to be studied by pupils in the third and fourth key stage, that is to say from the beginning of the school year when the majority of pupils in the class reach the age of twelve until the majority of those pupils cease to be of compulsory school age.<BR><BR>
These languages were specified in the Education (National Curriculum) (Modern Foreign Languages) Order 1991. This Order adds Irish to the languages specified in that Order but only as respects England. It will be a foundation subject only if the school concerned also offers pupils who are required to study a modern foreign language as part of the National Curriculum the alternative of studying at least one of the official languages of the European Community as a foundation subject.<BR><BR>
