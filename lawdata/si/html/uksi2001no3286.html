&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) In relation to a levy payment date the method of calculating the amount of the payment required to be made by either section 33(5) or 33(5A) of the Act ("the Amount") is as described in this regulation.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Amount is the number which results from applying the formula in paragraph (3) together with any modification to that number which is made pursuant to paragraph (5).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The formula is&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD>
C-A+a-ii+io-x+y+z</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
where&nbsp;-&nbsp;"C" is the aggregate payments paid or due to be paid by the nominated person in the relevant period pursuant to or otherwise arising from qualifying arrangements (to the extent not already taken into account in the calculation of the Amount for a previous levy payment date);<BR><BR>
"A" is the aggregate payments received by the nominated person during the relevant period in relation to sales of electricity or rights relating to electricity generated pursuant to qualifying arrangements;<BR><BR>
"a" is, subject to paragraph (4), the costs (other than interest) reasonably incurred by the nominated person in relation to the business in the relevant period;<BR><BR>
"ii" is interest received by the nominated person in the relevant period on any sums held by it in relation to the business;<BR><BR>
"io" is interest paid by the nominated person in the relevant period on borrowings made by it in order to enable it to conduct the business efficiently provided that the interest rate with reference to which such interest is calculated does not exceed the prescribed interest rate;<BR><BR>
"x" is zero unless the Authority has determined an amount in accordance with paragraph (6), in which case "x" is that amount;<BR><BR>
"y" is zero unless an amount is due to be paid on the levy payment date pursuant to regulation 28(4) and (5), in which case "y" is that amount; and<BR><BR>
"z" is zero unless the Authority has determined any amount in accordance with paragraph (7), in which case "z" is the aggregate of any such amounts.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The costs of the nominated person may only be included in item "a" above to the extent that those costs in the relevant period when added to the sum included as item "a" in the above calculation in each of the eleven months prior to the relevant period do not exceed the costs cap. Having so calculated, such costs incurred in the relevant period in excess of the costs cap may not be included in "a" in calculations of the Amount in relation to any future levy payment date.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Additions to or subtractions from the number resulting from the application of the formula in paragraph (3) may be made to reflect&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>

(b) over or underpayments where the procedures in regulation 42 have been followed.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where the Authority reasonably considers that the nominated person has not complied with the debt recovery procedure established in accordance with regulation 5A to a material extent in respect of a debt or debts, it may determine that an amount representing interest on any such outstanding debt or debts may be used as the figure for "x" in the formula in paragraph (3) for the purpose of calculating the Amount in relation to a particular levy payment date.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Where, in relation to any previous levy payment date in calculating the Amount the Authority has determined that "x" should include a figure in connection with a particular debt owing to the nominated person, and the said debt has since been recovered by the nominated person in full, for the purposes of calculating the Amount on the levy payment date following such recovery of the debt the Authority shall determine an amount for inclusion in "z" which is equivalent to the aggregate of any figures included in "x" in relation to that debt in the calculation of the Amount on any previous levy payment date.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Where the Amount is a positive number that number represents the amount which is required to be paid to the nominated person by section 33(5) of the Act in accordance with regulation 28.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Where the Amount is a negative number that number represents the amount which is required to be paid by the nominated person to the prescribed person by section 33(5A) of the Act in accordance with regulation 41.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Fossil Fuel Levy Regulations 1990 (S.I. 1990/266) ("the Principal Regulations"). They come into force on being made on 1st October 2001.<BR><BR>
The majority of the changes made are to adapt the Principal Regulations to the disappearance of public electricity suppliers which cease to exist from 1st October 2001 and to cater for the new definitions in the Electricity Act 1989 of `electricity supplier' and `electricity distributor', which come into force on the same date.<BR><BR>
Various other minor and consequential changes are made. Regulations 5 and 5A of the Principal Regulations are also re-enacted with minor amendment due to modifications to section 33 of the Electricity Act 1989 made by the Electricity from Non-Fossil Fuel Sources Saving Arrangements (Amendment) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/3268).<BR><BR>
