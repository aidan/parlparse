<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the Extradition (Safety of Maritime Navigation) Order 1997 ("the 1997 Order") which made provision in respect of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation ("the Convention") which is referred to in section 22(2)(j) of the Extradition Act 1989 ("the 1989 Act") as inserted by Schedule 3 to the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990. The 1997 Order also made provision in respect of the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf ("the Protocol") which is referred to in section 22(2)(k) of the 1989 Act, as so inserted.<BR><BR>
The change made by article 2(2) is to remove Romania, with which general extradition arrangements have been made, from Parts I and II to Schedule 2 to the 1997 Order. Article 2(3) adds to Parts I and II of that Schedule those States which have become parties to the Convention and the Protocol in relation to which Orders in Council under section 2 of the Extradition Act 1870 are in force. The change made by articles 3(2) and 4(2) removes Ukraine, with which general extradition arrangements have now been made, respectively from Parts IA and IB of Schedule 3 to the 1997 Order. Articles 3(3) and 4(3) amend Parts IA and IB to that Schedule by adding those States which have now become parties to the Convention and the Protocol respectively and with which no extradition treaties are in force.<BR><BR>
