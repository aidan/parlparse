</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations implement part of Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3rd June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments ("the Directive"), namely Articles 1 to 8, 15 and 17. The Regulations require information to be reported to the Inland Revenue about savings income paid to, or secured for, an individual resident in another member State in the course of a business or profession. The same is required in respect of some entities resident in other member States.<BR><BR>
Article 17(1) requires that regulations implementing the Directive be adopted and published before 1st January 2004.<BR><BR>
Article 17 of the Directive also provides for its commencement. Article 17(2) provides that for the Directive to apply from 1st January 2005 various arrangements between member States and other territories need to apply from that date. In accordance with Article 17(3), the Council will decide at least six months before 1st January 2005, whether this condition will be met. If it decides that it will not, it will adopt a new date on which the Directive will come into force provided that the condition will be met by that date. When the decision has been made the date of the commencement of these Regulations shall be notified in the London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes.<BR><BR>
When arrangements between the other territories and member States are in place these Regulations will be amended to implement those arrangements.<BR><BR>
Part 1 of these Regulations makes provision for &nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL><UL>
(i) who is required to make a report; "paying agents" and "receiving agents";<BR><BR>
(ii) in respect of whom a report needs to be made; "relevant payees" and "residual entities"; and<BR><BR>
(iii) what is meant by "savings income".<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
</UL><P>
Part 1 also sets out how an entity can elect to be treated as if it were a UCITS, authorised in accordance with Council Directive 85/611/EEC, for the purposes of the Directive.<BR><BR>
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision for &nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL><UL>
(i) obtaining and verifying information about the individual who receives the savings income or for whose benefit it is received or secured; and<BR><BR>
(ii) the information which needs to be reported to the Inland Revenue.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
</UL><P>
Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision for&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL><UL>
(i) notifying the Inland Revenue that a report needs to be made, and a penalty for failing to notify; and<BR><BR>
(ii) notices to be sent out by the Inland Revenue in respect of the report to be made.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
</UL><P>
Part 4 of these Regulations makes provision for audits and issues related to audits.<BR><BR>
Part 5 of these Regulations contains transitional provisions in respect of negotiable debt securities.<BR><BR>
