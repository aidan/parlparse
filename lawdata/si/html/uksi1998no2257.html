(b) from 27th April 1999-<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) remove two extraction solvents from the list of permitted extraction solvents and make consequential amendments (regulations 1(2), 2(c)(i) and (e)(i));<BR><BR>
(ii) provide a defence in respect of food or an extraction solvent placed on the market or labelled before 27th April 1999 which complies with the principal Regulations prior to their amendment by these Regulations (regulation 2(b)); and<BR><BR>
(iii) in relation to the permitted extraction solvent "hexane"-<BR><BR>
<UL>
(aa) reduce the maximum permitted residue in fats, oils and cocoa butter to 1 mg/kg; and<BR><BR>
(bb) as regards protein products, specify that only those products which have been defatted are those in the preparation of which such solvent may be added and provide that such products include defatted soya products as sold to the final consumer (regulation 2(d) and the Schedule).<BR><BR>
