&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting state the tax so charged shall not exceed:<BR><BR>

</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident and also includes any other item which, under the laws of the State of which the company paying the dividend is a resident, is treated as a dividend or distribution of the company.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 of this Convention, as the case may be, shall apply.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other State.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The provisions of this Article shall not apply if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The term "interest" for United Kingdom tax purposes includes any item which under the law of the United Kingdom is treated as interest and for Norwegian tax purposes includes any item which under the law of Norway is treated as interest, but shall not include any item which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10 of this Convention.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)  The provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 of this Convention, as the case may be, shall apply.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The provisions of this Article shall not apply if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.<BR><BR>

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 of this Convention, as the case may be, shall apply.<BR><BR>

such deduction in either case shall not, however, exceed that part of the Norwegian tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable, as the case may be, to the income or the same elements of capital which may be taxed in the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>
(b) Where in accordance with any provision of this Convention income derived or capital owned by a resident of Norway is exempt from tax in Norway, Norway may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this Article income, profits and capital gains owned by a resident of the United Kingdom which may be taxed in Norway in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in Norway.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumtances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The Convention with Norway set out in the Schedule to this Order replaces the Convention signed on 3rd October 1985 and set out in the Schedule to the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) Order (S.I. 1985/1998).<BR><BR>
The Convention provides for business profits not arising through a permanent establishment to be taxed only in the country of the taxpayer's residence. Profits attributable to a permanent establishment may be taxed in the country in which the permanent establishment is situated (Articles 5 and 7).<BR><BR>
Income from immovable property and gains derived from the alienation of such property may be taxed in the country in which the property is situated (Articles 6 and 13).<BR><BR>
Shipping and air transport profits are generally to be taxed only in the country of residence of the operator (Article 8).<BR><BR>
The Convention includes rules for determining taxable profits when a company in one country is related to a company in the other (Article 9).<BR><BR>
The rate of tax imposed in the country of source on dividends derived by a resident of the other country is not to exceed 5 per cent. of the gross amount of the dividends when the beneficial owner is a company controlling at least 10 per cent. of the voting power in the company paying the dividends. In all other cases the rate of tax shall not exceed 15 per cent. of the gross amount of the dividends (Article 10).<BR><BR>
In general, interest and royalties are to be taxed only in the country in which the beneficial owner is resident (Articles 11 and 12).<BR><BR>
Capital gains arising from the disposal of movable property are normally to be taxed only in the country of the taxpayer's residence. Gains arising from the disposal of assets of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the taxpayer has in the other country may be taxed in that other country (Article 13).<BR><BR>
The earnings of temporary business visitors and some other individuals are, subject to certain conditions, to be taxed only in the country of the taxpayer's residence (Articles 14 and 15). This general rule will not apply in circumstances where an employee and employer are resident in one country, the employment is exercised in the other country and the employer bears no responsibility for the services rendered by the employee who operates under the supervision and control of a person other than the employer. Instead the remuneration of that employee may also be taxed in the country in which the employment is exercised.<BR><BR>
Fees received by a resident of one country in his capacity as a director of a company resident in the other country may be taxed in the latter country (Article 16). Income derived from the activities of artistes and sportsmen may, with certain exemptions, be taxed in the country in which those activities are exercised (Article 17). Pensions (other than those paid in respect of Government service) and annuities are to be taxed only in the recipient's country of residence (Article 18). Government Service remuneration and pensions are normally taxable only by the paying Government (Article 19). Certain payments made to visiting students and business apprentices are to be exempt from tax in the country visited (Article 20).<BR><BR>
Other income not specified in the Convention will in most cases be taxed only by the country of which the beneficial owner is a resident (Article 21).<BR><BR>
The Capital Article (Article 22) reflects the existence of a capital tax in Norway and provides that capital represented by immovable property may be taxed in the country in which the property is situated. Capital represented by movable property is normally to be taxed only in the taxpayer's country of residence. Capital represented by assets of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the taxpayer has in the other country, may be taxed in the other country.<BR><BR>
Special rules are included in respect of income or profits from activities connected with offshore oil and gas exploration. Trading profits from such activities are deemed to arise through a permanent establishment or fixed base and, subject to a de minimis time rule, may be taxed in the country where the activities are carried on. Employees may, in general, be taxed in the country in which the employment is exercised. There are also special provisions covering capital gains on the disposal of offshore mineral exploration and exploitation rights and assets (Article 23).<BR><BR>
The Convention also includes special rules for the avoidance of double taxation of production profits from certain oil and gas fields in the North Sea, which extend across the dividing line between the United Kingdom and Norwegian sectors of the continental shelf (Articles 24 to 27).<BR><BR>
Where income continues to be taxable in both countries, credit will be given by the country of the taxpayer's residence in respect of tax imposed by the other country (Article 28).<BR><BR>
There are provisions safeguarding nationals and enterprises of one country against discriminatory taxation in the other country (Article 29). Provision is made for consultation and exchange of information between the taxation authorities of the two countries (Articles 30 and 31).<BR><BR>
The Exchange of Notes clarifies the intended interpretation of certain parts of the Convention.<BR><BR>
The Convention will enter into force on the date of the later of the notifications by each country of the completion of its legislative procedures. The Convention is to take effect in the United Kingdom from 1st April in respect of corporation tax and from 6th April for income tax and capital gains tax in the calendar year next following that in which it enters into force. The date of entry into force will in due course be published in the <I>London, Edinburgh</I> and <I>Belfast Gazettes</I>.<BR><BR>
