(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Police Authorities (Selection Panel) Regulations 1994.<BR><BR>
Section 106 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 (c. 16) repealed the restriction that a person could not be appointed as a member of a police authority if they had attained the age of 70 years. Regulation 3 removes the requirement for advertisements for persons willing to be appointed as members of a police authority to specify that the maximum age for appointment is 70 years.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 extends the circumstances in which a selection panel can act by a majority of its members.<BR><BR>
