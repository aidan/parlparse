<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order excludes land agreements, as defined in the Order, from the prohibition on anti-competitive agreements imposed by section 2 of the Competition Act 1998 (c. 41) ("the Chapter I prohibition"). The Order provides for a power to withdraw the exclusion from a particular agreement, and that an agreement to the like object or effect between the same parties to an agreement from which the exclusion is withdrawn is not excluded.<BR><BR>
This Order revokes the Competition Act 1998 (Land and Vertical Agreements Exclusion) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/310) ("the 2000 Order"). The 2000 Order excludes land agreements and vertical agreements from the Chapter I prohibition. The main difference between the two orders is that this Order does not exclude vertical agreements from the Chapter I prohibition except to the extent that a vertical agreement is a land agreement.<BR><BR>
