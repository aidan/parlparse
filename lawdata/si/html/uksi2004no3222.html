<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend paragraph 6 of Schedule 3 to the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995. Paragraph 6, as currently worded, prescribes the requirements which an applicant for, or holder of, a standard operator's licence must meet in order to be of appropriate financial standing but does not apply to national operations.<BR><BR>
The amendment applies the prescribed minimum amounts for capital and reserves to all standard licences, national as well as international.<BR><BR>
The amendment is made in implementation of Council Directive 98/76/EC of 1st October 1998 (O.J. L277 14th October 1998, page 17), which amended Council Directive 96/26/EC of 29th April 1996 on the admission to the occupation of road haulage operator and road passenger transport operator in national and international transport operations (O.J. L124 23rd May 1996, page 1).<BR><BR>
