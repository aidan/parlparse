</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order amends the Immigration (Designation of Travel Bans) Order 2000 ("the 2000 Order") by substituting Schedule 1 to this Order for the Schedule to the 2000 Order (which was previously substituted under the Immigration (Designation of Travel Bans) (Amendment) Order 2001). Any person named by or under a designated instrument, or of a description specified therein, as listed in the new Schedule will be excluded from the United Kingdom (subject to the exceptions specified in article 3 of the 2000 Order).<BR><BR>
The effect of substituting Schedule 1 for the Schedule to the 2000 Order is to bring together previous amendments to the list of resolutions and instruments that were made to the Schedule to the 2000 Order. In addition to this consolidation, this Order adds to, and deletes from, that list. The additions are, in Part 1 of the Schedule UN Resolution 1478(2003) of 6th May 2003 and, in Part 2 of the Schedule, Common Position 97/193/CFSP of 17th March 1997, Common Position 2003/115/CFSP of 18th February 2003, Common Position 2003/139/CFSP of 27th February 2003, Common Position 2003/280/CFSP of 16th April 2003, Common Position 2003/365/CFSP of 20th May 2003 and Common Position 2003/484/CFSP of 27th June 2003. The deletions are all from Part 2 of the Schedule and are Common Position 96/635/CFSP of 28th October 1996, Common Position 2000/346/CFSP of 26th April 2000, Common Position 2002/600/CFSP of 22nd July 2002 and Common Position 2002/831/CFSP of 18th October 2002.<BR><BR>
Schedule 2 to this Order revokes Orders which are replaced by the amendment made by Schedule 1 to this Order.<BR><BR>
