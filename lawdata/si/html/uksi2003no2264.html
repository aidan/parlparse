<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Feeding Stuffs (Enforcement) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/2325) in the United Kingdom.<BR><BR>
They implement in relation to all feeding stuffs the reporting requirement imposed by the penultimate paragraph of Article 1.7 of Directive 2001/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23rd July 2001 (amending Council Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition, and Directives 70/524/EEC, 96/25/EC and 1999/29/EC on animal nutrition). This paragraph forms the third paragraph of Article 16a of the amended Council Directive 95/53/EC and requires those charged with the duty of monitoring farms in relation to residues under Council Directive 96/23/EC (OJ No. L125, 23.5.96, p. 10), and others in charge of laboratories carrying out analyses, to report any breaches of legal requirements relating to feeding stuffs if they obtain evidence of such breaches in the course of performing their duties.<BR><BR>
