These Regulations, which come into force on 1st January 2000, make one change to the Statistics of Trade (Customs and Excise) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992/2790) ("the 1992 Regulations").<BR><BR>
Since 1st January 1993 the collection of statistics relating to the trading of goods between member States has been governed by Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3330/91 (OJ No. L316, 16.11.91, p.1). Article 28 of that Council Regulation makes provision for the application of statistical thresholds, known as assimilation thresholds. Traders whose annual value of trade with other member States exceeds the assimilation thresholds set for trade in goods dispatched, or for goods received, are required to provide additional statistical information in the form of supplementary declarations. Thresholds are to be set annually by the member States in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 2256/92 (OJ No. L219, 4.8.92, p.40).<BR><BR>
The 1992 Regulations gave effect in the United Kingdom to Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3330/91 insofar as this was necessary. These Regulations amend regulation 3(1) of the 1992 Regulations by raising the assimilation thresholds to £233,000.<BR><BR>
The thresholds were set at £230,000 by the Statistics of Trade (Customs and Excise) (Amendment) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998 No. 2973), which are, accordingly, revoked by regulation 3 of these Regulations.<BR><BR>
