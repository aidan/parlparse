</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations enable the Secretary of State to make or arrange for the making of grant for the improvement of energy efficiency in dwellings occupied by persons on low incomes with children, elderly persons on low incomes or persons in receipt of benefit relating to ill health. These Regulations extend to England only. They revoke and re-enact, with changes, in so far as they apply to England, the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme Regulations 1997 (S.I.1997/790), which accordingly still apply to Scotland, as amended (S.I.1999/1018 (S.72)), and to Wales. The functions of the Secretary of State under section 15 of the Social Security Act 1990 are, so far as exercisable in relation to Wales, made exercisable concurrently with the National Assembly for Wales by the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672).<BR><BR>
Among the changes made by these Regulations are the following&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;-&nbsp; a restriction of the categories of person who may apply for grant (regulation 4);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;-&nbsp; a wider set of purposes for which grant may be made (regulation 5);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;-&nbsp; an increase in the maximum grant that may be payable (regulation 6).</UL><P>
Regulation 3 enables the Secretary of State to impose conditions on the making of grant, to appoint a scheme manager to carry out his functions in connection with the making of grant, and to make payments of grant to persons other than the grant applicant.<BR><BR>
Regulation 4 sets out the categories of persons who may apply for grant according to the benefits, allowances and pensions they receive.<BR><BR>
Regulation 5 describes the purposes for which grant may be approved, including energy saving devices.<BR><BR>
Regulation 6 sets the maximum amount of grant payable which, depending on the circumstances of the applicant and the works to be carried out, may be £700, £1,000 or £2,000.<BR><BR>
Regulation 7 provides for the making of applicants, setting out the person to whom the application should be made and the general rules as to form and contents of applications.<BR><BR>
Regulation 8 contains revocation and transitional provisions.<BR><BR>
