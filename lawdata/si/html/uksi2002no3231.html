These Regulations amend the Animal By-Products (Identification) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/614, as already amended) in so far as they extend to England. Those Regulations ("the 1995 Regulations") extend to the whole of Great Britain and currently make provision for the sterilisation or staining of animal by-products and for the control of the movement of such by-products.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="2">2.</B>
The effect of the amendments made to the 1995 Regulations by paragraphs (2)(c), (4), (6)(a), (b), (c), (e) and (f), (7)(a) and (b)(ii), (8), (9) and (10) of regulation 2 of these Regulations is that animal by-products may no longer be sterilised. Staining is now required in all cases, except where specified in regulation 5(2), 6(2) or 7(2) of the 1995 Regulations. The effect of the amendments made to regulations 6(2) and 7(2) of the 1995 Regulations by paragraphs (6)(d) and (g) and (7)(b)(i) and (c) respectively of regulation 2 of these Regulations is that staining is not required where an animal by-product is immediately moved in the manner specified in regulation 6(4) or, as the case may be, 7(3) of the 1995 Regulations to premises approved under article 7 of the Animal By-Products Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/646, as amended) for rendering there or to other premises for incineration there in accordance with article 10 of that Order.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="3">3.</B>
Regulation 2(2)(a) of these Regulations amends the interpretation provision of the 1995 Regulations by substituting for the definition denoting the Animal By-Products Order 1992 a new definition denoting the Animal By-Products Order 1999, regulation 2(2)(b) of these Regulations inserts a definition of "approved premises" into that interpretation provision and regulation 2(5) of these Regulations substitutes references to the definition denoting the Animal By-Products Order 1999 for the references to the definition denoting the Animal By-Products Order 1992 in regulation 5(2)(c) and (d) of the 1995 Regulations.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="4">4.</B>
A minor amendment is also made by regulation 2(3) of these Regulations to the definition of "animal by-product" in relation 3(1) of the 1995 Regulations.<BR><BR>

Functions formerly exercisable by "the Ministers" (being, in relation to England and Wales and acting jointly, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State respectively concerned with health in England and food and health in Wales and, in relation to Scotland, the Secretary of State) are now exercisable in relation to England by the Secretary of State pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 5 to the Food Standards Act 1999 (1999 c. 28), and paragraph 21 of that Schedule amends section 48 of the 1990 Act. Functions of "the Ministers" so far as exercisable in relation to Wales were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales by the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672), as read with section 40(3) of the 1999 Act, and those functions so far as exercisable in relation to Scotland were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (1998 c. 46), as read with section 40(2) of the 1999 Act. Regulation 13(4) of the Food Standards Act 1999 (Transitional and Consequential Provisions and Savings) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/656) expressly authorises the Secretary of State to amend existing Regulations made or having effect as if made by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (whether with others or not) under the 1990 Act.<a href="#n2">back</a><p>
