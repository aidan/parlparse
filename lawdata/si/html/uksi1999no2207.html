<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order, which comes into force on the 1st September 1999, fixes the amounts of the tolls to be paid to use the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing.<BR><BR>
The classes of vehicles in respect of which tolls may be levied under the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Act ("the Act") are those established by the Dartford Tunnel Tolls (Revision) Order 1983[<a name="n3"><a href="#note3">3</A>]. As in previous years, a toll is levied in respect of all classes except that comprising bicycles which are not mechanically powered.<BR><BR>
For each class of vehicle in respect of which a toll is levied, the amount of the toll has been calculated, in accordance with section 17(5) of the Act, by increasing the amount applicable in the case of that class on 1st January 1986 by the same percentage as the percentage increase in the retail prices index between December 1985 and June 1999 which is the base month in relation to the revision date in question. The percentage increase is 72.41% and after applying the rounding provisions in section 17(6) of the Act results in an increase in tolls as follows:<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) for heavy goods vehicles, motor coaches or omnibuses having more than two axles, of 10 pence (from £2.70 to £2.80).<BR><BR>
(b) for each special type vehicle which is only permitted to be on the road under the authority of an Order made by the Secretary of State under section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, of 10 pence (from £2.70 to £2.80).<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
The tolls for all other classes of vehicle in respect of which tolls are leviable remain at the level prescribed by the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Tolls Order 1998. That Order is now revoked.<BR><BR>
