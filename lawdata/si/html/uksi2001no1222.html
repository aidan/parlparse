</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Road Traffic (Owner Liability) Regulations 2000 to transfer administrative functions of justices' clerks under those Regulations to justices' chief executives in accordance with section 90 of, and Schedule 13 to, the Access to Justice Act 1999 (c.22).<BR><BR>
Subsection (5) of that section provides that for the purposes of that section the administrative functions of justices' clerks are all of their functions apart from those which are legal functions within the meaning given by section 48(2) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 (c.25), as substituted by section 89(1) of the 1999 Act.<BR><BR>
The Regulations revoke the Road Traffic (Owner Liability) (Amendment) Regulations 2001 which contained an incorrect reference to the 2000 Regulations (which were not published).<BR><BR>
