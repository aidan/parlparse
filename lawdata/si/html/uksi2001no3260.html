Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3820/85 of 20th December 1985 on harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport ("the Council Regulation") provides that Member States may, after authorisation by the Commission, grant exceptions from the application of the provisions of that Regulation to transport operations carried out in exceptional circumstances.<BR><BR>
