</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order brings into force sections 145 to 151 of the Transport Act 2000 together with certain other provisions for purposes connected with the coming into force of those sections.<BR><BR>
Sections 145 to 150 confer on pensioners and specified disabled persons resident in the area of a "travel concession authority" entitlement to a half-fare concession on journeys on local bus services within that area. Entitlement is conditional upon production of a travel permit which must be issued free of charge by the local authority. The enactments make provision as to reimbursement of local bus service operators by the local authority. These provisions are brought into force so far as is necessary to enable travel concession authorities to publish proposals for reimbursement of operators, on 1st January 2001, for other preliminary purposes on 1st February 2001 and for all other purposes on 1st June 2001. This provision of the Order has effect for England outside Greater London only.<BR><BR>
Section 151 makes similar provision in relation to persons resident in Greater London. It amends the Greater London Authority Act 1999 to provide that London local authorities must make arrangements for the grant of the half-fare concession on journeys on the London bus network if the reserve free travel scheme is not to be brought into effect. These provisions are brought into force on 1st April 2001.<BR><BR>
The Order also contains transitional provisions (in Articles 3 and 4).<BR><BR>
