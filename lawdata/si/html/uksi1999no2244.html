</UL><P>
<UL>
"infrastructure controller" has the meaning assigned to it by regulation 2(1) of the Railways (Safety Case) Regulations 1994[<a name="n2"><a href="#note2">2</A>];</UL><P>

<UL>
"railway" has the meaning assigned to it by the Schedule to these Regulations;</UL><P>
<UL>
"relevant approach" means-</UL><P>
<UL>
(a) an approach to a stop signal referred to in sub-paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of "train protection system" in this regulation except where a train travelling at the maximum speed it could attain on that approach would be stopped within the distance between the signal and the point where it could collide with another train by reason of the train protection system installed at the stop signal;<BR><BR>
(b) an approach to part of the railway where there is a speed restriction if-<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) the permitted speed on that approach is 60 miles per hour or more; and<BR><BR>

</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Nothing in these Regulations shall require equipment referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of a train protection system to function in relation to a temporary speed restriction, and accordingly any reference in these Regulations to the permitted speed in relation to such equipment is, in a case where a temporary speed restriction is in place, a reference to the permitted speed which normally applies on that part of the line concerned.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations contain provisions with respect to the use of a train protection system, Mark I rolling stock and rolling stock with hinged doors. The Regulations apply to a railway as defined in regulation 2(1) and the Schedule.<BR><BR>
The Regulations prohibit the operation of a train on a railway unless a train protection system (as defined in regulation 2(1)) is in service for that train and railway (regulation 3(1)).<BR><BR>
The Regulation provides that until 1st January 2004 it is sufficient compliance with the prohibition referred to above if a programme approved by the Health and Safety Executive for the bringing into service of a train protection system is being implemented (regulation 3(2)).<BR><BR>
Specified railways are excluded from the prohibition referred to above if there is in service other equipment specified in the regulation (regulation 3(3)).<BR><BR>
The Regulations contain specified defences in respect of equipment which has failed or been taken out of service because of a fault (regulation 3(4) and (5)).<BR><BR>
The Regulations prohibit the operation of Mark I rolling stock (as defined in regulation 2(1)), except that until 1st January 2005 the prohibition does not apply to any such stock which has been modified in a specified manner (regulation 4(1) and (3)).<BR><BR>
Specified railways are excluded from the prohibition of Mark I rolling stock (regulation 4(2)).<BR><BR>
The Regulations prohibit the operation of rolling stock with hinged doors for use by passengers, except rolling stock exclusively operated other than for the carriage of fare paying passengers (regulation 5).<BR><BR>
The Regulations empower the Health and Safety Executive to grant exemptions from the Regulations (regulation 6).<BR><BR>
The Regulations amend the Reporting of Injuries, Disease and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995. The effect of the amendment is to remove an exception from the requirement to notify and report specified incidents of signals passed without authority.<BR><BR>
A copy of the regulatory impact assessment prepared in respect of these Regulations can be obtained from the Railways Directorate, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Zone 3/29 Great Minster House, 76 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DR.
