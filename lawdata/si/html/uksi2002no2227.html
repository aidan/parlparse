<B>Note 2:</B> Schedule 10 to the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 provides that a tenant of residential property under a long residential tenancy has a right, at the end of the original term of the tenancy, to continue as a tenant on the same terms as before unless the landlord ends the tenancy in accordance with the provisions of that Act. But see also Note 3.</UL><P>
<UL>
<B>Note 3:</B> In certain circumstances, Schedule 10 does not apply and the landlord can end your tenancy by giving notice in accordance with the ordinary requirements of the law. These circumstances include cases where:</UL><P>
<UL>
(a) you pay more than a low rent (see paragraph 2(4) and (5) of Schedule 10) <B>unless</B> the property is a house and the tenancy has been extended under section 14 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, in which case Schedule 10 applies regardless of whether a low rent is being paid;<BR><BR>
(b) the property has a high rateable value (see paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1988, unless the long tenancy was granted after 31st March 1990, in which case paragraph 1(2A) of Schedule 10 applies);<BR><BR>
(c) the tenancy does not meet certain requirements for the existence of an assured tenancy set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1988&nbsp;-&nbsp;for instance because the landlord is the Crown, a local authority or another exempt landlord;<BR><BR>

These Regulations amend two forms which are prescribed for the purposes of Schedule 10 to the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (security of tenure on ending of long residential tenancies).<BR><BR>
The forms affected are set out in the Schedule to the Long Residential Tenancies (Principal Forms) Regulations 1997. Changes are made to the notes at the end of Forms 1 and 2 following the amendment of section 16 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 by section 143 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 (which was brought into force on 26th July by S.I. 2002/1912). There are other drafting changes.<BR><BR>
