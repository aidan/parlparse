</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 and the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 in respect of late claims for retirement pension where the claimant or his spouse has paid insufficient contributions for the tax years 1996-97 to 2001-02.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2 provides for a late claim for a Category A or Category B retirement pension to be treated as made at pensionable age when those deficient contributions are paid. Regulation 3 provides for a decision disallowing a late claim for a Category A or B retirement pension to be revised as from pensionable age when the deficient contributions are paid.<BR><BR>
A regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no impact on the costs of business.<BR><BR>
