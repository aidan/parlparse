<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order is made under section 1 of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. It reforms the law relating to licensing hours which has the effect of imposing burdens on people carrying out certain activities with a view to reducing those burdens in respect of New Year's Eve. It does so by amending provisions in the Regulatory Reform (Special Occasions Licensing) Order 2001 to allow the sale of intoxicating liquor in licensed premises (other than off-licences), in registered clubs and in licensed canteens in the period between what would otherwise be the end of the permitted hours on New Year's Eve and the beginning of permitted hours on the following day.<BR><BR>
Provision is also made for reforming the law relating to the licensing of public entertainments, in particular the licensing of public music and dancing, with a view to reducing the burdens it imposes on people carrying out certain activities where they take place at New Year's Eve. The effect of the Order is to allow premises in respect of which there are Special Occasions licensing hours, and in respect of which there is an entertainment licence in force, to be kept open on New Year's Eve and during the Special Occasions licensing hours for any purposes authorised by the entertainment licence beyond the time authorised by the licence itself.<BR><BR>
