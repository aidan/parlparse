(g) the terms and conditions set out in Part II of Schedule 1 (terms and conditions to be included in irradiation licences) are varied (<I>regulation 11</I>);<BR><BR>

(k) paragraph 3(b) of Part VI of Schedule 1 is amended to vary the maximum sums which fall to be paid in any one year in respect of the inspections referred to in regulation 9(3) (<I>regulation 14(b)</I>); and<BR><BR>
(l) a revised Schedule 2 (relating to the import of food) is substituted for the existing Schedule so numbered (which also deals with the import of food) (<I>regulation 15</I>).<BR><BR>

(d) a revised sub-paragraph (b) of regulation 15(4) (providing an exception to the requirement that the names of the ingredients of a compound ingredient used in the preparation of a food have to be given in the list of ingredients of the food) is substituted for the existing sub-paragraph (b) of regulation 15(4) (<I>regulation 20</I>);<BR><BR>
(e) regulation 26 (small packages and certain indelibly marked bottles) is amended to require certain food which, although exempted from the requirement to be marked or labelled with a list of ingredients, nevertheless contains an ingredient which has been irradiated, to be marked and labelled accordingly (<I>regulation 21</I>);<BR><BR>
(f) regulation 35 (which imposes a general requirement as to the manner of marking or labelling of certain food) is so amended that the alternative to that requirement contained at the end of that regulation is modified in the case of a specified category of that food which has been irradiated (<I>regulation 22</I>);<BR><BR>
(g) regulation 36 (which imposes a requirement as to the manner of marking or labelling of certain other food) is so amended that&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) the application of paragraphs (2) to (4) of that regulation (which permit the use of alternative labelling in the case of certain food which has been or contains an ingredient which has been irradiated) is restricted to food which is prepared for patients requiring sterile diets under medical supervision, and<BR><BR>
(ii) in the case of the sale of food to which regulation 23 or 27 of S.I. 1996/1499 applies which has been irradiated (other than food which is prepared for patients requiring sterile diets under medical supervision), the commercial documents relating to the food must in all cases indicate that it has been irradiated (<I>regulation 23</I>); and<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
(h) the defence in relation to exports (regulation 47) is updated to include a reference to Directive 1999/2/EC (<I>regulation 24</I>).<BR><BR>

1990 c. 16. Functions formerly exercisable by "the Ministers" are now exercisable in relation to England by the Secretary of State pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 5 to the Food Standards Act 1999 (1999 c. 28), and paragraphs 12 and 21 of that Schedule amend sections 17(1) and 48 of the 1990 Act. Functions of "the Ministers" so far as exercisable in relation to Wales were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales by S.I. 1999/672 and those functions so far as exercisable in relation to Scotland were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (1999 c. 46). Regulation 13(4) of S.I. 2000/656 expressly authorises the Secretary of State to amend existing Regulations made by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (whether with others or not) under the Food Safety Act 1990.<a href="#n1">back</a><p>
