These Regulations amend Schedules 1, 4, 6 and 9 to the 1995 Regulations.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="2">2.</B>
The amendment to Schedule 1 requires a person whose licence has been suspended or revoked to surrender the licence to the Food Standards Agency.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The amendment to Schedule 4 shortens the time that birds can be suspended before being stunned or killed. This measure does not come into force until 6th January 2005.<BR><BR>
