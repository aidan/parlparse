</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order is a special development order made under section 59 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 applying to land within the London Borough of Camden.<BR><BR>
It makes provision for publicity for planning applications for development within the designated area in order to permit some applications to be advertised on an internet website. EIA applications accompanied by an environmental statement are required to be publicised by both a site notice and local advertisement. Applications which do not accord with the development plan or would affect a public right of way are required to be publicised by site notice and by a notice published on a website (if one is maintained by the local planning authority for this purpose). All other applications, including those for major development, are required to be publicised either by a site notice or by serving notice on any adjoining owner or occupier. Applications for major development are additionally required to be publicised by a notice published on a website (if one is maintained by the local authority for this purpose). In all other respects the provisions of the 1995 Order will continue to apply to land within the designated area.<BR><BR>
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as it has no impact on the costs of businesses, charities or voluntary bodies.<BR><BR>
