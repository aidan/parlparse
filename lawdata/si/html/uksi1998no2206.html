</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The Order amends the Plant Health (Forestry) (Great Britain) Order 1993. It provides that an inspector may require the occupier or other person in charge of premises where an examination is taking place to provide adequate lighting and, where appropriate, suitable inspection areas (article 2).<BR><BR>
In doing so, the Order implements Commission Directive 98/22/EC (OJ No. L126, 28.4.98, p.26) laying down the minimum conditions for carrying out plant health checks in the Community, at inspection posts other than those at the place of destination, of plants, plant products or other objects coming from third countries.<BR><BR>
A Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared and placed in the library of both Houses of Parliament. Copies can be obtained from the Forestry Commission, 231 Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh EH12 7AT.<BR><BR>
