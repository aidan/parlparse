(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations amend the Motor Vehicles (Type Approval of Reduced Pollution Adaptations) Regulations 1998 by amending the prescribed type approval requirements for reduced pollution devices. The amended requirements reflect the particulate emission levels contained in Directive 1999/96/EC.<BR><BR>
They also make a minor amendment to the requirements relating to the marking of reduced pollution devices and insert a diagram headed "Chassis Dynamometer Schedule" into the Schedule to the 1998 Regulations. The diagram is the "graphical display" referred to at the end of the Table in paragraph 3 of the Schedule, which was omitted in error.<BR><BR>
