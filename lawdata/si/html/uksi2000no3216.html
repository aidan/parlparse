These Regulations implement amendments to Chapter VII (Carriage of Dangerous Goods) of the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, as amended (SOLAS) adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organization on 27 May 1999 at its 71st session by Resolution MSC 87(71). The purpose of these amendments is to give effect to the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes on Board Ships ("the INF Code"), which was adopted at the same session of the Maritime Safety Committee by Resolution 88(71). The text of the Code appears as an Annex to that Resolution.<BR><BR>
The Regulations apply from 1 January 2001 to all ships, regardless of size, engaged in the carriage of packaged irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes. Ships are required to hold a valid International Certificate of Fitness, which is issued in relation to United Kingdom ships by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency on behalf of the Secretary of State, certifying that they have been constructed to certain standards including such matters as strength and stability, fire protection, cargo securement and temperature control, and integrity of power supplies.<BR><BR>
