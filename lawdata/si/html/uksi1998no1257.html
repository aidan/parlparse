This Order increases the limits of liability of owners hovercraft consequent upon the implementation of the 1996 Protocol to the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976 following its ratification by, and entry into force for, the UK. The Order does this by amending the Hovercraft (Civil Liability) Order 1986 (SI 1986/1305). Corresponding changes to the limits which apply to ships are made by the Merchant Shipping (Convention on the Liability for Maritime Claims) (Amendment) Order 1998 (S.I. 1998/1258).<BR><BR>
