(c) a document purporting to be such a certificate shall, in any proceedings, be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to be such a certificate.<BR><BR>

</UL><P>
the person who paid the sum shall, to the extent of that sum, be in the same position with respect to any distribution made in proceedings under this section as the person to whom it was paid would have been.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where the person who incurred the liability has voluntarily made any reasonable sacrifice or taken any other reasonable measures to prevent or reduce damage to which the liability extends or might have extended he shall be in the same position with respect to any distribution made in proceedings under this section as if he had a claim in respect of the liability equal to the cost of the sacrifice or other measures.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The court may, if it thinks fit, postpone the distribution of such part of the amount to be distributed as it deems appropriate having regard to any claims that may later be established before a court of any country outside the Islands.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) No lien or other right in respect of any ship or other property shall affect the proportions in which any amount is distributed in accordance with subsection (2)(b) above.<BR><BR>

165.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) Where it is alleged that the owner of a ship has incurred a liability under section 153 as a result of any discharge or escape of oil occurring, or a result of any relevant threat of contamination arising, while there was in force a contract of insurance or other security to which such a certificate as is mentioned in section 163 related, proceedings to enforce a claim in respect of the liability may be brought against the person who provided the insurance or other security (in the following provisions of this section referred to as "the insurer").<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In any proceedings brought against the insurer by virtue of this section it shall be a defence (in addition to any defence affecting the owner's liability), to prove that the discharge or escape, or (as the case may be) the threat of contamination, was due to the wilful misconduct of the owner himself.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The insurer may limit his liability in respect of claims made against him by virtue of this section in like manner and to the same extent as the owner may limit his liability but the insurer may do so whether or not the discharge or escape, or (as the case may be), the threat of contamination, resulted from anything done or omitted to be done by the owner as mentioned in section 157(3).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where the owner and the insurer each apply to the court for the limitation of his liability any sum paid into court in pursuance of either application shall be treated as paid also in pursuance of the other.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) The Fund shall be liable for pollution damage in the territory of the Islands if the person suffering the damage has been unable to obtain full compensation under section 153&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) because the discharge or escape, or the relevant threat of contamination, by reason of which the damage was caused&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) resulted from an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible phenomenon, or<BR><BR>
(ii) was due wholly to anything done or omitted to be done by another person (not being a servant or agent of the owner) with intent to do damage, or<BR><BR>
(iii) was due wholly to the negligence or wrongful act of a government or other authority in exercising its function of maintaining lights or other navigational aids for the maintenance of which it was responsible,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
(and because liability is accordingly wholly displaced by section 155), or<BR><BR>
(b) because the owner or guarantor liable for the damage cannot meet his obligations in full, or<BR><BR>
(c) because the damage exceeds the liability under section 153 as limited by section 157.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subsection (1) above shall apply with the substitution for the words "the Islands" of the words "a Fund Convention country" where the incident has caused pollution damage in the territory of the Islands and of another Fund Convention country, and proceedings under the Liability Convention for compensation for the pollution damage have been brought in a country which is not a Fund Convention country or in the Islands.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the incident has caused pollution damage in the territory of the Islands and of another country in respect of which the Liability Convention is in force, references in this section to the provisions of Chapter III of this Part shall include references to the corresponding provisions of the law of any country giving effect to the Liability Convention.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) . . . <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of this section an owner or guarantor is to be treated as incapable of meeting his obligations if the obligations have not been met after all reasonable steps to pursue the legal remedies available have been taken.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Expenses reasonably incurred, and sacrifices reasonably made, by the owner voluntarily to prevent or minimise pollution damage shall be treated as pollution damage for the purposes of this section, and accordingly he shall be in the same position with respect to claims against the Fund under this section as if he had a claim in respect of liability under section 153.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The Fund shall incur no obligation under this section if&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) it proves that the pollution damage&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war or insurrection, or<BR><BR>
(ii) was caused by oil which has escaped or been discharged from a warship or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, at the time of the occurrence, only on Government non-commercial service, or<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
(b) the claimant cannot prove that the damage resulted from an occurrence involving a ship identified by him, or involving two or more ships one of which is identified by him.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) If the Fund proves that the pollution damage resulted wholly or partly&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) from anything done or omitted to be done with intent to cause damage by the person who suffered the damage, or<BR><BR>
(b) from the negligence of that person,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
the Fund may (subject to subsection (10) below) be exonerated wholly or partly from its obligations to pay compensation to that person.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Where the liability under section 153 in respect of the pollution damage is limited to any extent by subsection (8) of that section, the Fund shall (subject to subsection (10) below) be exonerated to the same extent.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Subsections (8) and (9) above shall not apply where the pollution damage consists of the costs of preventive measures or any damage caused by such measures.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A certificate given by the Director of the Fund stating that subparagraph (c) of paragraph 4 of Article 4 of the Fund Convention is applicable to any claim under section 175 shall be conclusive evidence for the purposes of this Chapter that it is so applicable.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purpose of giving effect to paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 4 of the Fund Convention a court giving judgment against the Fund in proceedings under section 175 shall notify the Fund, and&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) no steps shall be taken to enforce the judgment unless and until the court gives leave to enforce it,<BR><BR>
(b) that leave shall not be given unless and until the Fund notifies the court either that the amount of the claim is not to be reduced under those paragraphs, or that it is to be reduced to a specified amount, and<BR><BR>
(c) in the latter case the judgment shall be enforceable only for the reduced amount.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any steps taken to obtain payment of an amount or a reduced amount in pursuance of such a judgment as is mentioned in subsection (3) above shall be steps to obtain payment in dollars; and&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) for the purpose of converting such an amount from special drawing rights into dollars one special drawing right shall be treated as equal to such a sum in dollars as the International Monetary Fund have fixed as being the equivalent of one special drawing right for&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) the relevant day, namely the day on which the Assembly of the Fund decide the date for the first payment of compensation in respect of the incident, or<BR><BR>
(ii) if no sum has been so fixed for the relevant day, the last day before that day for which a sum has been so fixed; and<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
(b) a certificate given by or on behalf of the Financial Secretary stating&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(i) that a particular sum in dollars has been so fixed for the relevant day, or<BR><BR>

</UL><P>
shall be conclusive evidence of those matters for the purposes of this Chapter.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The Secretary of State may by order make such amendments of this section and Part I of Schedule 5 as appear to him to be appropriate for the purpose of giving effect to the entry into force of any amendment of the provisions set out in that Schedule.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Any document purporting to be such a certificate as is mentioned in subsection (2) or (4)(b) above shall, in any legal proceedings, be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to be such a certificate.<BR><BR>

</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
The International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 (CLC), which was extended to the Cayman Islands by Schedule 1 to the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) (Cayman Islands) Order 1975, provides uniform rules and procedures for determining questions of liability and for awarding compensation when damage is caused by pollution resulting from the escape or discharge of oil from ships. The International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971 (the 1971 Fund Convention) which was extended to the Cayman Islands by Schedule 2 to the 1975 Order set up an international fund to provide a supplementary system for compensation and indemnification for such damage. The 1992 Protocol to the CLC and the 1992 Protocol to the Fund Convention respectively create a new 1992 Civil Liability Convention and a 1992 Fund Convention, which together provide for higher levels of compensation and more extensive liability. The 1992 Protocols are given effect in the United Kingdom by Part VI, Chapters III and IV of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. This Order extends those provisions of the 1995 Act to the Cayman Islands, with the necessary exceptions, modifications and adaptations.<BR><BR>
