These Regulations are made under section 18 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 ("the 1989 Act") as amended by section 99 of the Local Government Act 2000.

These Regulations apply to district, county and London borough councils and provide that they must have regard to the recommendations of independent remuneration panels in relation to allowance schemes made under the 1991 Regulations.<BR><BR>
Regulation 3 provides that authorities must have regard to the recommendations of an independent remuneration panel established under regulation 4.
