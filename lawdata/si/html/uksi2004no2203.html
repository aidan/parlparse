<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
Part 1 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 establishes a new system of regional development planning in England. These Regulations make provision for the operation of the regional planning system.<BR><BR>
The Regulations set out the criteria for the recognition of a Regional Planning Body ("RPB") and regulate its preparation of an annual monitoring report and regional participation statement. They prescribe the form and content of a draft revision of a Regional Spatial Strategy ("RSS") and regulate the procedure to be followed in connection with the preparation of the draft revision. There are also provisions about electronic communications (regulation 3) and the availability of documents (Part 5).<BR><BR>
The main steps in the procedure for the preparation of a draft revision are&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
consultation with certain bodies prior to the submission of the draft revision to the Secretary of State (regulation 11);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
submission to the Secretary of State (regulation 12);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
publication of the draft revision and of associated documents, in respect of which representations may be made (regulation 13);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where the Secretary of State decides that an examination in public should be held to consider the draft revision and representations on it, publication of details about the examination (regulation 14);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
publication of the report of the person appointed to hold the examination (regulation 15);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
publication of any changes the Secretary of State proposes to make to the draft revision, in respect of which representations may be made (regulation 16);<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
publication of the revised RSS (regulation 17).<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
There are also provisions about the procedure to be followed if an RSS is withdrawn by an RPB or the Secretary of State (regulation 18) and if the Secretary of State prepares a draft revision (regulation 23).<BR><BR>
