<B>
Interpretation of Part 3</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="10">10.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) In this Part, "potential audience" means, in relation to a local radio multiplex service, the persons who have attained the age of 15 years and reside within the protected area for that service.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the purposes of this Part, a person who holds a licence to provide local digital sound programme services provides such a service if, and only if&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the service is one provided by him and is included in a local radio multiplex service for which he holds a local radio multiplex licence; or<BR><BR>
(b) under a contract between that person and a person who holds a licence to provide a local radio multiplex service, the person holding the licence to provide the radio multiplex service is required to include that local digital sound programme service in that multiplex service.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In this Part, "the protected area" means, in relation to a local radio multiplex service&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) subject to sub-paragraph (b), the area or locality specified in a notice published under section 50(1) of the 1996 Act [<a name="n6"><a href="#note6">6</A>] as that in which that multiplex service is to be available, or<BR><BR>
(b) if different from that area or locality, the area or locality specified in the relevant licence as that in which that multiplex service is to be available,<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
and in this paragraph, "the relevant licence" means the local radio multiplex licence under which the multiplex service concerned is authorised to be provided.<BR><BR>
<B>
Local digital sound programme services</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>
<a name="11">11.</B>
&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1) A person ("the relevant person") who provides local digital sound programme services under the authority of a local digital sound programme licence may not provide a further such service ("the further service") in any case where, if he did so, there would be a contravention of paragraph (2) at the time immediately after he began providing the further service.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This paragraph is contravened if&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) the relevant person is already providing the threshold number, or more than that number, of local digital sound programme services; and<BR><BR>
(b) the number of points attributable (according to Table 1 below) to local digital sound programme services provided by the relevant person in the market area of the relevant multiplex service represents more than 55 per cent. of the total number of points attributable (according to Table 2) to all local digital sound programme services provided in that market area, whether by the relevant person or by any other person.<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2), the threshold number of local digital sound programme services is four such services, comprising significant services or intermittent services (or any combination of significant services and intermittent services) that are included&nbsp;-&nbsp;<BR><BR>
<UL>
(a) in the relevant multiplex service; or<BR><BR>
(b) in any other local radio multiplex service which overlaps with the relevant multiplex service, or in any two or more local radio multiplex services which so overlap, taking the number of significant or intermittent services in those multiplex services together; or<BR><BR>
(c) in the relevant multiplex service and in one or more other local radio multiplex services such as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (b), taking the number of significant or intermittent services in those multiplex services together;<BR><BR>
</UL><P>
and for the purposes of this paragraph, two local radio multiplex services overlap if (but only if) the potential audience of either of those services includes 50 per cent. or more of the potential audience of the other service.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Subject to paragraph (5), in this article, "the relevant multiplex service" means the local radio multiplex service in which the further service is or is proposed to be included.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In the case of a local radio multiplex service by means of different parts of which different selections of local digital sound programme services are made available for reception in different areas, any reference, in relation to a local digital sound programme service, to a local radio multiplex service is a reference to that part of that multiplex service in which that programme service is or is proposed to be included; and references to the market area, the potential audience and the protected area of such a multiplex service shall be construed accordingly.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the purposes of this article, a local digital sound programme service is provided in the market area of the relevant multiplex service if its provision is, or is to be, by means of its inclusion in that multiplex service or in any other local radio multiplex service the potential audience of which includes at least 5 per cent. of the potential audience of the relevant multiplex service.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The Tables referred to in paragraph (2)(b) are as follows, and the number of points attributable to services provided by the relevant person shall be calculated according to Table 1, and the total number of points attributable to all local digital sound programme services provided in the market area of the relevant multiplex, whether by the relevant person or by any other person, shall be calculated according to Table 2, where the number of points attributable to each service of a description mentioned in an entry in the first column of a Table is the number of points shown in the corresponding entry in the second or third column (as the case may require) of that Table.<BR><BR>

<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Order)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
This Order is made under section 282 of, and Schedule 14 to, the Communications Act 2003. Part 2 contains limits on the number of local sound broadcasting licences that a person may hold in the circumstances described in the Order. Part 3 contains limits on the number of local digital sound programme services that a person may provide. Part 4 modifies other legislation to give full effect to the restrictions in the Communications Act 2003 on who may provide news services for regional Channel 3 services, and to alter and clarify the restrictions in that Act on holding local radio multiplex licences.<BR><BR>
Part 1 makes provision applicable to the rest of the Order. In particular, article 3 provides that a person connected with the actual holder of a licence, or with a person who actually provides a local digital sound programme service, is to be treated as if he, too, held that licence or provided that service. The question whether persons are "connected" for these purposes is to be answered by reference to the rules in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Broadcasting Act 1990 (c. 42). For example, two companies are "connected" if one controls the other (according to the definition of "control" in that Part of that Schedule) or if both are controlled by the same person.<BR><BR>
Part 2 makes rules applying to local (analogue) sound broadcasting services. Article 5 provides for a restriction where a person holds at least two such local radio licences that overlap with each other, that is to say, where the potential audience of either service includes at least one half of the potential audience of the other: see article 4(2). The restriction applies when that person seeks to acquire a further licence to provide a service which also overlaps in that manner with his two other overlapping services. In those circumstances, points are attributed to each licence under which that or any other person provides a service in the area. The points are set out in the table in article 8. The person seeking to hold the further licence may not do so if, were he to do so, he would then hold more than 55 per cent. of the total points attributable to all services in the area, applying the points test to each of his overlapping licences in that area in turn. Generally, the test is applied according to the points situation that would prevail immediately after the person concerned acquired the licence, but where the area served by any person's service changes while he is holding three overlapping licences, the test falls to be applied to his licences (but not those of any neighbouring licensee) again: see article 7.<BR><BR>
Article 6 provides for a separate and stricter limit where two licences overlap with each other and the person seeking to acquire the further overlapping licence is a person who runs a local newspaper (or newspapers) having 50 per cent. or more of the market share in the area covered by the service provided under the licence, or who holds a regional Channel 3 licence covering that area. A points system similar to that explained above applies, including provision applying when the area served changes (see article 7), but in a case falling within article 6, the person seeking to acquire the further licence may not have more than 45 per cent. of the total points.<BR><BR>
Article 9 prevents joint ownership in the same area of a local sound broadcasting licence, a regional Channel 3 licence and a local newspaper (or newspapers) having 50 per cent. or more of the market share in that area.<BR><BR>
Part 3 makes rules determining the number of local digital sound programme services that may be provided under local digital sound programme licences. The rules are based on the number of such services that are provided in the market area of a particular local radio multiplex service, that is to say, in the area covered when considering the local radio multiplex service on which a person is seeking to provide a new service, taken with any other local radio multiplex service (or services) whose potential audience includes at least 5 per cent. of the potential audience of the first multiplex service: see article 10(3). Points are attributed to all local digital sound programme services provided (by any person) in a market area, and the person may not provide the further service if, were he to do so, he would be providing services worth more than 55 per cent. of the total points attributable to all those services. The test is applied according to the points situation that would prevail immediately after the person concerned began to provide the service (if he did so). It does not apply to persons providing four services or fewer in a more narrowly-defined area (see article 11(3)). The points vary depending on (amongst other things) the hours for which a service is broadcast: see articles 11(8) and 12.<BR><BR>
Part 4 modifies other legislation. Article 13(1) is made under section 282 of the 2003 Act and amends section 281 of that Act. Section 281 specifies the persons who cannot be the appointed news provider for regional Channel 3 services: essentially, any person who could not hold a Channel 3 licence is debarred from being the news provider. The effect of the amendment is to debar a person who is the subject of a disqualification order made by a court on conviction of an offence under section 144 of the Broadcasting Act 1996 (c. 55) (providing false information in certain circumstances in connection with the rules preventing political bodies etc. from holding broadcasting licences). This was the intended effect of the amendment to section 145 of that Act of 1996 made by paragraph 140(3) of Schedule 15 to the 2003 Act, but that amendment erroneously relies for its effect upon a provision repealed elsewhere in that Act (section 32(12) of the Broadcasting Act 1990). Article 13(2) repeals that cross-reference.<BR><BR>
Article 14 replaces references to the "coverage area" of a local radio multiplex service with references to the "protected area" for such a service. It defines that expression in the same way as it is defined in Part 3 of this Order. That article also defines the expression "potential audience" for the purposes of paragraph 8 of Part 2 of Schedule 14 to the 2003 Act (restriction on holding local radio multiplex licences), under powers provided for in paragraph 10 of that Part of that Schedule. That expression is currently undefined in that Part. Since this Order defines "potential audience" differently as between Part 2 and Part 3 of the Order, the purpose of this amendment is to add clarity to paragraph 8 of Schedule 14 by specifying the definition that is to apply there. Article 14(2) repeals paragraph 8(2) of that Schedule, since that defines "coverage area", an expression that will no longer be used in that paragraph.<BR><BR>
