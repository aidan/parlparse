<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These regulations amend the Employment Zones Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/721) by changing the areas designated as employment zones from areas based on wards and electoral divisions to larger areas based on local authority districts. They also make clear that the boundaries of the zones correspond to the boundaries of the districts as they stand at the date these amending regulations are made and hence any boundary changes made in respect of the districts will not have the effect of changing the boundaries of the employment zones.<BR><BR>
Had the areas of the zones not been changed an amendment to the principal Regulations would, in any event, have been required because of errors in the schedule.<BR><BR>
