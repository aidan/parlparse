<a name="ex">EXPLANATORY NOTE
</b><br/><br/><i>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</i></center><br/><br/>
These Regulations set out the categories of persons who are disqualified from registration in England as child minders or providers of day care. Persons disqualified under these Regulations may not act as childminders or provide day care. Nor may they be employed in connection with day care provision or directly concerned in the management of any provision of day care.<br/><br/>
The Regulations set out the circumstances in which disqualification may be waived either wholly or in part e.g. for the purposes of employment at a day care provider or direct involvement in management.<br/><br/>
The Regulations apply to applications for registration made under Part XA of the Children Act 1989. A right of appeal lies to the Care Standards Tribunal in relation to any determination made by the registration authority under these Regulations by virtue of Regulation 11.<br/><br/>
A Full Regulatory Impact Assessment, which sets out the background and reasons for these regulations, has been completed . This is available from Paul Oates, Early Years Regulation Team, Sure Start Unit, GF Caxton House, Tothill Street, London SW1H 9NA, Telephone 0207 273 5686, <a href="MAILTO:Paul.OATES@dfes.gsi.gov.uk">email: Paul.OATES@dfes.gsi.gov.uk.</a><br/><br/>
