This Order amends the Gas Act 1986 (Exemptions) (No. 4) Order 1996 (S.I. 1996/2795), so as to extend its duration to 1st March 2011 (instead of 31st December 2000). (That Order had previously been amended by the Gas Act 1986 (Exemptions) (No. 4) (Amendment) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/3026) which extended its duration from 30th November 1999 to 31st December 2000).<BR><BR>
The 1996 Order provides that a person who conveys gas through pipes from the Gas Treatments Plant at the Connah's Quay Power Station, Deeside, to a pipe-line system operated by a public gas transporter is exempted from the prohibition on the conveyance of gas without a licence. The prohibition is contained in section 5(1)(a) of the Gas Act 1986, and the Secretary of State's power to make such an exemption is contained in section 6A of the Gas Act 1986.<BR><BR>
