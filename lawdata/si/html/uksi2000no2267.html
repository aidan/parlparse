These Rules amend the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 in two main respects.<BR><BR>
Rule 10 inserts a new rule 10.26, providing a procedural code for cases concerning the Human Rights Act 1998.<BR><BR>
Rule 9 substitutes a new rule 2.70, concerning applications for ancillary relief in cases where one or both parties have pension rights; the new rule provides a procedural code for applications for pension sharing and pension attachment orders. The remaining rules make other amendments concerned with ancillary relief and pensions.<BR><BR>
Rule 10 comes into force on 2nd October 2000, to coincide with the commencement of the Human Rights Act 1998; the remainder of these Rules comes into force on 1st December 2000, to coincide with the introduction of pension sharing.<BR><BR>
