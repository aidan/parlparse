</B><BR><BR><I>
(This note is not part of the Regulations)</I></CENTER><BR><BR>
These Regulations specify requirements for the purposes of section 6(1) of the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 ("the Act"). They apply to advertisements for tobacco products (other than advertisements for cigarettes or hand rolling tobacco) which are in, or fixed to the outside of, the premises of specialist tobacconists. Where a specialist tobacconist complies with section 6(1), he does not commit an offence under section 2 (prohibition of tobacco advertising) of the Act.<BR><BR>
These Regulations apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish Ministers are making similar regulations for Scotland.<BR><BR>
Regulation 2 requires that each advertisement to which these Regulations apply must include a health warning and health information on the NHS Smoking Helpline (paragraphs (1) to (3)). Different health warnings apply depending on whether the advertisement in question is mainly for smoking or other tobacco products (paragraph (3)). Where the advertisement exceeds 75cm2, the health warning and health information must occupy an area of at least 22.5cm2 and in any other case not less than 30% of the advertisement (paragraph (4)). This is consistent with the size of the warnings on packets of tobacco products. The format of the health warning and health information is specified (paragraph (5)).<BR><BR>
A Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared for these Regulations and a copy has been placed in the library of each House of Parliament. Copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment are published on the Department's website (<a  href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a>) and can be obtained from Room 706, Department of Health, Wellington House, 133-155 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8UG.<BR><BR>
