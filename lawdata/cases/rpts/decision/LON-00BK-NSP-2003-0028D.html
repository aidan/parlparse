House (“the Block”) is a 21-storey block of flats built in the 1960’s. It
comprises 125 flats and maisonettes of which 23 have been sold under the right
to buy legislation. The remaining flats continue to be occupied by secure
tenants. The Applicant purchased the flat on 14<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span>
April 1999. The Block is one of 3 tower blocks which, together with a number of
low-rise blocks, form part of the Respondent’s Warwick Estate (“the Estate”).
For some years the Estate has been managed on behalf of the Respondent by
Paddington Churches Housing Association (“PCHA”).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>On the basis of the Applicant’s evidence (which in this
respect was not disputed) the communal lighting in the Block was, until 1999,
centrally controlled. It was only turned on when it was dark. The Applicant
said that, taking the year as a whole, the communal lighting was switched on
for approximately 12 hours per day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>In 1999 substantial electrical works were carried out to
the Block and the mechanism for controlling the communal lighting was removed,
although whether this was deliberate or accidental was not clear. However it
was common ground that, from the date of those works, the communal lighting was
left on permanently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>The Applicant objected to this policy on the basis that it
resulted in an increase in the cost of providing the communal lighting which
was inherently unreasonable. On 27<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>December 2000 the Respondent rejected the
objection saying that the Residents Association had agreed that the lighting
should be kept on at all times “because it uses less electricity and is
therefore cheaper to run”. The Applicant persisted with his objection.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Respondent then treated the objection as
a complaint and dealt with it under its three-stage complaints procedure. At
each stage the Respondent rejected the complaint. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>On 5<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span> March 2001, at
the first stage, the Respondent said that the cost differential was “less than
3 pence per lamp per <span class=SpellE>anum</span>” and that a majority of the
residents were content “with the lighting arrangements and the added security
that it provides”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>On 5<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span> April 2001, at
the second stage, the Respondent produced a copy of a report prepared by a Mr
Brennan of Southern Consultants Ltd dated 31<span class=SpellE><sup>st</sup></span>
January 2001 (“the Report”). On the basis of the Report it said that a lamp
left on permanently would cost “in the region £13.50 …per year” more than one
switched on for 15 hours continuously per day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However as the lights “operate on a photo cell, which monitors the
ambient light conditions” it was impossible to make a valid comparison. It said
that the lights were left on continuously at the request of the Residents
Association and it repeated the concerns over security.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>On 21<span class=SpellE><sup>st</sup></span> May 2001, at
the third stage, the Respondent repeated the points made previously saying “To
obtain any revised <span class=SpellE>costings</span> based on the use of a
photo cell is going to be extremely difficult and it is dubious as to whether
this can be done with any degree of accuracy”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>The Applicant believing that his grievance had not been
adequately addressed referred the matter to the Local Authority Ombudsman who
declined to deal with it on the basis that his remedy was to make an
application to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. The Applicant made his
application but a differently constituted Tribunal declined jurisdiction on the
basis that, in respect of the year in dispute, he had paid the service charge
in full. On the 26<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span> July 2003 he made the
application now before the Tribunal in respect of the interim or estimated
service charge accounts for the period from 1<span class=SpellE><sup>st</sup></span>
April 2003 to 30<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span> September 2003. In
respect of the demand based upon those accounts the Applicant had not paid the
charge for Communal Electricity which amounted to £2,140 in respect of the
Block, of which his share was £10.87.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>At a pre-trial review on 29<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span>
August 2003 a differently constituted Tribunal issued directions. The
directions had in the main been complied with. The Tribunal issuing the
directions considered that an inspection of the Block would probably not be
necessary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The directions authorised the
Tribunal to consider requiring the Respondents to reimburse the Applicants with
the whole or part of their fees under article 8 of the Leasehold Valuation
Tribunal (Fees) order 1997.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

10.0pt;color:black'>The Applicant’s lease dated 14<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span>
April 1999 (“the Lease”) is in a standard form. The Respondent’s relevant
obligations or functions are set out in Clauses 4 and 6 and the Ninth Schedule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>Clause 3 of the Ninth Schedule requires the Respondent “To
keep adequately lighted all such parts of the Reserved Property as are normally
lighted or should be lighted…..”. The Reserved Property is defined in the Third
Schedule and includes “the halls staircases lifts (if any) landings steps
passages or other parts of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(the Block)
which are used in common by the owners or occupiers of any of the Flats forming
part of (the Block )”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>Clause 6(A)(ii) of the Lease entitles the Respondent “to
employ architects surveyors solicitors accountants contractors builders
gardeners and any other person or company properly required to be employed in
connection with or for the purpose of or in relation to the Estate or the
Property or any part thereof and pay them all proper fees charges salaries
wages costs expenses and <span class=SpellE>outgoings</span>”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>The Respondent’s financial year runs from 1<sup> <span
class=SpellE>st</span></sup> April in any year. In essence the Lease provides
that the Applicant must pay a fair and reasonable proportion of the estimated
costs to be incurred by the Respondent in carrying out the obligations or
functions referred to in Clauses 4 and 6 and in performing the covenants set
out in the Ninth Schedule. This interim charge is to be paid by two instalments
on 1<span class=SpellE><sup>st</sup></span> April and 1<span class=SpellE><sup>st</sup></span>
October in each financial year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>Although not specifically stated it is clear intended that,
at the end of each financial year, the Respondent should prepare an account
detailing the actual expenditure incurred during that year. If the interim
charge paid by the Applicant is less than his share of the actual expenditure
then the shortfall is payable upon demand. If the interim charge exceeds the
Applicant’s share of the actual expenditure then the surplus is carried forward
and credited to the Applicant’s account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>“A fair and reasonable proportion” is not defined in the
Lease but in practice it is calculated by reference to the total number of bed
spaces in either the Block or the Estate depending upon the nature of the
expenditure. Communal Electricity is a Block cost and the Applicant pays 0.508%
of all such costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>There are provisions in the Lease which were presumably
intended to protect Right to Buy tenants during an initial five-year period.
During that period the estimated costs to be taken into account in calculating
the interim charge is fixed by reference to the sums set out in Part I of the
Tenth Schedule. That Schedule provides that the Block Electricity cost shall be
the equivalent of £3,832.50 per half year rather than the sum of £2,140
actually charged to the estimated service charge account for the half year from
1<span class=SpellE><sup>st</sup></span> April 2003 to 30<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span>
September 2003. That would result, ironically, in the Applicant having to pay
almost twice the sum in dispute. The Respondent did not however seek to rely
upon these provisions and it would have been inappropriate for it to do so. In
any event as the law stood at the date of the application it would not have
been an issue for the Tribunal relating as it did to the recoverability of the
sum in dispute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

10.0pt;color:black'>The Applicant’s case was simply put. Since 1999 he had
never seen the communal lights turned off and he doubted that they were
operated by means of a photo cell. A light left on for 24 hours will cost twice
as much as one left on for 12 hours. There was no good reason to leave the
lights on permanently: the additional cost was inherently unreasonable and half
the Communal Electricity Charges should be disallowed: that is £1,070 in
respect of the Block of which his share was £5.44.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>He accepted that he was the only tenant in the Block to
object to the Communal Electricity charges. He did not know if the Residents
Association had been consulted although if it had he rather doubted that it was
prior to the change of policy in 1999. He did not accept that the sum in
dispute was trivial: it might only be some £5.44 per half year from his point
of view but for the Block as a whole the sum in dispute amounted to £2,140.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>He considered that the safety concerns had been overplayed.

permanently and hence the expenditure on two grounds: firstly that it addressed
a genuine security issue on the Estate and secondly that PCHA had consulted the
Residents Association which was in agreement with the policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

blocks, was reported about every two weeks. More often than not it was nuisance
behaviour caused by children but there had been rapes and burglaries. The
natural lighting in the common parts was poor and leaving the communal lighting
on permanently created a more secure environment. Consequently the policy and
hence the cost was reasonable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

installing time clocks which was difficult to quantify. The time clocks would
have to be changed and inspected twice a year and under the existing
maintenance contract there would be a cost of £16 per year in respect of each
time clock: she was not competent to say how many time clocks would be
required. One also had to factor in the reduction, referred to in the Report,
of about 5% in the life of a light which is switched on and off twice a day.
Although not an expert she thought that if the total electricity charges
incurred in operating the communal lights amounted to £4,280 per year a saving
of about £1,800 could be achieved by installing time clocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to this point in Ms White’s evidence it had been assumed by all concerned that
the Communal Electricity charges related solely to the cost of the communal
lighting. However in response to enquires from the Tribunal it became apparent
that this was not the case. The Communal Electricity charges included in the
Service Charge accounts included also the cost of running the Lifts and the
security cameras and the cleaning appliances used to clean the common parts. One
meter supplied all the electricity to the common parts and it was impossible to
say what proportion, for example, related to the lifts or to the communal
lighting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

necessary to inspect the Block, notwithstanding the comment in the directions.
It did so for the purpose of establishing the level of natural light in the

inconclusive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lift <span class=SpellE>sto</span> <span class=SpellE>ps</span> on every second
floor. On each such floor a long narrow corridor runs the length of the Block
with a large window at each end. There is no other source of natural light. The
lift shaft is to one end of the Block. On every second floor the two lifts
opens to a lobby and from the other side of that lobby a door leads to an
emergency stairwell. Anyone could gain access to the lobbies and stairwell and
they clearly present a security risk. However given the proximity of the end
windows the natural lighting in both the lobbies and the stairwell is adequate
and additional lighting during daylight hours would do little to enhance
security<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

security door gives access to the corridor from which entry to the individual

that each corridor provides a secure environment. Consequently it seems
difficult to argue that additional lighting is required during daylight hours
to address a genuine security issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

prevailing sense of gloom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

obtained if the communal lighting were regulated by a time clock. However it
was impossible to estimate the extent of that saving because all the communal
electricity charges were monitored by one meter. On the basis of the evidence
it would not be great. Allowing for the cost of running the lifts, security
cameras and cleaning appliances it was unlikely to exceed £1,000 per year and
in all probability it would be less than that figure. The saving to each tenant
would be no more than about £2.50 per year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

10.0pt;color:black'>Between 1995/96 and 2001/02 the Respondent had halved the
cost of communal electricity by adopting an aggressive policy of competitive
tendering. If a Tribunal had been requested to determine the issue in 1995/96,
when the communal lighting was regulated by a time clock, it would no doubt
have concluded that the cost was reasonable; the electricity being metered and
supplied by a reputable contractor. For the Tribunal to conclude that the
estimated cost of the communal electricity in 2003/04 was unreasonable, when
the actual cost had been halved, would be perverse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>Section 19 of the Act does not require a landlord to ensure
that the cost, for any particular service, is as low as possible but rather
that the cost is reasonable. For any particular service there will always be a
band of reasonable cost and provided that the actual or estimated cost falls
within that band it will be reasonable. Viewed in that light the Tribunal
concluded that the cost estimated by the Respondent to be incurred, in the
provision of communal electricity during the period 1<span class=SpellE><sup>st</sup></span>
April 2003 to 30<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span> September 2003, was
reasonable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>The Tribunal next had to consider the application under
Section 20C of the Act to limit the recoverability of the Respondent’s costs
incurred, in these proceedings, through the service charge. The Tribunal had
requested the Respondent to provide a schedule of its costs but despite a reminder
this had not been forthcoming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>The Tribunal was not persuaded by Mr <span class=SpellE>Pryce’s</span>
argument relating to The Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Taken to its
logical conclusion the argument would deny long leaseholders, in a mixed local
authority block such as this, a remedy granted by Parliament under the Act.
That was an untenable proposition. Furthermore the Tribunal was not wholly
convinced that the inevitable consequence of such an order was that the cost
should fall on the secure tenants. An order under section 20C was in the nature
of a sanction, the cost of which should surely and more appropriately be born
by the authority’s general funds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>Nevertheless the Tribunal accepted that, having found in
favour of the Respondent on the substantive issue, it should only make an order
under section 20C in exceptional circumstances and where it was just and
equitable to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>The Respondent’s conduct in dealing with the Applicant’s
initial complaint left a great deal to be desired. It had persistently stated
that a photo cell regulated the communal lighting: a statement which, on the
evidence of Ms White, was plainly wrong. Its initial argument, that it was
cheaper to leave the lights on permanently appeared insupportable. On the 3<sup>rd</sup>
March 2001 it had stated that the cost differential was “less than 3 pence per
lamp per year”: a statement which seemed irreconcilable with the Report which
must, at that date, have been in its possession although not disclosed until a
later date. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal found,
as a fact, that the Respondent had not consulted the Residents Association
until after the removal of the time clocks in 1999: its assertion to the
contrary in its letter to Applicant of 5<span class=SpellE><sup>th</sup></span>
April 2000 was unhelpful. Even when it did consult the Residents Association it
is apparent, from the Association’s letter of 1<span class=SpellE><sup>st</sup></span>
October 2003, that there had not been a full disclosure of all the available
information (although this should not be regarded as a criticism of Ms White
who gave her evidence in an exemplary manner).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>The Respondent could have addressed the Applicant’s
concerns at an earlier stage but had failed to do so. It had failed to consider
that one meter controlled the total communal electricity supply and that the
electricity charges in the service charge accounts did not relate only to the
communal lighting. It had not considered drawing the Applicant’s attention to
the savings that had been achieved in recent years by its policy of price
competitive tendering. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>The Applicant had only made his application after exploring
every other available option and he had done so, in effect, at the suggestion
of the Local Authority Ombudsman who, had s/he been in possession of all the
facts before the Tribunal, might well have been inclined to deal with the
referral.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>Taking all these factors into account the Tribunal
concluded that it would it would be just and equitable to make an order under
section 20C of the Act even though it had found in the Respondent’s favour on
the substantive issue. The Tribunal therefore ordered that the Respondent would
not be entitled to recover any of its costs incurred in these proceedings under
the service charge provisions of the leases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:black'>Finally the Tribunal had to consider whether to order the
Respondent to reimburse the Applicant the whole or part of his fees of £500. It
was one thing to deny the Respondent’s the recovery of their costs it was
another to require them to reimburse the whole of the Applicant’s fees. The
Applicant had after all pursued an application which most people would consider
