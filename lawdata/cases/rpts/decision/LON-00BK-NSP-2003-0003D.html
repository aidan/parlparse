the request of the Respondent, formed Hamilton Court Leaseholders Association
(the Association). The Association was formally recognised by the Respondent
by a letter dated 18<sup>th</sup> April 1985. Mr Wayne is the owner-occupier of
flat 14 and has, at all times, been the Chairman of the Association.</span></p>

a constitution which provided for an opt-in membership and payment of a small
subscription to cover administration charges. However many lessees chose not to
participate in the affairs of the Association and over time the constitution
fell into disuse: all lessees were deemed to be members and the subscription
was dropped. Ultimately the Association came under the control of a
self-perpetuating committee: there was an Annual Meeting to which all lessees
were invited but few attended and the committee members did not offer
themselves for re-election.</span></p>

these arrangements and on any objective assessment he was entitled to be so.
However, on the basis of Mr Waynes evidence, the current situation is a
product of the general apathy of the majority of the lessees who have, until
recently, taken no interest in the affairs of the Association. The Applicant
himself could have played an active role in the affairs of the Association but
chose not to do so. It seemed to the Tribunal a little unreasonable that he
should now criticise those who, for many years, without remuneration or thanks
have done their best to represent the interests of the lessees. </span></p>

Fine of 14/16 Stephenson Way, London NW1 2HD as managing agents. However they
played no part in these proceedings and their role seems to be an
administrative one. Certainly the Respondent adopts a very hands on approach
to the management of Hamilton Court. It seemed to the Tribunal that the
Respondent has perhaps failed to fully appreciate that with the sale of most of
the flats the equity in Hamilton Court has effectively passed beyond its
control. That is perhaps not surprising given its long association with
Hamilton Court.</span></p>

principal arguments was that the refurbishment of the ground floor reception
area amounted to an improvement: under the terms of the Lease the Respondent
could not recover any costs incurred in carrying out improvements. His argument
required the Tribunal to interpret the terms of the Lease and that was not
currently within its jurisdiction: the Tribunal could only determine the
reasonableness of the costs incurred. The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act
2002 (CLRA) extended the Tribunals jurisdiction in such a way that it would
in future be able to interpret the terms of any lease under consideration. The
relevant provisions of CLRA have not however been brought into effect. It was
anticipated that the confirming order, bringing them into effect, would be
introduced in July 2003. He therefore requested that the hearing be adjourned

Harrisons argument. Furthermore the Applicant was not denied a remedy. The
Respondent would no doubt sue for the arrears and the Applicant could defend

provide porterage facilities.</span></p>

pointed out that no provision for the cost had been included in the estimate

insurance contributions. He assumed, not unreasonably, that the additional
cost of £7,492 must have resulted from Mr Cranes absence. In the alternative
he disputed the reasonableness of the cost on the basis that the contract had

it was the act of a responsible employer. She also asserted that it was

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>As to the cost of the cleaning
contract Ms Slowe explained that the Respondent had until 1999 employed an
under porter at Hamilton Court. In 1999 the Respondent came to the conclusion
that the services provide by the under porter could be carried out more
effectively by contract cleaners. There had not been a process of competitive
tender but Gross Fine had researched the market and were of the opinion that
the quotation submitted by Golden Office Cleaning Services was competitive. She
said that the contract cost had been included in the service charge accounts
since 1999. She explained that the global figure of £25,000 included in the
2001/2 estimate covered both Mr Cranes wages and the cleaning contract cost:
she drew the Tribunals attention to the previous years service charge account
which recorded a total cost of £24,045 for porterage and cleaning. </span></p>

the Respondent had acted reasonably in continuing to pay Mr Cranes wages
during his illness. It was entitled to recover those wages, through the service
charge, under the provisions of the Lease. Its profitability and the apparent
wealth of its shareholders was wholly irrelevant. In reaching this conclusion
the Tribunal was fortified by the Applicants acceptance, under
cross-examination, that he alone of the lessees objected to this cost.</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>With regard to the cost of
using Golden Office Cleaning Services to provide cover for Mr Crane, the
Applicants argument relied on an interpretation of sub-clause 5(7)(i) of the Lease
which was currently beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Nevertheless to
the extent that the Respondent was obliged to use its best endeavours to
provide porterage facilities it was entirely reasonable that the Respondent
should hire independent contractors to provide short-term emergency cover.
Whilst the Applicant may have a point it is not a practical one: in reality any
other option would almost certainly have left the residents without porterage
facilities for a number of months. Insurance cover did not strike the Tribunal
as a realistic option and in any event it was a case of swings and
roundabouts: over the years the premiums, which would have been recovered from
the lessees, would no doubt have equalled the costs in dispute.</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>As to the cost of the cleaning
contract the Tribunal had considerable sympathy for the Applicant to the extent
that the 2001/2 estimate had clearly caused a degree of confusion: the Tribunal
had been confused until Ms Slowe had provided an explanation. The Applicant,
however, had produced no evidence to show that the cost was inherently
unreasonable. The contract had been in place since 1999 and had not previously
been challenged: the cost for 2001/2 was consistent with the cost for the
previous year. Certainly the cost did not strike the Tribunal as being
unreasonable and it accepted Ms Slowes evidence which had not been challenged.
The Tribunal therefore concluded that the costs had been reasonably incurred.</span></p>

stairwells the estimated cost was put at £22,000. As has been observed the
Respondent does not operate a reserve fund to cover expenditure of this type.
However following representations made by the Association it agreed to collect
the estimated costs over two years. Accordingly £11,000 was included in the
estimated service charge expenditure for 2000/1 with the intention that the
balance would be collected in the following year. However the work was not
carried out during that year. The £11,000 should have been set aside; instead
it was used to defray other costs actually incurred in that year. The lessees

extent of the new mirrors had been scaled back: the light fittings had been
renovated rather than replaced in their entirety: the proposed radiator covers
had been omitted from the scheme. The broadloom carpet had been fitted at the
request of the Association. Although more expensive than originally planned it

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>The Tribunal next had to
consider the application under Section 20C of the Act to limit the
recoverability of the Respondents costs incurred, in these proceedings,
through the service charge. Through Miss Harrison, Miss Wilkinson produced a
breakdown of the Respondents costs which totalled £15,407.19 inclusive of
VAT.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Having regard to the decision in St
Marys Mansions Ltd V Limegate Investment Co Ltd ((2003) 05 EG 146) the
Tribunal doubted that the provisions of the Lease recited at paragraph 20 would
entitle the Respondent to recover its legal costs incurred in these
proceedings. Nevertheless as the law now stands the interpretation of the Lease
is not a matter for the Tribunal. It therefore considered it appropriate to
consider the application on its merits leaving it to others to determine the
recoverability of the Respondents costs.</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>The Tribunal had considerable
sympathy for the Applicant. His application had not been frivolous. He had
restricted his arguments to a small number of issues in an attempt to reduce
costs. The Respondents decision to close down communications rather than
provide a full explanation to the Applicant had been unhelpful. The
Respondents failure to separate out the porterage costs from the cleaning
contract costs in the 2001/2 estimate had caused considerable confusion. The
Respondents mistake in failing to set aside the money, collected in 2000/1, to
defray the cost of internal decorations, had left the lessees with a false sense
of security and had caused a degree of justifiable resentment. The Tribunal was
surprised and disappointed that the Respondent had been unaware of the RICS
Residential Management Code. </span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>Taking these factors into
account and having regard to the decision of P R Francis FRICS in Maryland
Estates Limited v Patsy Anne Lynch and David Wilson (2002) LRX/57/1999 the
Tribunal concluded that it would it would be just and equitable to make a
limited order under section 20C of the Act even though it had found in the
Respondents favour under every head of expenditure in issue. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:-36.0pt;line-height:

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>The Tribunal considered that
the correct approach was to consider the reasonableness of the Respondents
costs. His Honour Judge Rich had said in Tenants of Langford Court v Doren
Limited (2001) (LT) LRX/37/2000 that Section 20C may provide a short route by
which a tribunal which has heard the litigation giving rise to the costs can
avoid arguments under s19. To do otherwise would result in a second set of
proceedings and in a differently constituted tribunal considering costs which
the Tribunal was uniquely qualified to judge, having heard the case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:54.0pt;text-indent:-36.0pt;line-height:

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>The Tribunal considered that
the costs incurred by the Respondent were wholly disproportionate both to the
sums in issue and the nature of the case, which was not complex. The Respondent
was perfectly entitled to be represented by both barrister and solicitor. It
did not automatically follow that it was reasonable that the consequential
costs should be visited on the lessees. Specialist tribunals such as the
Leasehold Valuation Tribunal had been created, in part, to offer members of the
public a cost effective remedy without the attendant high cost culture that is
so much a feature of civil litigation. That did not mean that the cost of both
barrister and solicitor would never be reasonable incurred. In complex cases
involving issues of law their costs would no doubt be reasonably incurred. That
was not the case here. Cases of this nature were routinely conducted by
surveyors at costs in the region of £3,000 to £4,000. That seemed more
appropriate for a case presented to a specialist tribunal able to rely, to an
extent, upon its own knowledge and experience. The Tribunal would therefore
limit the Respondents costs that may be recovered under the service charge
provisions of the Lease, to £4,000 plus VAT.</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span lang=EN-GB>Finally the Tribunal had to
consider whether to order the Respondent to reimburse the Applicant the whole
or part of his fees of £150. The Applicant having failed to obtain any
reduction in the service charge costs the Tribunal did not consider that it
would be appropriate to make such an order.</span></p>
