 means the programme formulated by the Secretary of State under subsection (1) above subject to any modifications under subsection (7) below.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;Without prejudice to subsections (1) and (2) above, the disposal programme shall contain&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;a statement of the general approach which the Secretary of State intends that the Group should adopt in carrying out the disposals for which the programme provides (including the intended time table for implementing the programme); and</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;a description of the measures (if any) which the Secretary of State proposes should be taken for the purpose of preparing for any such disposals by way of reorganisation of the structure or operations of the Group and any of their subsidiaries.</ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (5)(b) above, the measures there mentioned may include the formation or promotion of new subsidiaries and the reconstruction, amalgamation, dissolution or winding up of any existing subsidiaries.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;The Secretary of State may from time to time, at the request of the Group or on his own initiative, make such modifications in the disposal programme as, after consultation with the Group, he thinks fit.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;The exercise by the Secretary of State of his powers under subsections (1) and (7) above requires the consent of the Treasury. </td>

<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;to the effect which he estimates the implementation of any part of the programme will have on the net value that may be expected to be secured from all disposals required under the programme, where that value is the excess of the aggregate proceeds arising from all disposals so required over the aggregate costs incurred in carrying out the programme and taking any other steps required in preparation for the dissolution of the Group.</ul>
