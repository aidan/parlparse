<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="3"></a>3. - (1) The amount of the adjustment is calculated as follows.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>First step</I><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add together any amounts representing the extent to which, comparing the two bases, profits were understated (or losses overstated) on the old basis:<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>2. Expenses which on the new basis fall to be brought into account in computing the profits of a period after the change, to the extent that they were brought into account in computing the profits of a period of account before the change of basis.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>3. Deductions in respect of opening trading stock or opening work in progress in the first period of account on the new basis to the extent to which they are not matched by credits in respect of closing trading stock or closing work in progress in the last period of account before the change.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><I>Second step</I><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then deduct any amounts representing the extent to which, comparing the two bases, profits were overstated (or losses understated) on the old basis:<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>1. Receipts which were taken into account in a period before the change, to the extent that they would not have been taken into account for such a period if the profits had been computed on the new basis.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>2. Expenses which were not taken into account in computing the profits of a period before the change, to the extent that they would have been taken into account for such a period if the profits had been computed on the new basis.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>3. Credits in respect of closing trading stock or closing work in progress in the last period of account before the change of accounting basis to the extent to which they are not matched by deductions in respect of opening trading stock or opening work in progress in the first period of account on the new basis.</UL></TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>An amount so deducted may not be deducted again in computing the profits of a period of account.</UL></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top> <I>Third step</I><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a profession or vocation adopting a new accounting basis to comply with section 42 (true and fair view), a further deduction may be made by way of adjustment in respect of any change of accounting basis before 6th April 1999.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount deductible is calculated as follows- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>A. Add together the amounts by which profits were overstated (or losses understated) by reason of the previous change of accounting basis:</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD valign=top><UL><UL>2. Expenses to the extent that by reason of the change of accounting basis they were not deducted in any period of account.</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL><UL>3. Credits in respect of closing trading stock or closing work in progress in the last period of account before the change of accounting basis to the extent that they were not matched by deductions in respect of opening trading stock or opening work in progress in the first period of account following the change.</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>B. Then deduct the amounts by which profits were understated (or losses overstated) by reason of that change:</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL><UL>1. Receipts to the extent that by reason of the change of accounting basis they were not brought into account in any period of account.</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL><UL>2. Expenses to the extent that by reason of the change of accounting basis they were deducted in more than one period of account.</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL><UL>3. Deductions in respect of opening trading stock or opening work in progress in the first period of account following the change of accounting basis to the extent that they were not matched by credits in respect of closing trading stock or closing work in progress in the last period of account before the change.</UL></UL></TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>An amount may not be so deducted if it has previously been brought into account; and it may not be deducted again on a subsequent change of accounting basis.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>For the purposes of paragraph (a) a trade, profession or vocation is not regarded as the same if section 113(1) or 337(1) of the Taxes Act 1988 applies (deemed discontinuance on change of persons carrying on trade, profession or vocation).</UL></TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD><TD align=center><BR><I>Spreading of adjustment charge in certain cases</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="4"></a>4. - (1) This paragraph provides for the spreading of the adjustment charge in certain cases where an individual- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) has been entitled to compute the profits of a profession or vocation on a basis that does not comply with section 42 of this Act (true and fair view), or would not have complied with that section if it had been in force, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) 10 per cent. of the profits of the profession or vocation for that year of assessment,</UL></TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>is treated as arising and chargeable to tax.<BR>&nbsp;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A claim is ineffective if the amount claimed exceeds the amount available for surrender at the time the claim is made.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For these purposes the amount available for surrender at any time is calculated as follows.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where notice of consent by the surrendering company relates to a loss in respect of which relief has been given under section 393(1) of the Taxes Act 1988 (carry forward of trading losses), the surrendering company must at the same time amend its company tax return for the period or, if more than one, each of the periods in which relief for that loss has been given under section 393(1) so as to reflect the new notice of consent.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
