<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In determining for the purpose of sub-paragraph (2)(d) whether a gain accruing on the hypothetical disposal referred to would have been a chargeable gain, the requirements of paragraph 18(1)(b) and of paragraph 19(1)(b) (requirement as to company invested in to be met immediately after the disposal) shall be assumed to be met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(c) that earlier disposal took place within the relevant period,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>sub-paragraph (1) does not prevent a gain accruing to company A on the disposal from being a chargeable gain but any loss so accruing is not an allowable loss.</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where assets of company B are vested in a liquidator under section 145 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or Article 123 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 or otherwise, sub-paragraph (5)(a) applies as if the assets were vested in the company.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In determining "the relevant period" for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2)(d) or (e) or sub-paragraph (5)(c), section 28 (time of disposal under contract) applies with the omission of subsection (2) (postponement of time of disposal in case of conditional contract).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(c) section 192(2)(a) (distribution not treated as capital distribution).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply to a disposal of shares if the effect of its applying would be that relief attributable to the shares under Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2000 (corporate venturing scheme) would be withdrawn or reduced under paragraph 46 of that Schedule (withdrawal or reduction of investment relief on disposal of shares).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where or to the extent that an exemption conferred by this Schedule does apply- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the provisions mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a) and (b) do not apply in relation to the disposal, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where section 127 is disapplied by sub-paragraph (3)(a) in a case in which that section would otherwise have applied in relation to the disposal by virtue of paragraph 84 of Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2000 (corporate venturing scheme: share exchanges), paragraph 85 of that Schedule (attribution of relief to new shares) does not apply.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The first condition is that the sole or main purpose of the partnership is to invest in unquoted shares or securities.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition shall not be regarded as met unless it appears from- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the agreement constituting the partnership, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) any prospectus issued to prospective partners,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>that that is the sole or main purpose of the partnership.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The second condition is that the partnership does not carry on a trade.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The third condition is that not less than 90&#37; of the book value of the partnership's investments is attributable to investments that are either- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) shares or securities that were unquoted at the time of their acquisition by the partnership, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) shares that were quoted at the time of their acquisition by the partnership but which it was reasonable to believe would cease to be quoted within the next twelve months.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of the third condition- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the following shall be disregarded- </UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL><UL>(i) any holding of cash, including cash deposited in a bank account or similar account but not cash acquired wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain on its disposal;</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) whether the 90&#37; test is met shall be determined by reference to the values shown in the partnership's accounts at the end of a period of account of the partnership.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where a partnership ceases to meet the above conditions, the company shall be treated as if the partnership had continued to be a venture capital investment partnership until the end of the period of account of the partnership during which it ceased to meet the conditions.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) A partnership that ceases to meet those conditions cannot qualify again as a venture capital investment partnership.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>For this purpose a partnership is treated as the same partnership notwithstanding a change in membership if any person who was a member before the change remains a member.<BR></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Instead- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the company's interest in relevant assets of the partnership is treated as a single asset ("the single asset") acquired by the company when it became a member of the partnership, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the following provisions of this Schedule have effect.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of this Schedule the "relevant assets" of the partnership are the shares and securities held by the partnership, other than qualifying corporate bonds.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Nothing in this Schedule shall be read- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any further amounts of capital contributed by it to the partnership are treated on a disposal of the single asset as expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively on the asset for the purpose of enhancing its value and reflected in its state or nature at the time of the disposal.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the investments of the partnership include qualifying corporate bonds, the amount to be taken into account under sub-paragraph (1) or (2) is proportionately reduced.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The reduction is made by applying to that amount the fraction:

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4) the "book value" means the value shown in the partnership's accounts at the end of the period of account.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The disposal is taken to be for a consideration equal to the amount of the distribution or of so much of it as does not consist of income or the proceeds of sale or redemption of assets that are not relevant assets.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the partnership disposes of relevant assets on which a chargeable gain or allowable loss would accrue if they were held by the company alone, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) no distribution of the proceeds of the disposal is made within twelve months of the disposal,</UL></TD></TR>
