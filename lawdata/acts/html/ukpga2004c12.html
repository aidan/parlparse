<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjustment in respect of losses is a deduction of the amount which, disregarding sections 434A(2) and 440B, would fall to be set off under section 393 against the company's income for that period if the company had always been charged to tax under Case I of Schedule D in respect of its life assurance business.</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) at the time the payment is made, the company making the payment reasonably believes that section 98 applies to the payment,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>the company may, if it thinks fit, make the payment without deduction of tax under section 349(1).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) But if section 98 does not in fact apply to the payment, section 350 of, and Schedule 16 to, the Taxes Act 1988 (charge to tax where payments are made under section 349 etc) are to have effect as if subsection (1) never applied in relation to the payment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the Board are not satisfied that section 98 will apply to one or more payments of royalties to be made by a company, they may direct the company that subsection (1) is not to apply to the payment or payments.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>it must without delay notify the Board and the company which is to make the payment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998 (c. 36) (requirement to make return in respect of information relevant to application of Corporation Tax Acts) has effect as if the reference to the Corporation Tax Acts included a reference to subsections (1) to (4) of this section.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In any case where- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) apart from this section, section 98 would apply in relation to a payment of interest or of a royalty,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) at the time the payment is made, there is a special relationship (within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the Directive) between the company in Condition 1 of section 98 and the company in Condition 2 of that section or between one of those companies and another person, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) owing to the special relationship, the amount of the interest or royalty paid exceeds the amount ("the arm's length amount") which would have been paid in the absence of the relationship,</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The following provisions of the Taxes Act 1988 apply in relation to subsection (1) as if that subsection were a special relationship provision within the meaning of those provisions- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) in relation to the first receipt, the amount to be deducted under subsection (4)(b) above is an amount equal to the total of the chargeable amounts found in relation to the receipts.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Subsection (8) below applies if subsection (3) above prevents an allowable loss that accrued to a company otherwise than on a relevant disposal from being deductible from a chargeable gain accruing to the company on a relevant disposal.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That loss (to the extent that it has not been deducted from any other chargeable gain) shall instead be deductible from the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the company in the accounting period in which the receipt mentioned in subsection (1) above occurred.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) But if, in any case where subsection (3) above applies, there are one or more allowable losses- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>and their liability is joint and several.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) But where the liability arises by reason of the payment of a relevant lump sum death benefit it is a liability of the person to whom the lump sum death benefit is paid.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Subsection (4) applies if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The standard lifetime allowance for the tax year 2006-07 is &#163;1,500,000.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where one or more lifetime allowance enhancement factors operate in relation to a benefit crystallisation event occurring in relation to the individual, the individual's lifetime allowance at the time of the benefit crystallisation event is- 

<P align=center> SLA + (SLA &times; LAEF)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>A person is a corresponding partner in relation to a relevant owner if, immediately after the transaction- <UL>(a) he is a partner, and<BR>(b) he is the relevant owner or is connected with the relevant owner.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><I>Step One</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Identify the relevant owner or owners.</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>A person is a relevant owner if- <UL>(a) immediately after the transaction, he is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest, and<BR>(b) immediately before the transaction, he was a partner or connected with a partner.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Find the partner's actual partnership share on the relevant date.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>In a case falling within paragraph 21(2)(a), the relevant date- <UL>(a) if the partner was a partner on 19th October 2003, is that date;<BR>(b) if the partner became a partner after that date, is the date on which he became a partner.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>In a case falling within paragraph 21(2)(b), the relevant date- <UL>(a) if the partner was a partner on the effective date of the transfer of the relevant chargeable interest to the partnership, is that date;<BR>(b) if the partner became a partner after that date, is the date on which he became a partner.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step Two</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Add to that partnership share any increases in the partner's partnership share which- <UL>(a) occur in the period starting on the day after the relevant date and ending immediately before the transaction to which paragraph 18 applies, and<BR>(b) count for this purpose.</UL></TD></TR>
