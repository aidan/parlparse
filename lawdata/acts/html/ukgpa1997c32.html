<TR><TD valign=top><IMG SRC="/img/amdt-col.gif"></TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A prohibition order under this section is an order- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The saving or transitional provisions which may be included in a prohibition order shall be such as appear to the Commission to be just having regard to- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) After considering any representations made by the society, the Commission may make the prohibition order with such saving and transitional provisions (if any) as it thinks just; and where it does so, the Commission- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) shall issue the order by causing it to be served on the society; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The requirement of subsection (8) above, so far as it relates to directors, is satisfied by serving a copy on each director whose appointment has been officially notified and the non-receipt of a copy by a director or the chief executive does not affect the validity of the order.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Subject to subsection (11) below, a prohibition order shall remain in force until revoked by the Commission.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
