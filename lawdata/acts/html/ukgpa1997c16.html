<TD valign=top><UL>(b) in the case of the lease, the conditions in paragraph 3 below are or have been satisfied at some time in a period of account of the current lessor.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where the conditions in paragraph 3 below have been satisfied at some time in a period of account of the person who was at that time the lessor, they shall be taken to continue to be satisfied for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule unless and until- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The condition in this sub-paragraph is that, under the leasing arrangements, there is or may be payable to the lessor, or to a person connected with him, a sum (a "major lump sum") which is not rent but is a sum such as falls for accounting purposes to be treated in accordance with normal accountancy practice- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In determining the normal rent for a period of account for the purpose of determining whether the condition in sub-paragraph (4) above is satisfied, rent which falls to be brought into account for tax purposes as it falls due shall be treated- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) as accruing evenly throughout the period to which, in accordance with the terms of the lease, each payment falling due relates, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) as falling due as it so accrues,</UL></TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD><TD>unless any such payment falls due more than 12 months after the time at which any of the rent to which that payment relates is so treated as accruing.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) In this paragraph- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the lessee or a person connected with him may acquire, whether directly or indirectly, the leased asset, or an asset representing the leased asset, from the lessor or a person connected with the lessor; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) in connection with that acquisition, the lessor or a person connected with him may receive, whether directly or indirectly, a qualifying lump sum from the lessee or a person connected with the lessee.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In this paragraph, "qualifying lump sum" means any sum which is not rent but at least part of which would, if the recipient were a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, fall for accounting purposes to be treated in accordance with normal accountancy practice as a return on investment in respect of a finance lease or loan.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where a person is treated under sub-paragraph (1) above as if he had in a period of account been entitled to, and there had arisen to him, any rent from a lease of an asset, the rent shall be treated for tax purposes- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
