<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) However, where such a society purports to transfer or grant an interest in property, the fact that the act was not permitted by the society's registered rules or, as the case may be, that the committee in connection with the act exceeded any limitation on its powers under those rules, does not affect the title of a person who subsequently acquires the property or any interest in it for full consideration without actual notice of any such circumstances affecting the validity of the society's act.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In any proceedings arising out of subsection (1) of this section the burden of proving- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where a registered society is a charity with its registered office situated in England or Wales, the ratification of an act under section 7A(3) of this Act, or the ratification of a transaction to which section 7E of this Act applies, is ineffective without the prior written consent of the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The transaction is voidable at the instance of the society.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The transaction ceases to be voidable if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
