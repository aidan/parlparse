<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The general scheme of this Part of this Schedule is that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) entry of a company into tonnage tax does not of itself give rise to any balancing charges or balancing allowances,</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) a company subject to tonnage tax is not entitled to capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred for the purposes of its tonnage tax trade, whether before or after its entry into tonnage tax, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(c) on leaving tonnage tax a company is put broadly in the position it would have been in if it had never been subject to tonnage tax.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A company's tonnage tax trade is not a qualifying activity for the purposes of determining the company's entitlement to capital allowances.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="69"></a>69. - (1) On a company's entry into tonnage tax any unrelieved qualifying expenditure attributable to plant or machinery that is to be used wholly for the purposes of the company's tonnage tax trade is taken to a single pool (the company's "tonnage tax pool").<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the purposes of this paragraph "unrelieved qualifying expenditure" means the balance that would otherwise have been carried forward under Part II of the Capital Allowances Act 1990.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The amount of unrelieved qualifying expenditure attributable to plant or machinery in a class pool, or the main pool, is the proportion of the whole given by:
<!-- formula to check -->
<P align=center> AV /  PV where:

<P>AV is the aggregate market value of the assets concerned immediately before entry into tonnage tax, and

<P>PV is the aggregate market value at that time of all the assets in the pool.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
