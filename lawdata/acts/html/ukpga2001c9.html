<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that any aggregates levy for which that person is liable to account by reference to that period has become due, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If a balancing event occurs at the end of the chargeable period referred to in subsection (2), the amount written off under that subsection is to be taken into account in calculating the residue of qualifying expenditure immediately before the event to determine what balancing adjustment (if any) is to be made.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If on the termination a new lease is granted to the lessee as a result of the exercise of an option available to him under the terms of the first lease, the second lease is treated as a continuation of the first.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If on the termination the lessor pays a sum to the lessee in respect of a flat comprised in the lease, the lease is treated as if it had come to an end by surrender in consideration of the payment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
