<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>must before the end of the applicable period apply to the registrar to be registered (or alternatively, where he is not a person in a fiduciary position, to have any nominee registered) as the first proprietor of that estate.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In this section "the applicable period" means in the first instance the period of two months beginning with the date of the disposition, but- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the registrar may, if satisfied on the application of any interested person that there is good reason for doing so, make an order extending or further extending that period; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) If any disposition is subsequently effected by way of replacement for a disposition which has become void in accordance with subsection (5) above, the requirement of compulsory registration shall apply in relation to it under section 123 in the same way as it applied in relation to the void disposition, and the provisions of this section shall have effect accordingly.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Rules under this Act may make provision- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
