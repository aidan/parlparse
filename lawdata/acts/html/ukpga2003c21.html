<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that notification is to be one stating that that person is already providing the network or service, or making the facility available (rather than that it is his intention to do so).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) OFCOM may give effect, with or without modifications, to a proposal with respect to which they have published a notification under subsection (3) only if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) they have considered every representation about the proposal that is made to them within the period specified in the notification; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Where OFCOM have allocated telephone numbers for the purposes of any numbering conditions, they may withdraw that allocation if, and only if, the case is one in which the withdrawal of an allocation is authorised by this section.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The withdrawal of an allocation is authorised (subject to section 62) if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) consent to the withdrawal is given by the person to whom the numbers are for the time being allocated;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the withdrawal is made for the purposes of a numbering reorganisation applicable to a particular series of telephone numbers;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) the withdrawal is made in circumstances specified in the numbering conditions and for the purpose of securing that what appears to OFCOM to be the best and most efficient use is made of the numbers and other data that are appropriate for use as telephone numbers;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(e) the allocated numbers are numbers that have not been adopted during such period after their allocation as may be specified in the numbering conditions; or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(f) the allocated numbers are comprised in a series of numbers which have not to a significant extent been adopted or used during such period as may be so specified.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The withdrawal of an allocation is also authorised where- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) there have been serious and repeated contraventions, by the person to whom the allocation is for the time being allocated, of the numbering conditions; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The withdrawal of an allocation is also authorised where- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) it appears to OFCOM that contraventions by that person of numbering conditions makes the withdrawal of the allocation appropriate.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) OFCOM's power to set conditions specifying circumstances for the purposes of subsection (2)(d), and their power to withdraw an allocation in the specified circumstances, are each exercisable only in a manner that does not discriminate unduly- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) against particular communications providers;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) against particular users of the allocated numbers; or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) against a particular description of such providers or users;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>and the purposes for which those powers may be exercised do not include the carrying out of a numbering reorganisation of the sort mentioned in subsection (2)(c).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where OFCOM are proposing to withdraw an allocation in exercise of the power conferred by virtue of subsection (2)(e) or (f), they must- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) give a notification of their proposal;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) consider any representations made to them about the proposal within the period of one month following the day on which the notification is given; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) ensure that the withdrawal (if OFCOM decide to proceed with it after considering those representations) does not take effect until the end of the three months beginning with the end of the period mentioned in paragraph (b).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) A notification for the purposes of subsection (6) must be given in such manner as OFCOM consider appropriate for bringing it to the attention of- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the person to whom the numbers to which the proposed withdrawal relates are for the time being allocated;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) For the purposes of this section there are repeated contraventions by a person of numbering conditions to the extent that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in the case of a previous notification given to that person under section 94, OFCOM have determined for the purposes of section 95(2) or 96(2) that a contravention of a numbering condition did occur; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) in the period of twelve months following the day of the making of that determination, one or more further notifications have been given to that person in respect of contraventions of numbering conditions;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>and for the purposes of this subsection it shall be immaterial whether the notifications related to the same contravention or to different contraventions of the same or different conditions.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) In this section "numbering conditions" means- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies to the withdrawal of an allocation for the purposes of a numbering reorganisation that is applicable to a particular series of telephone numbers.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The allocation is to be withdrawn only if the reorganisation, so far as it relates to numbers of any description, is not such as to discriminate unduly- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) against particular communications providers;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) against a particular description of such providers or users.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The allocation must not be withdrawn if the reorganisation fails to provide for withdrawn allocations to be replaced by allocations of telephone numbers so nearly resembling the numbers to which the withdrawal relates as the purpose of the reorganisation allows.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where a replacement allocation is made for the purposes of the re-organisation- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) no payment is to be made to OFCOM in respect of the making of the replacement allocation; but</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) subsection (5) is to apply.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where this subsection applies- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) a provision for the making of periodic payments in respect of the withdrawn allocation is to be treated, to the extent that OFCOM determine that it should, as a provision requiring the making of periodic payments in respect of the replacement allocation; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) OFCOM may, if they think fit, make such repayments or adjustments of a provision for payment as appear to them to be appropriate in consequence of differences between- </UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It shall be the duty of OFCOM, in the carrying out of their functions under sections 56 to 62- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to secure that what appears to them to be the best use is made of the numbers that are appropriate for use as telephone numbers; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) to encourage efficiency and innovation for that purpose.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It shall also be the duty of OFCOM, in carrying out those functions, to secure that there is no undue discrimination by communications providers against other communications providers in relation to the adoption of telephone numbers for purposes connected with the use by one communications provider, or his customers, of an electronic communications network or electronic communications service provided by another.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In this section "number" has the same meaning as in section 56.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A general condition containing provision authorised by this section is not (subject to subsection (4)) to require a service to be broadcast or otherwise transmitted by means of an electronic communications network unless- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the service is included in the list of must-carry services; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the effect of the requirement is confined to networks by means of which public electronic communications services are provided that are used by a significant number of end-users as their principal means of receiving television programmes.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That list is as follows- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) General conditions making provision authorised by this section in relation to a listed service must, to such extent as OFCOM consider appropriate (and subject to subsection (5))- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) apply the requirement to broadcast or otherwise transmit that service to every service which is an ancillary service by reference to the listed service; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) provide for the listed service to be treated for the purposes of the conditions as constituting such other services comprised in or provided with that service as may be determined by OFCOM.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In making an order under subsection (5) the Secretary of State must have regard to- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the need to secure that the amount of capacity available in the case of every network for making other services available is reasonable and, accordingly, that the burden of complying with conditions set in accordance with this section is proportionate to the public benefit to be secured by that objective.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State from time to time to review- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) In determining whether it is appropriate for the purposes of subsection (9) to add a service to the list of must-carry services or to remove it, the Secretary of State must have regard, in particular, to- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the public benefit to be secured by the addition of the service to the list, or by its retention in the list;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the extent to which the service (if it were not included in the list) would nevertheless be made available to an acceptable technical standard by means of the networks to which conditions set in accordance with this section apply;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the capacity left available, after the requirements of those conditions have been complied with, for the broadcasting or other transmission of material by means of each of those networks; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) The Secretary of State may also, if (whether on such a review or in any other circumstances) he considers it appropriate to do so, by order make provision imposing requirements as to what, as between- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) An order under subsection (11) may provide for the terms to be determined by OFCOM in accordance with the provisions of the order.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where a notification under section 94 relates to more than one contravention, a separate penalty may be imposed in respect of each contravention.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where such a notification relates to a continuing contravention, no more than one penalty may be imposed in respect of the period of contravention specified in the notification.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The amount of a penalty imposed under section 96 is to be such amount not exceeding ten per cent. of the turnover of the notified provider's relevant business for the relevant period as OFCOM determine to be- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) appropriate; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) proportionate to the contravention in respect of which it is imposed.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In making that determination OFCOM must have regard to- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) any representations made to them by the notified provider;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of this section- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the turnover of a person's relevant business for a period shall be calculated in accordance with such rules as may be set out by order made by the Secretary of State; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) No order is to be made containing provision authorised by subsection (3) unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL><UL>(c) in the case of a person who at that time has ceased to carry on that business, the period of one year ending with the time when he ceased to carry it on.</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In the case of a contravention of an SMP apparatus condition the relevant business is so much of any business carried on by the person in respect of whose contravention the penalty is imposed as consists in the supply of electronic communications apparatus.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) So much of any business of a person on whom the penalty is imposed as falls within paragraph (f) of the definition of a relevant business shall be disregarded for the purposes of this section except in relation to- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A case is an urgent case for the purposes of this section if the contravention has resulted in, or creates an immediate risk of- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies where OFCOM, in exercise of their functions under the enactments relating to the management of the radio spectrum, have reserved frequencies for the broadcasting of television programmes.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It shall be the duty of OFCOM, in the carrying out of their functions under those enactments, to exercise their powers so as to secure, so far as practicable, that the requirement of subsection (3) is satisfied.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That requirement is that sufficient capacity is made available on the reserved frequencies for ensuring, in the case of every licensed television multiplex service, that the qualifying services are broadcast by means of that multiplex service.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In subsection (3) "licensed television multiplex service" means a television multiplex service the provision of which is authorised by a licence under Part 1 of the 1996 Act.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) that use does not require a wireless telegraphy licence but will involve the emission of electro-magnetic energy with a view to the reception of anything at places in the United Kingdom or in the territorial waters adjacent to the United Kingdom;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>and for the purposes of this section it is immaterial whether the emissions are from a place within the United Kingdom or from a place outside the United Kingdom.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On an application by that person, OFCOM may make a grant of recognised spectrum access in respect of any use by him of anything for wireless telegraphy that is specified in the grant.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A grant of recognised spectrum access made to a person shall set out, by reference to such factors as OFCOM think fit (including, so far as they think fit, frequencies, times and places of reception and strength and type of signal), the respects in which the use of anything by that person for wireless telegraphy is recognised by the grant.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A grant of recognised spectrum access to a person is made by giving him a notification containing the grant.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A grant of recognised spectrum access may be made subject to such restrictions and conditions as OFCOM think fit, including, in particular, restrictions or conditions as to strength or type of signal, as to times of use and as to the sharing of frequencies.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The restrictions and conditions of a grant of recognised spectrum access made to a person must not duplicate obligations already imposed on him by general conditions set under section 45.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Where a grant of recognised spectrum access is made subject to restrictions and conditions, the restrictions and conditions must be set out in the notification by which the grant is made.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Schedule 5 (which makes provision about the grant, revocation and modification of recognised spectrum access) shall have effect.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) OFCOM have decided under section 186(2) that it is appropriate for them to handle a dispute; or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) OFCOM must- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) consider the dispute; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) make a determination for resolving it.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The procedure for the consideration and determination of the dispute is to be the procedure that OFCOM consider appropriate.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In the case of a dispute referred back to OFCOM under section 186(6), that procedure may involve allowing the continuation of a procedure that has already been begun for resolving the dispute by alternative means.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Except in exceptional circumstances and subject to section 187(3), OFCOM must make their determination no more than four months after the following day- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where it is practicable for OFCOM to make their determination before the end of the four month period, they must make it as soon in that period as practicable.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The publication of information under this section must be in such manner as OFCOM consider appropriate for bringing it to the attention, to the extent that they consider appropriate, of members of the public.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="189"></a>189</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Disputes involving other member States</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies where it appears to OFCOM that a dispute referred or referred back to them under this Chapter relates partly to a matter falling within the jurisdiction of the regulatory authorities of another member State.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A dispute relates to matters falling within the jurisdiction of the regulatory authorities of another member State to the extent that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) it relates to the carrying on of activities by one or both of the parties to the dispute in more than one member State or to activities carried on by different parties to the dispute in different member States; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the activities to which the dispute relates, so far as they are carried on in another member State, are carried on in the member State for which those authorities are the regulatory authorities.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) the activities that are carried on in a member State include anything done by means of an electronic communications network, or part of such a network, which is situated in that member State.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Before taking any steps under this Chapter in relation to the reference or the dispute, OFCOM must consult the other regulatory authorities within whose jurisdiction the matter falls.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Accordingly, section 188 is to have effect in relation to the reference as if the period for making a determination which is specified in subsection (5) of that section were such period (if any) as may be agreed between- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Their main power (except in the case of a dispute relating to rights and obligations conferred or imposed by or under the enactments relating to the management of the radio spectrum) is to do one or more of the following- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) to give a direction imposing an obligation, enforceable by the parties to the dispute, to enter into a transaction between themselves on the terms and conditions fixed by OFCOM; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Their main power in the excepted case is just to make a declaration setting out the rights and obligations of the parties to the dispute.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Nothing in this section prevents OFCOM from exercising the following powers in consequence of their consideration under this Chapter of any dispute- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) their powers under Chapter 1 of this Part to set, modify or revoke general conditions, universal service conditions, access related conditions, privileged supplier conditions or SMP conditions;</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) OFCOM may, in making their determination, take account of decisions already made by others in the course of an attempt to resolve the dispute by alternative means; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the determination made by OFCOM may include provision ratifying decisions so made.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where OFCOM make a determination for resolving a dispute, they may require a party to the dispute- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to make payments to another party to the dispute in respect of costs and expenses incurred by that other party in consequence of the reference of the dispute to OFCOM, or in connection with it; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) to make payments to OFCOM in respect of costs and expenses incurred by them in dealing with the dispute.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) OFCOM are not, under subsection (6)(b), to require payments to be made to them by a party to the dispute except- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in a case where the dispute relates to the rights and obligations of the parties to the dispute under the enactments relating to the management of the radio spectrum; or</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) where it appears to OFCOM that the reference of the dispute by that party was frivolous or vexatious or that that party has otherwise abused the right of reference conferred by this Chapter.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) A determination made by OFCOM for resolving a dispute referred or referred back to them under this Chapter binds all the parties to the dispute.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>the amounts specified in subsection (5).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in respect of the first complete calendar year falling within the renewal period, the amount determined under subsection (1)(a);</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The service, if licensed to do so in accordance with section 219, may continue to include an analogue teletext service after it is no longer required under subsection (2)(b) to include such a service.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The analogue teletext service that must be or may be comprised in the public teletext service is a single additional television service that uses the combined spare capacity available for the provision of additional television services on the frequencies on which Channel 3 services, Channel 4 and S4C (or any of them) are broadcast in analogue form.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For so long as the public teletext service must consist of both a teletext service provided in digital form and an analogue teletext service, OFCOM must secure that both services are provided by the same person.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Those matters are- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that such adjustments as are appropriate are made as respects sums already paid in respect of any year or accounting period to which a modification under subsection (8) applies.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) Where OFCOM have granted a person's application under this section, the extensions and modifications take effect only if that person- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) has been notified by OFCOM of their proposals for modifications by virtue of subsection (6)(b) or (8)(b), and for the making of a determination under subsection (8)(a); and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In determining for the purposes of any condition under this section whether a change is a significant change- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) any change that is a significant change in relation to so much of the public teletext service as is provided in digital form or in relation to so much of it as is provided in analogue form is to be regarded as a significant change in relation to the whole service.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It shall be the duty of OFCOM- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies if OFCOM are of the opinion that the provider of a licensed public service channel or the public teletext provider- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) has failed to fulfil the public service remit for that channel or the public teletext service; or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This section does not apply unless- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) OFCOM are of the opinion that the failure of the provider is serious and is not excused by economic or market conditions; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) OFCOM determine that the situation requires the exercise of their powers under this section.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In making a determination under subsection (2)(b), OFCOM must have regard, in particular, to- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) OFCOM shall have power to give directions to the provider to do one or both of the following- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to revise the provider's latest statement of programme policy, or statement of service policy, in accordance with the directions; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A direction given under this section must set out- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) If OFCOM are satisfied- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) that the provider of a public service channel or the public teletext provider has failed to comply with a direction under this section,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that that provider is still failing to fulfil the public service remit for that channel or service or adequately to contribute to the fulfilment of the purposes of public service television broadcasting in the United Kingdom, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) that it would be both reasonable and proportionate to the seriousness of that failure to vary the provider's licence in accordance with this subsection,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>OFCOM may, by notice to the provider, vary that licence so as to replace self-regulation with detailed regulation.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) For the purposes of subsection (6) a variation replacing self-regulation with detailed regulation is a variation which- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) If, at any time following a variation in accordance with subsection (6) of a provider's licence, OFCOM consider that detailed regulation is no longer necessary, they may again vary the licence so as, with effect from such time as they may determine- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to provide for the conditions required by virtue of sections 265 to 269 again to be included in the regulatory regime for the service provided by that provider; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) to remove or modify some or all of the specific conditions inserted under that subsection.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Before giving a direction under this section to a provider or exercising their power under this section to vary a provider's licence, OFCOM must consult that provider.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) In accordance with section 265(5), the reference in subsection (1) to a failure to fulfil the public service remit for the public teletext service includes a failure to fulfil that remit as respects only one of the services comprised in that service.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Before including a recommendation for the making of an order under this section in a report under section 229 or 264, OFCOM must consult- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The three objectives apply only in relation to times when the channel or other service in its digital form is included in the list of must-carry services in section 64.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
