<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If a sum is registered in a magistrates' court as a result of this section, any enactment referring (in whatever terms) to a fine imposed, or other sum adjudged to be paid, on conviction by such a court applies as if the registered sum were a fine imposed by that court on the conviction of the defaulter on the date on which the sum was registered.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The court may adjourn the proceedings for a period of not more than 28 days for the purpose of allowing that claim to be investigated.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) On the resumption of proceedings that have been adjourned under subsection (3), the court must accept the defaulter's claim unless it is shown, on a balance of probabilities, that he was the recipient of the penalty notice.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The court may set aside a fine in the interests of justice.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) it would be inappropriate, if the property were returned, to take any action such as is mentioned in subsection (7) in relation to part A,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) it would (or would but for the facts mentioned in paragraph (a)) be appropriate, if the property were returned, to take such action in relation to part B, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) in all the circumstances, it is not reasonably practicable to separate part A from part B without prejudicing the use of part B for purposes for which it is lawful to use property seized under the power in question,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>the facts mentioned in paragraph (a) shall not be taken into account by the appropriate judicial authority in deciding whether the retention of the property is justified on grounds falling within subsection (7).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
