<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) But the employer and the employee may agree that subsection (1) is not to apply in relation to the shares (or interest in shares).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) An agreement under subsection (2) is irrevocable and- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In determining under section 428(3) (amount of charge) what would have been the market value of the shares (or interest in shares) at the time of the acquisition but for any restrictions (IUMV), that market value is to be calculated disregarding the effect on that market value of the intellectual property agreement and any transfer of intellectual property pursuant to it.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section has effect in relation to a tax year if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in the tax year income arises (or is treated as arising) to trustees from property held on qualifying trusts for the benefit of a vulnerable person ("qualifying trusts income"), and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Special income tax treatment applies for the tax year in accordance with sections 26 to 29.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) But this section does not have effect in relation to the tax year if the property from which the qualifying trusts income arises (or is treated as arising) is property in which a person who is a settlor (within the meaning given by section 660G(1) and (2) of ICTA) is regarded as having an interest for the purposes of section 660A of that Act (income arising under settlement where settlor retains an interest).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top>The trustees' liability to income tax for the tax year is to be reduced by an amount equal to- 

<P align=center> TQTI &minus; VQTI

<P>where- 

<UL>TQTI is an amount determined in accordance with section 27 (income tax liability of trustees in respect of qualifying trusts income), and

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of section 26, TQTI is the amount of income tax to which the trustees would (apart from this Chapter) be liable for the tax year in respect of the qualifying trusts income arising (or treated as arising) to them in that year (or to which they would be so liable if their liability were computed in accordance with subsection (2) in a case to which that subsection applies).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In a case where- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) income arising (or treated as arising) to the trustees in the tax year ("total income") includes income ("other income") which is not qualifying trusts income, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the trustees have any expenses in the tax year ("the management expenses") which are properly chargeable to total income or would be so chargeable but for any express provisions of the trusts,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>there shall be disregarded, in computing the income tax liability of the trustees for the tax year in respect of the qualifying trusts income arising (or treated as arising) to them in that year, such part of the management expenses as bears the same proportion to all those expenses as other income bears to total income.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) This section is subject to section 29 (vulnerable person election having effect for only part of tax year).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of section 26, VQTI is an amount equal to- 

<P align=center> TLV1 &minus; TLV2

<P>where- 

<UL>TLV2 is an amount determined in accordance with subsection (2) (and subsection (4) where it applies) (total tax liability of vulnerable person), and

<P>TLV1 is an amount determined in accordance with subsection (3) (and subsection (4) where it applies) (what total tax liability of vulnerable person would be if his income included qualifying trusts income).<BR>&nbsp;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) TLV2 is the total amount of income tax and capital gains tax to which the vulnerable person would be liable for the tax year if his income tax liability were computed in accordance with subsections (5) and (6).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) TLV1 is what TLV2 would be if the qualifying trusts income arising (or treated as arising) to the trustees in the tax year in respect of which the trustees are liable to income tax were income of the vulnerable person for the tax year.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where the vulnerable person is non-UK resident during the tax year- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) his income tax liability for the purposes of determining TLV1 and TLV2 is to be computed in accordance with the Income Tax Acts on the assumption that he is resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom throughout the tax year, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) his capital gains tax liability for the purposes of determining TLV1 and TLV2 is to be computed on the assumption that his taxable amount for the purposes of section 3 of TCGA 1992 is equal to his deemed CGT taxable amount.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of this section, in a case where income which has arisen to the trustees (whenever it arose) is distributed to the vulnerable person in the tax year, that income is to be disregarded in computing income tax to which he would be liable for the tax year for the purposes of determining TLV1 and TLV2.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the purposes of this section, in computing income tax to which the vulnerable person would be liable for the tax year for the purposes of determining TLV1 and TLV2, there is to be disregarded any relief which is given by way of a reduction in the amount of income tax to which the vulnerable person would be liable apart from that relief.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) For the purposes of this section- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) whether or not a vulnerable person is non-UK resident is to be determined in accordance with section 41(2), and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) a non-UK resident vulnerable person's deemed CGT taxable amount is to be determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of Schedule 1.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) This section is subject to section 29 (vulnerable person election having effect for only part of tax year).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Those modifications are- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) that references to the qualifying trusts income arising (or treated as arising) to the trustees in the tax year are to be treated as references to the qualifying trusts income arising (or treated as arising) to them in the elected part of the tax year, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that the references in section 27(2) to income arising (or treated as arising) to the trustees in the tax year and expenses of the trustees in the tax year are to be treated as (respectively) references to income arising (or treated as arising) to the trustees in the elected part of the tax year and expenses of the trustees in that part of the tax year.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section has effect in relation to a tax year if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in the tax year chargeable gains accrue to the trustees of a settlement from the disposal of settled property which is held on qualifying trusts for the benefit of a vulnerable person ("the qualifying trusts gains"),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the trustees would (apart from this Chapter) be chargeable to capital gains tax in respect of those gains,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the trustees are either resident in the United Kingdom during any part of the tax year or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom during the tax year, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) a claim for special tax treatment under this Chapter for the tax year is made by the trustees.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Special capital gains tax treatment applies for the tax year in accordance with- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) section 31 (vulnerable person UK resident during the tax year), or</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) section 32 (vulnerable person non-UK resident during the tax year).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) But this section does not have effect in relation to the tax year if the vulnerable person dies during that year.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The reference in subsection (1)(a) to chargeable gains accruing to the trustees from the disposal of settled property includes a reference to chargeable gains treated as accruing to them under section 13 of TCGA 1992 (attribution of gains to members of non-resident companies).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of this section and sections 31 and 32 whether a vulnerable person is UK resident or non-UK resident during a tax year is to be determined in accordance with section 41(2).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Section 77(1) (and section 78 and section 79, apart from subsection (6)) of TCGA 1992 are to be treated as applying in relation to the qualifying trusts gains as if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
