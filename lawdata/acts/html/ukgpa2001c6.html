<TD valign=top><UL>(b) by any subordinate legislation made not more than two years before that day,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD valign=top><UL>(c) such incidental, consequential, transitional or supplemental provision as the Minister thinks appropriate.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In this Act- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) any reference to creating or imposing a burden includes a reference to authorising or requiring a burden to be created or imposed,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) any reference to removing a burden includes a reference to removing the authorisation or requirement by virtue of which a burden may be imposed, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) remove any necessary protection, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) prevent any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom which he might reasonably expect to continue to exercise.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If an order under section 1 creates a new criminal offence, then, subject to subsection (4), that offence shall not be punishable- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) For the purposes of section 5(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 (c. 36), provision falling within subsection (7)(b) is to be treated as provision made by an Act.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
