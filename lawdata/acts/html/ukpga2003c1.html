<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The amount of the deemed employment payment for a tax year ("the year") is the amount resulting from the following steps- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 1</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Find (applying section 55) the total amount of all payments and benefits received by the intermediary in the year in respect of the relevant engagements, and reduce that amount by 5&#37;.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 2</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Add (applying that section) the amount of any payments and benefits received by the worker in the year in respect of the relevant engagements, otherwise than from the intermediary, that- </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) are not chargeable to income tax as employment income, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) would be so chargeable if the worker were employed by the client.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 3</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Deduct (applying Chapters 1 to 5 of Part 5) the amount of any expenses met in the year by the intermediary that would have been deductible from the taxable earnings from the employment if- </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the worker had been employed by the client, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the expenses had been met by the worker out of those earnings.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>If the result at this or any later point is nil or a negative amount, there is no deemed employment payment.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 4</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Deduct the amount of any capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred by the intermediary that could have been deducted from employment income under section 262 of CAA 2001 (employments and offices) if the worker had been employed by the client and had incurred the expenditure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 5</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Deduct any contributions made in the year for the benefit of the worker by the intermediary to a scheme approved under Chapter 1 or 4 of Part 14 of ICTA that if made by an employer for the benefit of an employee would not be chargeable to income tax as income of the employee.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>This does not apply to excess contributions made and later repaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 6</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Deduct the amount of any employer's national insurance contributions paid by the intermediary for the year in respect of the worker.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 7</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Deduct the amount of any payments and benefits received in the year by the worker from the intermediary- </TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in respect of which the worker is chargeable to income tax as employment income, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) which do not represent items in respect of which a deduction was made under step 3.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 8</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Assume that the result of step 7 represents an amount together with employer's national insurance contributions on it, and deduct what (on that assumption) would be the amount of those contributions.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>The result is the deemed employment payment.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If section 559 of ICTA applies (sub-contractors in the construction industry: payments to be made under deduction), the intermediary is treated for the purposes of step 1 of subsection (1) as receiving the amount that would have been received had no deduction been made under that section.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In step 3 of subsection (1), the reference to expenses met by the intermediary includes- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) expenses met by the worker and reimbursed by the intermediary, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) where the intermediary is a partnership and the worker is a member of the partnership, expenses met by the worker for and on behalf of the partnership.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In step 3 of subsection (1), the expenses deductible include the amount of any mileage allowance relief for the year which the worker would have been entitled to in respect of the use of a vehicle falling within subsection (5) if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the worker had been employed by the client, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the vehicle had not been a company vehicle (within the meaning of Chapter 2 of Part 4).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A vehicle falls within this subsection if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) it is provided by the intermediary for the worker, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) where the intermediary is a partnership and the worker is a member of the partnership, it is provided by the worker for the purposes of the business of the partnership.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where, on the assumptions mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) of step 3 of subsection (1), the deductibility of the expenses is determined under sections 337 to 342 (travel expenses), the duties performed under the relevant engagements are treated as duties of a continuous employment with the intermediary.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In step 7 of subsection (1), the amounts deductible include any payments received in the year from the intermediary that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) are exempt from income tax by virtue of section 229 or 233 (mileage allowance payments and passenger payments), and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) do not represent items in respect of which a deduction was made under step 3.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) For the purposes of subsection (1) any necessary apportionment is to be made on a just and reasonable basis of amounts received by the intermediary that are referable- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to the services of more than one worker, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A "payment or benefit" means anything that, if received by an employee for performing the duties of an employment, would be earnings from the employment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The cash equivalent of the benefit of a car for a tax year is calculated as follows- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 1</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Find the price of the car in accordance with sections 122 to 124.</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><I>Step 4</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>If the amount carried forward from step 3 exceeds &#163;80,000, the interim sum is &#163;80,000.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>In any other case, the interim sum is the amount carried forward from step 3.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Make any deduction under section 143 for any periods when the car was unavailable.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Make any deduction from the provisional sum under section 144 in respect of payments by the employee for the private use of the car.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>The result is the cash equivalent of the benefit of the car for the year.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The method of calculation set out in subsection (1) is modified in the special cases dealt with in- 

<P>section 146 (cars that run on road fuel gas), and

<P>section 147 (classic cars: 15 years of age or more).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>is to be treated for the purposes of this Chapter as if the interest or shares mentioned in paragraph (c)(ii) were also acquired as a director or employee of the company.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Nothing in subsection (3) or (4) affects the rights or opportunities included by virtue of subsection (2)(b).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In this section "convertible shares" has the same meaning as in Chapter 3 of this Part (convertible shares) (see section 435(2) and the definition of shares in section 446(1)).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="424"></a>424</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Meaning of interest being "only conditional"</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Chapter an interest in shares is "only conditional" for so long as the terms on which the person is entitled to it- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) provide that if certain circumstances arise, or do not arise, there will be a transfer, reversion or forfeiture as a result of which that person will cease to be entitled to any beneficial interest in the shares, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) are not such that, on the transfer, reversion or forfeiture, that person will be entitled to receive in respect of the interest an amount that is equal to or more than its market value at that time.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) But a person is not to be regarded as having an interest in shares which is only conditional by reason only that one or more of the following is the case- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b) the market value of the interest is to be determined as if there were no provision for transfer, reversion or forfeiture.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In subsection (2)(b) "articles of association" includes, in the case of a company incorporated under the law of a country outside the United Kingdom, any equivalent document relating to the company.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The references in subsection (2)(b) and (c) to a person ceasing to hold a relevant office or employment are to that person ceasing to be an officer or employee of the company in question, or of one or more group companies or of any group company.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) For the purposes of subsection (6)- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) a company is a "group company" in relation to another company if they are members of the same group, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) companies are taken to be members of the same group if, and only if, one is a 51&#37; subsidiary of the other or both are 51&#37; subsidiaries of a third company.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The taxable amount determined under section 428 counts as employment income of the employee for the relevant tax year.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The condition relating to a directors' certificate is that the directors of the principal company of the group give to the Inland Revenue, not later than 2 years after the end of the period of account, a certificate that in their opinion the conditions in subsections (2) and (3) are satisfied in relation to that period.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Chapter applies to a share option granted by reason of a person's office or employment as a director or employee of a company.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The person may be a director or employee of the company whose shares are the subject of the share option, or of another company.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The share option may be granted to the director or employee or to another person.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In this Chapter, a "share option" means a right to acquire shares in a company and (unless the context indicates a different meaning)- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>"the employee", in relation to a share option, means the person mentioned in subsection (1); and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>"the share option" means the right to acquire shares mentioned there;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>and "director" and "employee" have the extended meaning given by section 487(1).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="472"></a>472</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Introduction to taxation of share options</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The starting-point is that liability to tax may arise by virtue of Chapter 1 of Part 3 (earnings) or Chapter 10 of that Part (taxable benefits: residual liability to charge) when the share option is received, but not when it is exercised.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) But section 474 (no charge in respect of receipt of shorter-term option) contains an exemption from this liability.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Liability to tax may arise when the share option is exercised by virtue of- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) Chapter 8 of Part 3 (taxable benefits: notional loans in respect of acquisitions of shares), or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) section 476 or 477 (charge on exercise etc. of option).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Liability to tax may also arise when the share option is assigned or released by virtue of section 476 or 477.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) There are special rules relating to share options received under- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) approved SAYE option schemes (see Chapter 7 of this Part),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) approved CSOP schemes (see Chapter 8 of this Part), or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) enterprise management incentives (see Chapter 9 of this Part).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Chapter (apart from sections 472 and 485) does not apply to a share option granted by reason of a person's office or employment if the earnings from the office or employment were not (or would not have been if there had been any) general earnings to which section 15 or 21 applies (earnings for year when employee resident and ordinarily resident in the UK).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This Chapter (apart from sections 472 and 485) does not apply to a share option so granted after the person has ceased to hold the office or employment, if it would not apply in the event of the option being granted in the last tax year in which the office or employment was held.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Subsection (2) applies if the share option cannot be exercised after the tenth anniversary of the date on which it was obtained.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No liability to income tax arises in respect of the receipt of the share option, except as provided by section 526 (approved CSOP scheme: charge where option granted at a discount).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies if the share option can be exercised after the tenth anniversary of the date on which it was obtained.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the purposes of any liability to tax by virtue of Chapter 1 of Part 3 (earnings) in respect of the receipt of the share option, the value of the option is taken to be- 

<P align=center> MV &minus; C

<P>where- 

<P>MV is the higher of- 

<P>(a) the market value at the time the share option is obtained of the shares that are the subject of the share option, and

<P>(b) the market value at that time of any shares for which those shares may be exchanged, and

<P>C is- 

<P>(a) the amount or value of the consideration for which the shares that are the subject of the share option may be acquired, or

<P>(b) if that consideration is variable, the least amount or value of the consideration for which they may be acquired.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In this section "market value" has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of TCGA 1992 by virtue of Part 8 of that Act.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The "relevant tax year" is the tax year in which the option is exercised, assigned or released.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Subsection (2) is subject to-

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies if a person other than the employee realises a gain by exercising, assigning or releasing the share option and any of the following is the case- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the option was granted to that other person, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the employee and the other person are connected persons at the time when the gain is realised.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The "relevant tax year" is the tax year in which the option is exercised, assigned or released.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) This section does not apply by virtue of subsection (1)(b) or (c) if the employee was divested of the share option by operation of law.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In that case the person who realises the gain is chargeable to tax under Case VI of Schedule D on an amount equal to the amount of the gain in a case within subsection (1)(b) or (c) (see section 479 or 480).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The taxable amount for the purposes of sections 476 and 477 (charges on exercise, assignment or release of option) is- 

<P align=center> AG &minus; DA

<P>where- 

<P>AG is the amount of the gain (see section 479 or 480), and

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For this purpose there is no disposal of the participant's beneficial interest if and at the time when- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
