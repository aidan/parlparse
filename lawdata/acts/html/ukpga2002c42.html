<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to allow an inspector to take a sample from it, for the purpose of establishing its genotype;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies where it appears to the Secretary of State that a sheep is of a genotype specified in an order under section 36A.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Secretary of State must consider whether there are exceptional circumstances that justify allowing the sheep to be used for breeding.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If it appears to the Secretary of State that allowing the sheep to be used for breeding would not be justified, he must give notice to its keeper ("a restriction notice") that the restrictions and requirements imposed by subsections (7) to (9) apply in relation to the sheep.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A restriction notice- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) may be made so as to apply to more than one sheep, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) may describe the sheep to which it applies in such a way as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If the keeper of a sheep is not the same person as its owner, the Secretary of State may give a separate restriction notice to the owner.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Subsections (7) to (9) apply to a person to whom a restriction notice is given.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) He must not- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) use a sheep to which the notice applies, or its semen, eggs or embryos, for purposes of or connected with breeding, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) cause or permit such a sheep or such semen, eggs or embryos to be used by another person for those purposes.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) He must arrange for any semen, egg or embryo which has at any time been taken from a sheep to which the notice applies, and which is in his possession or under his control, to be destroyed.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) He must arrange for each sheep to which the notice applies- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to be castrated or (as appropriate) sterilised before the end of the period of one month beginning with the date on which the notice was given, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) to be slaughtered before the end of the period of seven months beginning with that date.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) For the purposes of subsection (2) exceptional circumstances include circumstances in which the imposition in relation to the sheep of the restrictions and requirements of subsections (7) to (9) is likely to cause the extinction of the breed of which the sheep is a member.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="36D"></a>36D</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Appeals</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A person to whom a restriction notice has been given may appeal against the notice to a person appointed by the Secretary of State for the purpose of dealing with appeals under this Part ("an assessor").<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) An appeal may not be brought after the end of the period of 21 days beginning with the date on which the notice concerned was given to the appellant.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) But the Secretary of State may, in a particular case, extend the period of 21 days if he considers that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the extension.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If the restriction notice applies to more than one sheep, the appeal may be limited to the sheep specified by the appellant.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If the assessor allows the appeal, in whole or in part, he may- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) revoke the notice,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) revoke the notice so far as it applies to one or more sheep specified by him, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) direct that a further test is carried out in relation to sheep specified by him.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) A direction under subsection (5)(c) may require- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) a further sample to be taken,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the further test to be carried out by a different testing laboratory.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The Secretary of State may make regulations supplementing the provisions of this section.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The regulations may, in particular, make provision- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) as to the procedure to be followed on an appeal,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) extending the period mentioned in section 36C(9)(a) where an appeal is brought against a restriction notice,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) requiring the appellant to meet the reasonable costs of, and in connection with, the taking of a further sample or the carrying out of a further test as a result of a direction under subsection (5)(c), and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) as to the recovery of any such costs.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The revocation of a restriction notice (in whole or in part) by an assessor does not prevent the issue of another restriction notice, following the testing of a further sample.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="36E"></a>36E</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Secretary of State's powers of enforcement</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies if the Secretary of State is satisfied that a person to whom a restriction notice has been given has failed to comply with one or more of the restrictions or requirements imposed on him by section 36C.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) But it does not apply in relation to any sheep- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) which is the subject of an appeal under section 36D which has not been disposed of, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) which, as the result of a successful appeal, is no longer subject to the restriction notice.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Secretary of State may take such reasonable steps as he considers appropriate to secure that the failure is remedied.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In particular, the Secretary of State may cause to be castrated (or as appropriate sterilised) or slaughtered any sheep- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) which is the subject of the notice, but</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) which has neither been castrated (or as appropriate sterilised) nor slaughtered within the period mentioned in section 36C(9)(b).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The Secretary of State may make regulations supplementing the provisions of this section.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A person to whom a restriction notice is given commits an offence (whether or not the notice is the subject of an appeal) if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) he sells (or otherwise transfers to another person) a sheep to which the notice applies, or any of its semen, eggs or embryos;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) he fails, without reasonable excuse (proof of which lies on him) to comply with any of the restrictions or requirements imposed by subsections (7) to (9) of section 36C.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any other person commits an offence if he uses any semen, egg or embryo which he knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, has been taken from a sheep which is the subject of a restriction notice.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A person commits an offence if, without reasonable excuse (proof of which lies on him), he fails to comply with any provision of regulations made under section 36B.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A person commits an offence if he obstructs an inspector or any other person discharging, or attempting to discharge, functions conferred by or under this Part.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) ascertaining whether any such function should be exercised.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If a justice of the peace is satisfied on sworn information in writing that the first condition is satisfied and that the second or third condition is satisfied he may issue a warrant authorising a person mentioned in section 36G(1) to enter premises, if necessary using reasonable force, for the purpose there mentioned.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The information must include- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The first condition is that there are reasonable grounds for a person mentioned in section 36G(1) to enter premises for the purpose there mentioned.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
