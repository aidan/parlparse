<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) In subsection (7), "specified" means specified in the notice.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><FONT size=2>Compulsory modifications of pipelines.</FONT></TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that the pipeline can and should be modified by installing in it a junction through which another pipeline may be connected to the pipeline,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>then, subject to section 17(8), the Secretary of State may, after giving the owner of the pipeline an opportunity of being heard about the matter, serve on the owner and the applicant a notice in accordance with subsection (2).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) For the purposes of section 14(1) a notice under subsection (1) of this section requiring a person to carry out modifications authorises him to carry out the modifications; but nothing in Schedule 2 shall apply to such a notice.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><FONT size=2>Acquisition of rights to use pipelines.</FONT></TD>
<TD valign=top><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="17"></a>17.</B> - (1) Subsections (2) and (3) apply where a person applies to the Secretary of State for a notice under this section securing to the applicant a right to have conveyed, by a controlled pipeline of which he is not the owner, quantities specified in the application of things which are of a kind so specified and which the pipeline is designed to convey.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) after the expiry of 21 days beginning with the date on which notice under paragraph (a) was served, but before considering the application, give them an opportunity of being heard with respect to the application.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that, if he served a notice under this section the pipeline in question could be operated in accordance with the notice without prejudicing its efficient operation for the purpose of conveying, on behalf of its owner, the quantities of permitted substances which the owner requires or may reasonably be expected to require, the Secretary of State may serve such a notice on the owner and the applicant.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In subsection (3), "permitted substances" means the things which may be conveyed by the pipeline in accordance with an authorisation (or, if no authorisation for the use of the pipeline is required by section 14(1), means the things which the pipeline is designed to convey).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A notice under this section may contain such provisions as the Secretary of State considers appropriate for any of the following purposes- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to secure to the applicant, without prejudicing the efficient operation of the pipeline for the purpose mentioned in subsection (3), the right to have conveyed by the pipeline the quantities specified in the application of the things so specified;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) to secure to the applicant the right to have a pipeline of his connected to the pipeline by the applicant or owner.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Such a notice may also authorise the owner to recover from the applicant payments by way of consideration for any right mentioned in subsection (5)(a) or (d) of amounts specified in the notice or determined in accordance with the notice.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Before serving a notice under section 15(6) on a person other than the holder of the relevant authorisation, the Secretary of State shall give that person an opportunity to make an application under subsection (1) in respect of the proposed pipeline to which the authorisation relates; and subsections (1) to (6) shall have effect for this purpose as if references to a pipeline and the owner of it were references to the proposed pipeline and the proposed owner of it.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Before serving a notice under section 16(1) on a person other than the owner of the relevant pipeline, the Secretary of State shall give that person particulars of the modifications which he proposes to specify in the notice and an opportunity to make an application under subsection (1) in respect of the pipeline; and subsections (1) to (6) shall have effect for this purpose as if references to a pipeline were references to the pipeline as it would be with those modifications.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The use of a pipeline by any person in accordance with a right secured to him by virtue of this section is not a contravention of section 14(1); but a person to whom a right is so secured may not assign the right to any other person.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Subject to subsections (7) and (8), if the Secretary of State considers that the holder of an authorisation- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) has contravened any provision of a notice which, under section 16 or 17, was served on him in his capacity as the owner of the pipeline (or the proposed owner of the proposed pipeline) to which the authorisation relates,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>the Secretary of State may serve on the holder a notice stating that the authorisation is to cease to be in force at a time specified in the notice.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
