<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies whenever a court or adoption agency is coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The paramount consideration of the court or adoption agency must be the child's welfare, throughout his life.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The court or adoption agency must at all times bear in mind that, in general, any delay in coming to the decision is likely to prejudice the child's welfare.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The court or adoption agency must have regard to the following matters (among others)- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the child's ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision (considered in the light of the child's age and understanding),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the child's particular needs,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) the child's age, sex, background and any of the child's characteristics which the court or agency considers relevant,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(e) any harm (within the meaning of the Children Act 1989 (c. 41)) which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(f) the relationship which the child has with relatives, and with any other person in relation to whom the court or agency considers the relationship to be relevant, including- </UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The court or adoption agency must always consider the whole range of powers available to it in the child's case (whether under this Act or the Children Act 1989); and the court must not make any order under this Act unless it considers that making the order would be better for the child than not doing so.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In this section, "coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child", in relation to a court, includes- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) coming to a decision in any proceedings where the orders that might be made by the court include an adoption order (or the revocation of such an order), a placement order (or the revocation of such an order) or an order under section 26 (or the revocation or variation of such an order),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) coming to a decision about granting leave in respect of any action (other than the initiation of proceedings in any court) which may be taken by an adoption agency or individual under this Act,</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In the case of a person adopted by one of the person's natural parents as sole adoptive parent, subsection (3)(b) has no effect as respects entitlement to property depending on relationship to that parent, or as respects anything else depending on that relationship.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A relationship existing by virtue of section 67 may be referred to as an adoptive relationship, and- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A reference (however expressed) to the adoptive mother and father of a child adopted by- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="69"></a>69</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Rules of interpretation for instruments concerning property</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The rules of interpretation contained in this section apply (subject to any contrary indication and to Schedule 4) to any instrument so far as it contains a disposition of property.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In applying section 67(1) and (2) to a disposition which depends on the date of birth of a child or children of the adoptive parent or parents, the disposition is to be interpreted as if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) two or more people adopted on the same date had been born on that date in the order of their actual births;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>but this does not affect any reference to a person's age.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Examples of phrases in wills on which subsection (2) can operate are- 

<P><UL>1. Children of A "living at my death or born afterwards".

<P>2. Children of A "living at my death or born afterwards before any one of such children for the time being in existence attains a vested interest and who attain the age of 21 years".

<P>3. As in example 1 or 2, but referring to grandchildren of A instead of children of A.

<P>4. A for life "until he has a child", and then to his child or children.

<P><I>Note</I>. Subsection (2) will not affect the reference to the age of 21 years in example 2.<BR>&nbsp;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Section 67(3) does not prejudice- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) any qualifying interest, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) any interest expectant (whether immediately or not) upon a qualifying interest.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>"Qualifying interest" means an interest vested in possession in the adopted person before the adoption.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where it is necessary to determine for the purposes of a disposition of property effected by an instrument whether a woman can have a child- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) it must be presumed that once a woman has attained the age of 55 years she will not adopt a person after execution of the instrument, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) if she does so, then (in spite of section 67) that person is not to be treated as her child or (if she does so as one of a couple) as the child of the other one of the couple for the purposes of the instrument.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In this section, "instrument" includes a private Act settling property, but not any other enactment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="70"></a>70</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Dispositions depending on date of birth</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Where a disposition depends on the date of birth of a person who was born illegitimate and who is adopted by one of the natural parents as sole adoptive parent, section 69(2) does not affect entitlement by virtue of Part 3 of the Family Law Reform Act 1987 (c. 42) (dispositions of property).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subsection (1) applies for example where- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) a testator dies in 2001 bequeathing a legacy to his eldest grandchild living at a specified time,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) An adoption does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of honour.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) An adoption does not affect the devolution of any property limited (expressly or not) to devolve (as nearly as the law permits) along with any peerage or dignity or title of honour.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Subsection (2) applies only if and so far as a contrary intention is not expressed in the instrument, and has effect subject to the terms of the instrument.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A trustee or personal representative is not liable to any person by reason of a conveyance or distribution of the property made without regard to any such fact if he has not received notice of the fact before the conveyance or distribution.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) This section does not prejudice the right of a person to follow the property, or any property representing it, into the hands of another person, other than a purchaser, who has received it.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
