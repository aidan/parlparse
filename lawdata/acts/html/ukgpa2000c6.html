<TD valign=top><UL><UL>(ii) he wishes the panel to refer him back to the appropriate court with a view to the referral order (or orders) being revoked on account of a significant change in his circumstances (such as his being taken to live abroad) making compliance with any youth offender contract impractical; or</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the panel may decide to end the meeting and refer the offender back to that court.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) review the extent of the offender's compliance to date with the terms of the contract; and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) decide, in the light of that review, whether his compliance with those terms has been such as to justify the conclusion that, by the time the compliance period expires, he will have satisfactorily completed the contract;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>and the panel shall give the offender written confirmation of its decision.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the panel decides that the offender's compliance with the terms of the contract has been such as to justify that conclusion, the panel's decision shall have the effect of discharging the referral order (or orders) as from the end of the compliance period.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Otherwise the panel shall refer the offender back to the appropriate court.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Nothing in section 22(2) above prevents the panel from making the decision mentioned in subsection (3) above in the offender's absence if it appears to the panel to be appropriate to do that instead of exercising either of its powers under section 22(2).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
