<TD valign=top>This subsection does not prejudice the generality of subsection (1).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) This section does not prejudice any right of an employee to terminate his contract of employment if a substantial change is made to his detriment in his working conditions.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>But no such right arises by reason only that, by virtue of this section, the identity of his employer changes unless the employee shows that, in all the circumstances, the change is a significant change and is to his detriment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The officer's period of employment with the committee counts as a period of employment in his Crown employment and the appointment does not break the continuity of that employment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The appropriate Minister may by order make a scheme for the transfer to the other person (the "transferee") of any person (an "eligible employee") employed under a contract of employment with the transferor on work which would have continued but for the implementation or termination of the arrangements.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A scheme may apply- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A scheme may be made only if any directions about consultation given by the appropriate Minister have been complied with in relation to each of the eligible employees to be transferred in pursuance of the scheme.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Section 21 (except subsection (5) and the definitions of "scheme" and "transferee") applies to a scheme made by virtue of this section as it applies to a scheme made by virtue of section 20, and as if "old employer" and "transferee" had the same meanings as in this section.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
