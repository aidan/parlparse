<TR><TD valign=top>INSTRUCTIONS TO THE VOTER<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. You must sign this declaration of identity in the presence of a person known to you. <I>You are required to do this even if you have already signed a similar declaration of identity in respect of another election to be held on the same day.</I> That person should then sign this declaration as a witness, adding his or her name and address. Without this the declaration will be invalid.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. You should place the figure 1 opposite the name of the candidate for whom you wish to vote and in addition you may, if you wish, place the figure 2 opposite the name of the candidate of your second choice, the figure 3 opposite the name of the candidate of your third choice and so on in the order of your preference. You may indicate by figures as many or as few preferences as you wish.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The figure or figures should be placed in the spaces provided at the left-hand side of the paper opposite the name of the candidate for whom you intend it. Do this secretly. If you cannot vote without assistance, the person assisting you must not disclose how you have voted.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In no circumstances write anything else on the paper; if you do your vote may be invalid.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Different colours are used for the ballot papers for each election. Each ballot paper has its own ballot paper envelope (the smaller envelope marked "A"), declaration of identity and covering envelope (the larger envelope marked "B"). The covering envelope and declaration of identity for a particular ballot paper are those which refer to the colour of that ballot paper. It is important that you use the correct envelopes and declaration of identity, otherwise your vote may not be counted. You may find it helpful to sort the documents into separate sets, each consisting of a ballot paper, ballot paper envelope, declaration of identity and covering envelope. Then proceed as follows- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><UL>(a) place each ballot paper in the correct smaller envelope and seal it;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><UL>(b) put that envelope, together with the correct declaration of identity, in the correct covering envelope and seal it;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><UL>(c) return the covering envelopes without delay. Ballot papers must be received by the returning officer not later than the close of poll.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If you receive more than one ballot paper, remember that it is illegal to vote more than once (otherwise than as proxy) at the <I>same election</I>. You are entitled to vote at different elections which are held on the same day.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. At this election you cannot vote in person at a polling station, even if you receive an official poll card.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. If you inadvertently spoil your ballot paper, you can apply to the returning officer for another one. With your application you must return, in your own envelope, the spoilt ballot paper, the declaration of identity and the envelopes marked "A" and "B". Remember that there is little time available if a fresh postal ballot paper is to be issued and counted."<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
