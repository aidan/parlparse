<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) subsection (8) of section 2 applies but he has not applied for a certificate as required by that subsection; or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) he has not made payment, in full, of any amount due under section 1(2) by the end of the period allowed under section 4.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Secretary of State may- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in a case within subsection (1)(a), issue the person who made the compensation payment with a certificate, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) in a case within subsection (1)(b), issue him with a copy of the certificate or (if more than one has been issued) the most recent one,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>and, in either case, issue him with a demand that payment of any amount due under section 1(2) be made immediately.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Secretary of State may recover the amount for which a demand for payment is made under subsection (2) from the person who made the compensation payment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If the person who made the compensation payment resides or carries on business in Scotland, the demand may be enforced as if it were an extract registered decree arbitral bearing a warrant for execution issued by the sheriff court of any sheriffdom in Scotland.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) A document which states that it is a record of the amount recoverable under subsection (3) is conclusive evidence that that amount is so recoverable if it is signed by a person authorised to do so by the Secretary of State.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) For the purposes of subsection (6), a document purporting to be signed by a person authorised to do so by the Secretary of State is to be treated as so signed unless the contrary is proved.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
