<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Act imposes charges to income tax under- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) Part 5 (certain miscellaneous income).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Those charges to tax have effect for the purposes of section 1(1) of ICTA (the general charge to income tax).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Exemptions from those charges are dealt with in Part 6 (exempt income) but any Part 6 exemptions which are most obviously relevant to particular types of income are also mentioned in the provisions about those types of income.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What is or is not mentioned in those provisions does not limit the effect of Part 6.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) This Act also contains- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) provision about rent-a-room relief and foster-care relief (see Part 7),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) special rules for foreign income (see Part 8),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) special rules for partnerships (see Part 9), and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) certain calculation rules and general provisions (see Part 10).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For abbreviations and defined expressions used in this Act, see section 885 and Schedule 4.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Act contains some rules establishing an order of priority in respect of certain amounts which would otherwise- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) fall within a charge to income tax under two or more Chapters or Parts of this Act, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) fall within a charge to income tax under a Chapter or Part of this Act and ITEPA 2003.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) See, in particular- 

<UL>section 4 (provisions which must be given priority over Part 2),

<P>section 261 (provisions which must be given priority over Part 3),

<P>section 262 (priority between Chapters within Part 3),

<P>section 366 (provisions which must be given priority over Part 4),

<P>section 367 (priority between Chapters within Part 4),

<P>section 575 (provisions which must be given priority over Part 5), and

<P>section 576 (priority between Chapters within Part 5).</UL>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) But the rules in those sections need to be read with other rules of law (whether in this Act or otherwise) about the scope of particular provisions or the order of priority to be given to them.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Section 171(2) of FA 1993 (profits of Lloyd's underwriters charged only under Chapter 2 of Part 2 of this Act) is one example of another rule of law.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In determining whether or not this section applies in relation to an asset, it does not matter if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) "animal" means any animal or other living creature,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) "herd" includes a flock and any other collection of animals (however named), and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) "production herd" means, in relation to a farmer, a herd of animals of the same species (irrespective of breed) kept by the farmer wholly or mainly for the products obtainable from the living animal which the animals produce for the farmer to sell.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For this purpose "the products obtainable from the living animal" means- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) There is an exception to this rule if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the nature of the land on which the herd is kept means that animals which die or cease to be part of the herd can be replaced only by animals bred and reared on the land,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This applies unless a different basis period is given by one of the following sections-

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any of the following steps may be taken if they are necessary in order to arrive at the profits or losses of the basis period- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Step 3</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Add together the number of days in all overlap periods ending before the end of the tax year.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the case of the property business of a firm, the basic rules in sections 264 and 265 are explained in section 859(2) and (3).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section operates for the purposes of sections 284 (sales with right to reconveyance) and 285 (sale and leaseback transactions).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subsection (3) explains how to determine for the purposes of section 284 the price at which an estate or interest is to be reconveyed when- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the date on which the estate or interest would fall to be reconveyed is not fixed under the terms of the sale, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the price at which it is to be reconveyed varies with the date.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The price is taken to be the lowest possible under the terms of the sale.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Subsection (5) explains how to determine for the purposes of section 285 the total of- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the value on the date of the sale of the right to receive a conveyance of the reversion immediately after the lease begins to run,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>when the date for the grant of the lease is not fixed under the terms of the sale and the total varies with the date.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The total is taken to be the lowest possible under the terms of the sale.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the purposes of sections 284(3) and 285(4) (receipts of property business for tax year in which estate or interest sold) an estate or interest in land is sold when any of the following occurs- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) an unconditional contract for its sale is entered into,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The rule in section 288 (the additional calculation rule) applies in relation to the calculation of receipts under- 

<UL>section 277 (lease premiums),

<P>section 279 (sums payable instead of rent),

<P>section 280 (sums payable for surrender of lease),

<P>section 281 (sums payable for variation or waiver of term of lease), or

<P>section 282 (assignments for profit of lease granted at undervalue).</UL>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It applies if conditions A and B are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Condition A is that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in the case of a receipt under section 277, 279 or 280, the lease is granted out of a taxed lease,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) in the case of a receipt under section 281, the lease was granted out of a taxed lease, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) in the case of a receipt under section 282, the assignment is of a taxed lease.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A lease is a "taxed lease" for the purposes of this Chapter if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) there is a receipt under any of sections 277 to 282 in respect of the lease, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) there would be such a receipt, but for the operation of the additional calculation rule in the calculation of its amount.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>In this Chapter such a receipt is referred to as a "taxed receipt".</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Condition B is that the taxed receipt, or if there is more than one, at least one of them, has an unused amount.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) See section 290 for an explanation of when a taxed receipt has an "unused amount".<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="288"></a>288</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>The additional calculation rule</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The rule in this section applies if the conditions mentioned in section 287 are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The additional calculation rule is that the amount given by the formula in section 277, 279, 280, 281 or 282 must be reduced by the amount calculated in accordance with this section in order to give the amount of the receipt under calculation.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The amount of the reduction is- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) if there is one taxed receipt which has an unused amount, the basic relieving amount by reference to that receipt, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) if there is more than one taxed receipt which has an unused amount, the total of the basic relieving amounts by reference to each receipt,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>adjusted, if necessary, in the light of section 289(5) (reduction not to exceed amount being reduced).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The basic relieving amount by reference to a taxed receipt is given by the formula- 

<P align=center>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>A &times; LRP</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><HR></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><CENTER>TRP</CENTER></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>where- 

<P>A is the unreduced amount of the taxed receipt (which is, generally, the amount given by the formula in section 277, 279, 280, 281 or 282, but see section 290(2) to (4)),

<P>LRP is the receipt period of the receipt under calculation, and

<P>TRP is the receipt period of the taxed receipt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) But the basic relieving amount is different if section 289(2) or (4) applies (certain special cases).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the purposes of this Chapter, the "receipt period" of a receipt is- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in the case of a receipt under section 277 or 280, the effective duration of the lease,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) in the case of a receipt under section 279, the period in relation to which the sum payable instead of rent is payable,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) in the case of a receipt under section 281, the period for which the variation or waiver has effect, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) in the case of a receipt under section 282, the effective duration of the lease remaining at the date of the assignment.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="289"></a>289</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>The additional calculation rule: special cases</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section explains how section 288 operates in some special cases.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the receipt under calculation is under any of sections 277 to 281, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the lease does not extend to the whole of the premises subject to the taxed lease,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>the basic relieving amount by reference to a taxed receipt is calculated by multiplying the amount given by the formula in subsection (4) of section 288 by the fraction of those premises which is subject to the lease.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) This fraction is calculated on a just and reasonable basis.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If the basic relieving amount given by section 288(4) or subsection (2) above by reference to a taxed receipt would otherwise exceed the unused amount of the taxed receipt, the basic relieving amount is the unused amount.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If the amount of the reduction under section 288 would otherwise exceed the amount given, in respect of the receipt under calculation, by the formula in section 277, 279, 280, 281 or 282, the amount of the reduction is equal to the amount given by the formula.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="290"></a>290</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Meaning of "unused amount" and "unreduced amount"</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a taxed receipt has an "unused amount" if the unreduced amount exceeds the total of the reductions and deductions referred to in subsection (5).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In this Chapter the "unreduced amount" of a taxed receipt is the amount given, in respect of the taxed receipt, by the formula in section 277, 279, 280, 281 or 282.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Subsection (4) applies to a taxed receipt under section 277 (lease premiums) as a result of section 278 (amount treated as lease premium where work required).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If the obligation to carry out work included the carrying out of work which gives, or will give, rise to qualifying expenditure under CAA 2001, the unreduced amount of the taxed receipt is calculated as if the obligation had not included the carrying out of that work.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The reductions and deductions mentioned in subsection (1) are- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the reductions under section 288 by reference to the taxed receipt,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the deductions allowed in calculating the profits of a trade, profession or vocation for expenses under section 61 (tenant under taxed lease who uses land in connection with trade treated as incurring expenses) by reference to the taxed receipt, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the deductions allowed in calculating the profits of a property business for expenses under section 292 (tenant under taxed lease who uses premises for purposes of property business treated as incurring expenses) by reference to the taxed receipt.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the purposes of this Chapter references to a reduction under section 288 by reference to a taxed receipt are to a reduction under that section so far as attributable to the taxed receipt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Section 292 (tenants under taxed leases treated as incurring expenses) applies in calculating the profits of a property business carried on by the tenant under a taxed lease for the purpose of making deductions for the expenses of the property business.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A deduction is allowed for an expense under section 292 for a qualifying day on which the whole or part of the premises subject to the taxed lease is- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) occupied by the tenant for the purpose of carrying on the property business, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) sublet.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) But any deduction for an expense under section 292 is subject to the application of any provision of Chapter 4 of Part 2 (as applied to property businesses by section 272).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The amount of the deduction for an expense under section 292 for a qualifying day by reference to a taxed receipt may be reduced in order to comply with section 295 (limit on reductions and deductions).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the meaning of expressions used in this section, see in particular-

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The tenant under a taxed lease is treated as incurring an expense of a revenue nature in respect of the premises subject to the taxed lease for each qualifying day.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If there is more than one taxed receipt, this section applies separately in relation to each of them.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A day is a "qualifying day", in relation to a taxed receipt, if it falls within the receipt period of the taxed receipt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The amount of the expense for the qualifying day by reference to the taxed receipt is given by the formula-

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><CENTER>A</CENTER></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><HR></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>TRP</TD></TR>

<P>where- 

<P>A is the unreduced amount of the taxed receipt, and

<P>TRP is the number of days in the receipt period of the taxed receipt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) This section is subject to sections 293 and 294 (restrictions on expenses where the additional calculation rule is relevant).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the meaning of expressions used in this section, see in particular-

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies if, in calculating the amount of a receipt ("the lease premium receipt"), there is a reduction under section 288 (the additional calculation rule) by reference to the taxed receipt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subsections (3) to (5) provide for the application of section 292 for a qualifying day that falls within the receipt period of the lease premium receipt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The tenant under the taxed lease is treated as incurring an expense under section 292 for the qualifying day by reference to the taxed receipt only if the daily amount of the taxed receipt exceeds the daily reduction of the lease premium receipt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If the condition in subsection (3) is met, the amount of the expense under section 292 for the qualifying day by reference to the taxed receipt is equal to that excess.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If the qualifying day falls within the receipt periods of more than one lease premium receipt, the reference in subsection (3) to the daily reduction of the lease premium receipt is to be read as a reference to the total of the daily reductions of each of the lease premium receipts whose receipt period includes the qualifying day.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In this section- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Section 294 explains how this section operates if the lease premium receipt is in respect of a lease that has been granted out of the taxed lease and does not extend to the whole of the premises subject to the taxed lease.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Rule 1</I>: A lease is not to be treated as having been granted for a term longer than one ending on a date before the end of the term for which the lease was granted if- <UL>(a)- the terms of the lease or any other circumstances make it unlikely that the lease will continue beyond that date, and<P>(b)- the premium was not substantially greater than it would have been had the term been one ending on that date.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Rule 2</I>: If the terms of the lease include provision for the extension of the lease beyond a given date by notice given by the tenant, account may be taken of any circumstances making it likely that the lease will be so extended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><I>Rule 3</I>: If the tenant or a person connected with the tenant is, or may become, entitled to a further lease or the grant of a further lease (whenever commencing)- <UL>(a)&nbsp;of the same premises, or<P>(b)&nbsp;of premises including the whole or part of the same premises,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>the term of the lease may be treated as continuing until the end of the term of the further lease.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The rules are to be applied in accordance with section 304.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In this section and section 304, in relation to Scotland, "term", where referring to the duration of a lease, means period.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The rules in section 303 apply by reference to the facts known or ascertainable- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) at the time of the grant of the lease, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) if the determination is for the purposes of section 281 (sums payable for variation or waiver of term of lease), at the time when the contract for the variation or waiver is entered into.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In applying those rules, it is assumed that all parties concerned, whatever their relationship, act as if they were at arm's length.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) special benefits were conferred by the lease or in connection with its grant, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) payments were made which one would not expect to be made by parties acting at arm's length unless such benefits had been conferred.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) But subsection (5) does not apply if it can be shown that the special benefits were not conferred nor the payments made for the purpose of securing a tax advantage in the application of this Chapter or sections 34 to 39 of ICTA (premiums, leases at undervalue etc.).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In applying rule 1 in section 303, it is assumed that the special benefits would not have been conferred nor the payments made if the lease had been granted for a term ending on the date mentioned in that rule.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In this section "special benefits" means benefits other than- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For subsequent tax years in the deduction period, the entitlement to any deduction under section 315 depends on whether the interest transferred is in the whole of the premises or in part of them.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If the interest transferred is in the whole of the premises, the transferee (but not the transferor) is entitled to any deduction under section 315.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If a new lease of the premises is granted and the new tenant makes a payment in respect of the embankment in question to the old tenant, the transferee is the new tenant.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) whether the person within the charge to income tax is entitled to a deduction (or part of a deduction) under section 315, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of sections 325 and 326 "the relevant period" for accommodation let by a person in a tax year is determined as follows.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the accommodation was not let by the person as furnished accommodation in the previous tax year, "the relevant period" is 12 months beginning with the first day in the tax year on which it is let by the person as furnished accommodation.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Accommodation which is let by a person during a tax year is "qualifying holiday accommodation" for the tax year if the availability, letting and pattern of occupation conditions are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The availability condition is that, during the relevant period, the accommodation is available for commercial letting as holiday accommodation to the public generally for at least 140 days.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) For the purposes of the letting condition, a letting of accommodation for a period of longer-term occupation (see subsection (6)) is not a letting of it as holiday accommodation.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The pattern of occupation condition is that, during the relevant period, not more than 155 days fall during periods of longer-term occupation.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The under-used accommodation so specified is treated as qualifying holiday accommodation for the tax year if the average of the number of let days for the tax year of all the accommodation specified in the election is at least 70.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) "The number of let days" for a tax year of any accommodation is the number of days during the relevant period for which it is commercially let by the person as holiday accommodation to members of the public.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The person liable for any tax charged under this Chapter is the person making the disposal.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The general rule is that a security is a "deeply discounted security" for the purposes of this Chapter if, as at the time it is issued, the amount payable on maturity or any other possible occasion of redemption ("A") exceeds or may exceed the issue price by more than- 

<P align=center> A &times; 0.5% &times; Y,

<P>where Y is the number of years in the redemption period or 30, whichever is the lower.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the redemption period is not a number of complete years, for the purposes of subsection (1) the incomplete year is expressed as twelfths, treating each complete month and any remaining part of a month as one-twelfth.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In this section "redemption period" means the period between the date of issue and the date of the occasion of redemption in question.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Interest payable on an occasion of redemption is ignored in determining for the purposes of this section the amount payable on that occasion.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of this section, in the case of an issue to which section 442 applies (securities issued in accordance with qualifying earn-out right), the issue price of the security is to be taken as the amount paid to acquire it (see section 442(2)).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The general rule in subsection (1) is subject to- 

<UL>section 431 (excluded occasions of redemption),

<P>section 432 (securities which are not deeply discounted securities),

<P>sections 434 to 436 (securities issued in separate tranches), and

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="431"></a>431</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Excluded occasions of redemption</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) An occasion of redemption of a security other than maturity is ignored for the purposes of section 430(1) if the third-party option conditions or the commercial protection conditions are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The third-party option conditions are that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the security may be redeemed on the occasion at the option of a person other than its holder,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the security is issued to a person who is not connected with the issuer, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the obtaining of a tax advantage by any person is not the main benefit, or one of the main benefits, that might have been expected to accrue from the provision in accordance with which the security may be redeemed on the occasion.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The commercial protection conditions are that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the security may be redeemed on the occasion as the result of an exercise of an option that is exercisable only on the occurrence of- </UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL><UL>(i) an event adversely affecting the holder (see subsection (8)), or</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL><UL>(ii) a default by any person, and</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) as at the time of the security's issue it appears unlikely that the option will be exercisable on the occasion.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Subsection (1) does not apply to an occasion just because the occasion coincides or may coincide with an occasion meeting the third-party option conditions or the commercial protection conditions.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the only reason that a security is not a deeply discounted security is that an occasion on which it may be redeemed is ignored because the third-party option conditions are met, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) at some time after its issue the security is acquired by, or its holder becomes, a person connected with the issuer,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>in relation to that time and later this Chapter applies as if the security were a deeply discounted security.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) If a person ("P") who is not connected with the issuer acquires- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) a security which is only a deeply discounted security because it was issued to a person connected with the issuer and so fails to meet the condition specified in subsection (2)(b), or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) a security within subsection (5),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>this Chapter applies in relation to P as if the security ceased to be a deeply discounted security on the acquisition.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) For the purposes of the application of this section to a security, the question whether persons are connected is determined without regard to the security or any other security issued under the same prospectus.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) In this section "event adversely affecting the holder", in relation to a security, means an event the occurrence of which appears, as at the time of the security's issue, likely to have an adverse effect on the interests of its holder at the time of the event if there were no provision for redemption on its occurrence.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="432"></a>432</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Securities which are not deeply discounted securities</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The following are not deeply discounted securities- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) shares in a company,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) gilt-edged securities that are not strips,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) life assurance policies, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) capital redemption policies.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) An excluded indexed security (see section 433) is only a deeply discounted security if treated as such under section 431(5) (acquisition by a person connected with the issuer or holder becoming such a person).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In this section "capital redemption policies" has the same meaning as in Chapter 9 of this Part (see section 473(2)).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) See also sections 434 to 436 (rules under which securities issued under the same prospectus on separate occasions may be treated as being, or as not being, deeply discounted securities).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="433"></a>433</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Meaning of "excluded indexed security"</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In this Chapter "excluded indexed security" means a security under the terms of which the amount payable on redemption is determined by applying to the amount for which the security was issued the percentage change (if any) over the security's redemption period in- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the value of chargeable assets of a particular description, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) an index of the value of such assets.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The fact that the terms under which the security is issued include a provision to the effect that the amount payable on its redemption must be at least a specified percentage of the amount for which it was issued only prevents it from falling within the definition in subsection (1) if that percentage exceeds 10%.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Interest payable on redemption is ignored in determining for the purposes of this section the amount payable on redemption.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In subsection (1) "redemption period" means- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the period beginning with the date of issue and ending with the date of redemption, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) a period which is or includes almost all that period and only differs from it for purposes connected with giving effect to a valuation in relation to rights or liabilities under the security.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) An asset is a chargeable asset for the purposes of subsection (1) if a gain accruing to a person on its disposal would be a chargeable gain for the purposes of TCGA 1992 on the assumptions specified in subsection (6).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The assumptions are that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the asset is an asset of the person,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the person is not entitled to the exemption conferred by section 100 of TCGA 1992 (exemption for authorised unit trusts etc.),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) disposal of the asset by the person would not be treated for income tax purposes as a disposal in the course of a trade, profession or vocation, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) section 116(10) of TCGA 1992 is ignored (chargeable gains on subsequent disposals of qualifying corporate bonds acquired in reorganisations, conversions and reconstructions).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) For the purposes of this section- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) neither the retail prices index nor any similar general index of prices published by the government of a territory or by an agent of such a government is an index of the value of chargeable assets, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) "redemption", in relation to a security, does not include its redemption on an occasion which is to be ignored under section 431(1) (excluded occasions of redemption).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Sections 435 and 436 set out rules under which securities issued under the same prospectus on separate occasions may be treated as being, or as not being, deeply discounted securities.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If any of the securities in the original issue under the prospectus is a deeply discounted security- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the rule in section 435 applies to securities in later issues under it, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the rule in section 436 does not apply to any securities issued under it.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If none of the securities in the original issue under the prospectus is a deeply discounted security, the rule in section 435 applies to securities in a later issue except where the rule in section 436 applies.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The rule in this section is that if securities in any of the issues made on separate occasions under the same prospectus are not deeply discounted securities, securities in any later issue under it are not deeply discounted securities, unless they are treated as such for one of the reasons specified in subsection (2).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The reasons are- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) that the securities were issued to a person connected with the issuer and so fail to meet the condition specified in section 431(2)(b), and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that such a person has acquired or become the holder of the securities and so section 431(5) applies to them.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section only applies if some of the securities in one or more later issues under the same prospectus are deeply discounted securities (or are such securities if the rule in section 435 is ignored).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The rule in this section applies for any disposal or acquisition after the time when the condition specified in subsection (3) is first met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The condition is that the aggregate nominal value as at a particular time of the securities within subsection (1) exceeds the aggregate nominal value as at that time of all the other securities issued under the prospectus at any time.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The rule is that all securities issued under the prospectus (including those issued after the time when the condition specified in subsection (3) is first met) are to be treated as deeply discounted securities and as having been acquired as such (whenever actually issued or acquired).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Subsection (6) applies where the question is whether a security held by a person who is not connected with the issuer is a deeply discounted security as a result of the rule in this section.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the purpose of determining whether the rule in this section applies, securities that are only within subsection (1) for one of the reasons specified in section 435(2) are treated as not being within it.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A person's loss on a disposal for the purposes of section 454 (relief for losses) is the amount by which the deductible costs exceed the amount payable on the disposal.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A calculation is to be made in accordance with section 511 in relation to each relevant transaction during the insurance year to determine- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In this section and sections 511 to 514 "relevant transaction" means- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) a surrender of part of or a share in the rights under the policy or contract, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) if so, the amount of the gain.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There is a gain if the transaction value for the relevant transaction (see subsection (4)) exceeds the amount of available premium left for the relevant transaction as calculated in accordance with section 512.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a disposal of a future or option involves guaranteed returns if conditions A to C are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Condition A is that the disposal is one of two or more related transactions (see section 566).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Condition B is that those transactions are designed to produce a guaranteed return (see subsection (5)).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Condition C is that the guaranteed return comprises- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the return from the disposal (see section 561), or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the return from a number of disposals of futures or options, of which the disposal is one, taken together.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of this Chapter, two or more related transactions are transactions designed to produce a guaranteed return if, taking them together, it would be reasonable to assume from one or more of the matters specified in subsection (6) that- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the main purpose of the transactions is or was the production of a guaranteed return from one or more disposals of futures or options (see section 560), or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that is or was one of their main purposes.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Those matters are- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the likely effect of the transactions,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the circumstances in which the transactions are entered into, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the circumstances in which any one of the transactions is entered into.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In the case of a transaction which is a disposal, the references in subsection (6) to entering into the transaction are references to making the disposal.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a guaranteed return is produced from a disposal of a future or option if risks from fluctuations in the underlying subject matter are so eliminated or reduced as to produce a return from the disposal that meets conditions A and B.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If there is more than one such disposal, a guaranteed return is produced from them if, taking them together, such risks are so eliminated or reduced.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Condition A is that the amount of the return is not to any significant extent attributable (otherwise than incidentally) to any such fluctuations.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Condition B is that the return equates, in substance, to the return on an investment of money at interest.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), the cases where risks from fluctuations in the underlying subject matter are eliminated or reduced include any case where the main reason or one of the main reasons for the choice of that subject matter is- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) that there appears to be no risk that it will fluctuate, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) that the risk that it will do so appears insignificant.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In this section the references, in relation to a disposal of a future or option, to the underlying subject matter are references to, or to the value of, the commodities, currencies, shares, stock or securities, interest rates, indices or other matters- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to which the future or option is referable, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) to the value of which it is referable.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In this Chapter, references to the return from one or more disposals are references to the return on investment represented by- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the total net profits and gains arising from the disposal or disposals, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) all but an insignificant part of those net profits and gains.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), if there are two or more disposals, it is to be assumed that profits and gains realised, and losses made, by persons who are associated with each other are all realised or made by the same person.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), persons are associated with each other in relation to any two or more disposals if conditions A to C are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Condition A is that the disposals are made in pursuance of the same scheme or arrangements.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Condition B is that each of the persons shares or is to share in the net return represented by the total of all the profits, gains and losses realised or made on the disposals.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Condition C is that the extent of the persons' shares is determined for the purposes of, or in accordance with, the scheme or arrangements.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) For the purposes of this section- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) "scheme or arrangements" includes understandings of any kind, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Any question whether there is a disposal for the purposes of this Chapter, or as to when such a disposal is made, is to be determined- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in accordance with sections 143(5) and (6), 144 and 144A of TCGA 1992 (closing out and settlement of futures contracts and rules in relation to options),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) otherwise in accordance with the provisions having effect for determining for the purposes of TCGA 1992 whether or when an asset has been disposed of, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) on assumptions A to C.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Assumption A is that all futures are assets for the purposes of TCGA 1992.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Assumption B is that the words "in the course of dealing in commodity or financial futures" are omitted from section 143(5) and (6) of TCGA 1992 in each place where they occur.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Assumption C is that any reference in TCGA 1992 to a financial option within the meaning given by section 144(8) of that Act is a reference to any option that at the time of the disposal in question is not listed on a recognised stock exchange or recognised futures exchange (regardless of whether the conditions in section 144(8)(c)(i) to (iv) of that Act are met).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Subsection (1) is subject to section 563 (timing of certain grants of options where related disposals occur later), and see also section 564 (deemed disposal where futures run to delivery or options are exercised).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="563"></a>563</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Timing of certain grants of options where related disposals occur later</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purpose of this Chapter, a disposal consisting in the grant of an option ("the grant") is treated as taking place at a later time than it would be taken as occurring under section 562 if conditions A to C are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Condition A is that the grant is one of a number of related transactions designed to produce a guaranteed return.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Condition B is that at least one of the other transactions is a transaction entered into after the grant.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Condition C is that one or more of the transactions entered into after the grant is a disposal which is not itself the grant of an option.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The grant is treated as taking place when the first such later disposal takes place.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Subsection (5) does not apply in any case where, by applying sections 144(2) and 144A(2) of TCGA 1992, section 562(1)- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) requires the grant of an option and the transaction entered into by the grantor in fulfilment of the grantor's obligations under the option to be treated as a single transaction, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) determines when such a single transaction is to be treated as entered into,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>and that requirement or determination has a different effect from subsection (5).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="564"></a>564</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Deemed disposal where futures run to delivery or options are exercised</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section applies if there are two or more related transactions (see section 566) in relation to which conditions A and B are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Condition A is that one of the transactions is the creation or acquisition (by the making or receiving of a grant or otherwise) of a future or option.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Condition B is that the other transaction or one of the other transactions- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) is the running of the future to delivery or the exercise of the option, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) is not treated for the purposes of this Chapter as a disposal of a future or option.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In relation to the parties to the future or option, this Chapter applies as if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) a disposal of the future or option takes place at the time ("the relevant time") immediately before the future runs to delivery or, as the case may be, the option is exercised, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) the scheme or arrangements by reference to which the transactions are related transactions provide for the disposal.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In the case of a person whose rights and entitlements under the future or option have a market value at the relevant time, the disposal referred to in subsection (4)(a) is taken to be for a consideration equal to that market value.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In the case of any other party to the future or option ("P"), the disposal is taken- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to be made for a nil consideration, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) to involve P in incurring costs equal to the release amount.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In subsection (6) "the release amount" means the amount which P might reasonably have been expected to pay, in a transaction at arm's length entered into at the relevant time, for the release of P's obligations and liabilities under the future or option.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Section 144(2) and (3) of TCGA 1992 are ignored for the purposes of subsections (1) to (3).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="565"></a>565</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>Interpretation of section 564</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) References in section 564 to the running of a future to delivery are references to performing (and so discharging) the obligations owed under the commodity or financial futures contract in question to the party to the future whose rights as a party relate to the underlying subject matter.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In subsection (1) the reference to the underlying subject matter is a reference to, or to the value of, the commodities, currencies, shares, stock or securities, interest rates, indices or other matters- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) to which the future is referable, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) to the value of which it is referable.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In section 564 and this section "party", in relation to a future or option, means one of the persons who- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) has any right or entitlement comprised in or arising under the future or option, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) is subject to any obligation or liability so comprised or arising.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In section 564 "market value" has the same meaning as in TCGA 1992 (see sections 272 to 274).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top><B><a name="566"></a>566</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD valign=top><B>When transactions are related</B><BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, two or more transactions are related if all of them are entered into in pursuance of the same scheme or arrangements.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For this purpose the cases where any two or more transactions are to be taken to be entered into in pursuance of the same scheme or arrangements include any case where it would be reasonable to assume from one or more of the matters specified in subsection (3) that none of them would have been entered into independently of the others.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The matters are- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the likely effect of the transactions,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) the circumstances in which any one of the transactions is entered into.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Nothing in this Chapter prevents transactions from being related transactions just because they are transactions- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) with different parties, or</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) with parties different from the parties to the scheme or arrangements in pursuance of which they are entered into.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) In the case of a transaction which is a disposal, the references in this section to entering into the transaction are references to making the disposal.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In this section "scheme or arrangements" includes schemes, arrangements and understandings of any kind, whether or not they are legally enforceable.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The losses are not to be brought into account for income tax purposes, except where section 392 of ICTA (losses from miscellaneous transactions) applies.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of that section, the losses are taken to be made at the time when the disposal occurs.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) For the treatment of the losses for capital gains tax purposes, and how TCGA 1992 applies where a profit arises or a loss is made from a deemed disposal under section 564(4), see sections 148A to 148C of that Act.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) In this section "trustees" does not include personal representatives, but where, during or at the end of the administration period, personal representatives pay trustees any sum representing profits or gains to which this section would apply if the personal representatives were trustees, that sum is treated as- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Inland Revenue may by notice require any party to a settlement to provide them, within such period as they may direct, with such particulars as they consider necessary for the purposes of this Chapter.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The rule is that references in this Chapter to income arising under a settlement do not include income arising under the settlement in that tax year in respect of which the settlor, if the settlor were actually entitled to it, would not be chargeable to income tax by deduction or otherwise because of the settlor not being domiciled in the United Kingdom, UK resident or ordinarily UK resident.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The income is treated for the purposes of this Chapter as arising under the settlement in the year in which it is remitted.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The exemption in section 717(1) does not apply to payments made under the annuities specified in subsection (2).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The annuities are- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) an annuity the whole or part of the consideration for which consisted of sums satisfying the conditions for relief under section 266 of ICTA (life assurance premiums),</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This section sets out the rules for determining the extent to which an annuity payment is within the exemption in section 717(1).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The rules depend on- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the amount of the annuity payments depends solely on the duration of a human life or lives, the same proportion of each payment ("the exempt proportion") is exempt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) But if the amount of the annuity payments also depends on another contingency, each payment is exempt so far as it does not exceed a fixed sum ("the exempt sum").<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If an annuity payment within subsection (4) is less than the exempt sum, the shortfall is added to the exempt sum for the next payment (and so on).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The ways to determine the exempt proportion and the exempt sum differ according to whether or not the annuity's term depends solely on the duration of a human life or lives.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) If the annuity's term depends solely on the duration of a human life or lives- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the exempt proportion is the proportion which is just and reasonable, having regard to the contingencies affecting the annuity and to section 720, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Chapter provides relief on income from the use of furnished accommodation in an individual's only or main residence.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>The relief is referred to in this Chapter as "rent-a-room relief".</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The form of relief depends on whether the individual's total rent-a-room amount exceeds the individual's limit (see sections 788 to 790).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If it does not, the income is not charged to income tax unless the individual elects otherwise (see sections 791 to 794).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If it does, the individual may elect for alternative methods of calculating the income (see sections 795 to 798).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) "Taxable income" means receipts or other income in respect of which the individual is liable to income tax for the tax year.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A relevant trade, letting or agreement is one from which the individual derives rent-a-room receipts for the tax year.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Chapter an individual has rent-a-room receipts for a tax year if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) the receipts are in respect of the use of furnished accommodation in a residence in the United Kingdom or in respect of goods or services supplied in connection with that use,</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(c) for some or all of that period the residence is the individual's only or main residence, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(d) the receipts would otherwise be brought into account in calculating the profits of a trade or UK property business or chargeable to income tax under Chapter 8 of Part 5 (income not otherwise charged).</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Meals, cleaning and laundry are examples of goods or services supplied in connection with the use of furnished accommodation in a residence.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the receipts would otherwise be brought into account in calculating the profits of a trade, the income period is the basis period for the tax year (see Chapter 15 of Part 2).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Otherwise the income period is the period which- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of this Chapter an individual's limit for a tax year depends on whether the individual meets the exclusive receipts condition for the tax year (see section 790).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the individual does, the individual's limit for the tax year is the basic amount for the tax year.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Chapter provides relief on income from the provision by an individual of foster care.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>The relief is referred to in this Chapter as "foster-care relief".</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The form of relief depends on whether the individual's total foster-care receipts exceed the individual's limit (see sections 807 to 811).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If they do not, the income is not charged to income tax (see sections 812 to 814).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If they do, the individual may elect for an alternative method of calculating the income (see sections 815 to 819).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If the foster-care receipts are the receipts of a trade, special rules apply - <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) if the period of account of the trade does not end on 5th April (see sections 820 to 823), and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) "Taxable income" means receipts or other income in respect of which the individual is liable to income tax for the tax year.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the receipts would otherwise be brought into account in calculating the profits of a trade, the income period is the basis period for the tax year (see Chapter 15 of Part 2).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A person may make a claim for a tax year for the person's relevant foreign income to be charged for that year in accordance with section 832.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The claim must state that condition A or B is met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Condition B is that the person is not ordinarily UK resident.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) This section does not apply to relevant foreign income arising in the Republic of Ireland.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If a person makes a claim under section 831(1) for a tax year in respect of relevant foreign income, income tax is charged on the full amount of the sums received in the United Kingdom in the tax year in respect of the income.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), it does not matter whether the income arises in the year for which the claim is made or arose in an earlier year in which the person was UK resident.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The only case in which deductions are allowed is where the income is from a trade, profession or vocation carried on outside the United Kingdom.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In that case the same deductions are allowed as are allowed under the Income Tax Acts where the trade, profession or vocation is carried on in the United Kingdom.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the purposes of section 832, if a person who is ordinarily resident, but is not domiciled, in the United Kingdom uses relevant foreign income outside the United Kingdom to satisfy a UK-linked debt, the person is treated as receiving the income in the United Kingdom at the time when it is so used.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Subsection (1) is subject to subsection (5).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In subsection (1) "UK-linked debt", in relation to a person, means- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL><UL>(ii) another debt falling within this paragraph.</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In the case of a debt (within subsection (3)(b) or (c)) for money lent to the person outside the United Kingdom, it does not matter whether the money lent is received in the United Kingdom before or after the income is used to satisfy the debt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) But in the case of such a debt if the money lent is not received in the United Kingdom until after the income is so used, the person is treated as receiving the income in the United Kingdom when the money lent is received there (instead of at the time provided in subsection (1)).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) For the purposes of this section, if any of the money lent is used to satisfy a debt, the debt for the money so used is treated as incurred for satisfying that other debt.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In subsections (3) to (5) any reference to money lent being received in the United Kingdom includes a reference to its being brought there.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A person to whom money has been lent ("the borrower") is treated for the purposes of section 833 as using relevant foreign income to satisfy a debt if conditions A and B are met.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Condition A is that the borrower uses the income in such a way that the lender holds money or property representing the income on behalf or on account of the borrower in such circumstances that it is available to the lender to satisfy the debt (by set-off or otherwise).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Condition B is that under an arrangement between the borrower and the lender- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In this section "lender", in relation to money lent, includes any person for the time being entitled to repayment.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If section 832 (relevant foreign income charged on the remittance basis) applies to income for a tax year, the person liable for the tax may make a claim for relief under this section in respect of any of the income which meets conditions A and B ("delayed income").<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Condition A is that the income arose before the tax year for which relief is claimed.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Condition B is that the income could not have been transferred by the person to the United Kingdom before the tax year because of- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) If a person claims relief for a tax year in respect of delayed income, that income is to be deducted from the income charged to tax for that year in accordance with section 832.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The delayed income is to be treated as if it were income received in the United Kingdom in the tax year in which it arose.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The condition in section 835(3) only applies to the pension, annuity or increase in the period after it becomes payable.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
