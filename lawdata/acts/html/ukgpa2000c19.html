<TD valign=top><UL>(a) if (apart from this sub-paragraph) there would be a difference between the two Steps in the level of salary taken as the level by reference to which any salary-related benefits are to be computed, the level used for Step 4 must be no lower than that used for Step 6; and</UL></TD></TR>
