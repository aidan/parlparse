<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A quality partnership scheme is a scheme under which- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) In considering whether to make a quality partnership scheme, a local transport authority must have regard to the desirability, in appropriate cases, of making a scheme jointly with another such authority.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The date specified in the scheme as that on which it is to come into operation must not be earlier than the date by which, in the opinion of the authority or authorities, it will be reasonably practicable- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Not later than 14 days after the date on which the scheme is made, the authority or authorities must give notice- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><FONT size=2>Postponement of scheme.</FONT></TD>
<TD valign=top><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="117"></a>117.</B> - (1) If it appears to the authority or authorities appropriate to do so, they may decide that the date on which the scheme would otherwise come into operation shall be postponed by such period, not exceeding 12 months, as they think fit.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Before making such a decision they must consult all operators of local services who would, in their opinion, be affected by the scheme.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Not later than 14 days after the date on which any such decision is made they must give notice of the decision- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) in at least one newspaper circulating in the area to which the scheme relates, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>

<TR><TD valign=top><FONT size=2>Effect of scheme.</FONT></TD>
<TD valign=top><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="118"></a>118.</B> - (1) The authority or authorities must- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) But subsection (1) does not apply in relation to any period during which the authority or authorities are temporarily unable to provide the facilities owing to circumstances beyond their control.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Nor does it apply in the case of the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales if he or it is unable to provide the facilities owing to the variation or revocation of a traffic regulation order.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The operator of a local service may not use facilities provided under a quality partnership scheme unless- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) he has given a written undertaking to the traffic commissioner for each traffic area covering the whole or part of the area to which the scheme relates that he will provide the service to the standard specified in the scheme when using the facilities, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(b) he provides the service to that standard when using the facilities, except in relation to any period during which he is temporarily unable to do so owing to circumstances beyond his control.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) But subsection (4) does not apply in relation to services which are excluded from the scheme as a result of any provision of the scheme made in accordance with section 116(3).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Where the exclusion of a local service from the scheme is made subject to conditions as a result of such a provision, those conditions are to be treated, during any period in which the scheme is in operation, as if they were prescribed particulars registered under section 6 of the Transport Act 1985 (registration of local services) of the service concerned.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><FONT size=2>Regulations about schemes involving existing facilities.</FONT></TD>
<TD valign=top><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="119"></a>119.</B> - (1) The appropriate national authority may by regulations make provision about the specifying in quality partnership schemes of facilities which are already being provided before the schemes are proposed ("existing facilities").<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The regulations may in particular- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(e) make provision modifying any provision of sections 115 to 117 in relation to schemes which specify existing facilities.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top><FONT size=2>Variation or revocation of schemes.</FONT></TD>
<TD valign=top><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="120"></a>120.</B> - (1) The authority or authorities who made a quality partnership scheme may vary the scheme if they decide that it is appropriate to do so.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The authority or authorities who made a scheme may revoke it before the end of the period for which it would otherwise remain in operation if all persons who have given an undertaking to provide a service to the standard specified in the scheme consent to the revocation of the scheme; and such consent must not be unreasonably withheld.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the variation of a scheme under subsection (1) would require the making of a traffic regulation order, the variation is subject to the same procedure as the making of a scheme.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any other variation of a scheme under subsection (1), or the revocation of a scheme under subsection (2), is subject to that procedure, except to the extent that the procedure is modified by regulations made under section 122.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the exclusion of a local service from the scheme is made subject to conditions as a result of such a provision, those conditions are to be treated, during any period in which the scheme is in operation, as if they were prescribed particulars registered under section 6 of the Transport Act 1985 of the service concerned.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>the trade is not to be treated as permanently discontinued, nor a new trade as set up, for the purposes of the allowances and charges provided for by the Capital Allowances Acts, but sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) are to apply.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Sub-paragraph (2) is to affect the amounts falling to be taken into account in relation to the transferor as expenditure by reference to which capital allowances may be made only so far as necessary to give effect to a reduction of any such amount by a sum equal to so much of that amount as is allocated to the transferee as mentioned in sub-paragraph (3).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
