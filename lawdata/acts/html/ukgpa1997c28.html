<TD valign=top>1. Except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3, the owner at the time of an incident shall be liable for damage caused by any hazardous and noxious substances in connection with their carriage by sea on board the ship, provided that if an incident consists of a series of occurrences having the same origin the liability shall attach to the owner at the time of the first of such occurrences.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>2. No liability shall attach to the owner if the owner proves that:<P>

<UL>(a) the damage resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character; or<P>(b) the damage was wholly caused by an act or omission done with the intent to cause damage by a third party; or<P>(c) the damage was wholly caused by the negligence or other wrongful act of any Government or other authority responsible for the maintenance of lights or other navigational aids in the exercise of that function; or<P>(d) the failure of the shipper or any other person to furnish information concerning the hazardous and noxious nature of the substances shipped either

<P><UL>(i) has caused the damage, wholly or partly; or

<P>(ii) has led the owner not to obtain insurance in accordance with article 12;provided that neither the owner nor its servants or agents knew or ought reasonably to have known of the hazardous and noxious nature of the substances shipped.</UL></UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>3.

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>1. The owner of a ship shall be entitled to limit liability under this Convention in respect of any one incident to an aggregate amount calculated as follows:<P><UL>(a) 10 million units of account for a ship not exceeding 2,000 units of tonnage; and<P>(b) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that mentioned in (a):{/spara}for each unit of tonnage from 2,001 to 50,000 units of tonnage, 1,500 units of account</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>for each unit of tonnage in excess of 50,000 units of tonnage, 360 units of account</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>provided, however, that this aggregate amount shall not in any event exceed 100 million units of account.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>2. The owner shall not be entitled to limit liability under this Convention if it is proved that the damage resulted from the personal act or omission of the owner, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>3. The owner shall, for the purpose of benefitting from the limitation provided for in paragraph 1, constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of liability established in accordance with paragraph 1 with the court or other competent authority of any one of the States Parties in which action is brought under article 38 or, if no action is brought, with any court or other competent authority in any one of the States Parties in which an action can be brought under article 38. The fund can be constituted either by depositing the sum or by producing a bank guarantee or other guarantee, acceptable under the law of the State Party where the fund is constituted, and considered to be adequate by the court or other competent authority.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>4. Subject to the provisions of article 11, the fund shall be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the amounts of their established claims.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>5. If before the fund is distributed the owner or any of the servants or agents of the owner or any person providing to the owner insurance or other financial security has as a result of the incident in question, paid compensation for damage, such person shall, up to the amount that person has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this Convention.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>6. The right of subrogation provided for in paragraph 5 may also be exercised by a person other than those mentioned therein in respect of any amount of compensation for damage which such person may have paid but only to the extent that such subrogation is permitted under the applicable national law.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>7. Where owners or other persons establish that they may be compelled to pay at a later date in whole or in part any such amount of compensation, with regard to which the right of subrogation would have been enjoyed under paragraphs 5 or 6 had the compensation been paid before the fund was distributed, the court or other competent authority of the State where the fund has been constituted may order that a sufficient sum shall be provisionally set aside to enable such person at such later date to enforce the claim against the fund.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>8. Claims in respect of expenses reasonably incurred or sacrifices reasonably made by the owner voluntarily to prevent or minimize damage shall rank equally with other claims against the fund.<BR></TD></TR>


<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>9. <UL>(a) The amounts mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the constitution of the fund referred to in paragraph 3<P>The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.<P>(b) Nevertheless, a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 9(a) may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter, declare that the unit of account referred to in paragraph 9(a) shall be equal to 15 gold francs. The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five-and-a-half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.<P>(c) The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 9(a) and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 9(b) shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in paragraph 1 as would result from the application of the first two sentences of paragraph 9(a). States Parties shall communicate to the Secretary-General the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 9(a), or the result of the conversion in paragraph 9(b) as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.</UL></TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>11. The insurer or other person providing financial security shall be entitled to constitute a fund in accordance with this article on the same conditions and having the same effect as if it were constituted by the owner.

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD><TD align=center><BR><I>Article 12</I></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>1. The owner of a ship registered in a State Party and actually carrying hazardous and noxious substances shall be required to maintain insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or similar financial institution, in the sums fixed by applying the limits of liability prescribed in article 9, paragraph 1, to cover liability for damage under this Convention.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>2. A compulsory insurance certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be issued to each ship after the appropriate authority of a State Party has determined that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with. With respect to a ship registered in a State Party such compulsory insurance certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship's registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a State Party it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any State Party. This compulsory insurance certificate shall be in the form of the model set out in Annex I and shall contain the following particulars:<P>

<UL>(a) name of the ship, distinctive number or letters and port of registry;<P>(b) name and principal place of business of the owner;<P>(c) IMO ship identification number;<P>(d) type and duration of security;<P>(e) name and principal place of business of insurer or other person giving security and, where appropriate, place of business where the insurance or security is established; and<P>(f) period of validity of certificate, which shall not be longer than the period of validity of the insurance or other security.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>3. The compulsory insurance certificate shall be in the official language or languages of the issuing State. If the language used is neither English, nor French nor Spanish, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>4. The compulsory insurance certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship's registry or, if the ship is not registered in a State Party, with the authority of the State issuing or certifying the certificate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>5. An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this article if it can cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate under paragraph 2, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 4, unless the compulsory insurance certificate has been issued within the said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or security no longer satisfying the requirements of this article.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>6. The State of the ship's registry shall, subject to the provisions of this article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the compulsory insurance certificate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>7. Compulsory insurance certificates issued or certified under the authority of a State Party in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be accepted by other States Parties for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other States Parties as having the same force as compulsory insurance certificates issued or certified by them even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a State Party. A State Party may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying State should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the compulsory insurance certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>8. Any claim for compensation for damage may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security for the owner's liability for damage. In such case the defendant may, even if the owner is not entitled to limitation of liability, benefit from the limit of liability prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. The defendant may further invoke the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up of the owner) which the owner would have been entitled to invoke. Furthermore, the defendant may invoke the defence that the damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the owner, but the defendant shall not invoke any other defence which the defendant might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the owner against the defendant. The defendant shall in any event have the right to require the owner to be joined in the proceedings.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>9. Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>10. A State Party shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this article applies to trade unless a certificate has been issued under paragraph 2 or 12.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>11. Subject to the provisions of this article, each State Party shall ensure, under its national law, that insurance or other security in the sums specified in paragraph 1 is in force in respect of any ship, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or leaving an offshore facility in its territorial sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>12. If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a State Party, the provisions of this article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a compulsory insurance certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship's registry stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the ship's liability is covered within the limit prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. Such a compulsory insurance certificate shall follow as closely as possible the model prescribed by paragraph 2.</TD></TR>
