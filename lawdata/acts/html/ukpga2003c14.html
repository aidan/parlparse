<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Where subsection (4) applies and the contract is subsequently completed by a conveyance- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(a) both the contract and the transaction effected on completion are notifiable transactions, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) tax is chargeable on the latter transaction to the extent (if any) that the amount of tax chargeable on it is greater than the amount of tax chargeable on the contract.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Where subsection (4) applies and the contract is (to any extent) afterwards rescinded or annulled, or is for any other reason not carried into effect, the tax paid by virtue of that subsection shall (to that extent) be repaid by the Inland Revenue.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>Repayment must be claimed by amendment of the land transaction return made in respect of the contract.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Stamp duty is chargeable under Schedule 13 of the Finance Act 1999 (c. 16) only on instruments relating to stock or marketable securities.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Section 12 of the Finance Act 1895 (c. 16) (collection of stamp duty in cases of property vested by Act or purchased under statutory powers) does not apply to property other than stock or marketable securities.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) This section shall be construed as one with the Stamp Act 1891 (c. 39).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Part 1 of Schedule 20 to this Act contains provisions supplementing this section and Part 2 of that Schedule provides for consequential amendments and repeals.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where this section applies, the relevant loss shall be treated for the purposes of capital gains tax as if it were a loss accruing to the taxpayer in the earliest year which is an eligible year (the "first eligible year"), instead of in the year of the loss (but subject to, and in accordance with, the following provisions of this section).<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The amount of the relevant loss that falls to be deducted from chargeable gains of the first eligible year in accordance with section 2(2)(a) is limited to the amount (the "first year limit") found by taking the following steps- 

<P><UL><I>Step 1:</I> take the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the taxpayer in the first eligible year,

<P><I>Step 2:</I> exclude from that amount any amounts that fall to be disregarded in accordance with section 2(4)(a) for that year,

<P><I>Step 3:</I> deduct from the amount remaining any amounts in respect of allowable losses (other than the relevant loss or any part of it) that fall to be deducted from that amount in accordance with section 2(2) otherwise than by virtue of section 2(5)(aa)(i) (taking account of any previous elections under section 279A).<BR>&nbsp;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>The amount so found is the first year limit, unless the first eligible year is a year in relation to which section 2(5)(aa) has effect, in which case the further steps in subsection (4) below must also be taken.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Those further steps are- 

<P><UL><I>Step 4:</I> add to the amount found by taking steps 1 to 3 in subsection (3) above every amount which is treated by virtue of section 77 or 86 as an amount of chargeable gains accruing to the taxpayer for the first eligible year (the "attributed amounts"),

<P><I>Step 5:</I> deduct from the resulting amount any amounts (other than the relevant loss or any part of it) that fall to be deducted from the attributed amounts in accordance with section 2(5)(aa)(i) (taking account of any previous elections under section 279A).<BR>&nbsp;</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>The amount so found is the first year limit in a case where section 2(5)(aa) applies in relation to the first eligible year.</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) As respects any later year before the year of the loss, the relevant loss (so far as not previously allowed as a deduction from chargeable gains accruing in any previous year) falls to be deducted in accordance with section 2(2)(b) only if that later year is an eligible year.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The amount of the relevant loss that falls to be deducted from chargeable gains of that later eligible year in accordance with section 2(2)(b) is limited to the amount (the "later year limit") in respect of which the taxpayer would be chargeable to capital gains tax for that later year- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) If the lease in question is one of a number of linked transactions for which the chargeable consideration consists of or includes rent- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) a "rent review" means an adjustment in pursuance of such provision, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top><UL>(b) references to the date of a rent review are to the date from which any such adjustment has or would have effect.</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If the lease provides for a rent review on or before the end of the second year of the lease, section 51 (contingent, uncertain or unascertained consideration) applies in relation to the possibility that the rent may be adjusted on that review.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top><UL>(a) is determined without regard to the possibility of an adjustment on that review, and</UL></TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>the term of a lease is the period from the date of substantial performance of the agreement until the end of the contractual term specified in the lease.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>In this sub-paragraph "substantially performed" and "completion" have the same meanings as in section 44 (contract and conveyance).</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the annual rent exceeds &#163;600 a year, the 0&#37; band in the Tables in subsection (2) of section 55 does not apply and any case that would have fallen within that band is treated as falling within the 1&#37; band.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) the "annual rent" means the average annual rent over the term of the lease or, if- <BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD valign=top>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD valign=top>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Where a transaction to which this Schedule applies falls to be taken into account for the purposes of that section as a linked transaction, no account shall be taken of rent in determining the relevant consideration.<BR>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
