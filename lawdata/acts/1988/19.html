<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;that (whether or not the action has already commenced) members of the union are likely to be, or have been, induced by the union to take part or to continue to take part in that action; and</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;that the members of the union who are likely to be, or have been, so induced include the applicant,</ul>the court shall make such order as it considers appropriate for requiring the union to take steps (including the withdrawal of any relevant authorisation or endorsement) for ensuring that there is no, or no further, inducement of members of the union to take part or to continue to take part in that action and that no such member engages in any conduct after the making of the order by virtue of having been induced before the making of the order to take part or to continue to take part in the action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;For the purposes of this section a trade union has authorised or endorsed any industrial action if there has been&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;such an authorisation or endorsement of an act which has been done for inducing any member of the union to take part or to continue to take part in that action; or</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;such an authorisation of any proposed act for inducing such a member to take part or to continue to take part in that action,</ul>as requires that member, or if the act were done would require that member, to be treated for the purposes of this section as induced by the union to take part or, as the case may be, to continue to take part in that action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;For the purposes of this section a person shall be treated as induced by a trade union to take part or to continue to take part in any industrial action if he is subjected to such an inducement to take part or to continue to take part in that action as is or (if it constituted an inducement to break a contract of employment or to interfere with the performance of such a contract) would be taken, for the purposes of any such proceedings as are mentioned in subsection (2) of section 15 of the 1982 Act (liability of unions for official action), to have been done by the union.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;For the purposes of an application under this section an authorisation or endorsement by a trade union of any industrial action is without the support of a ballot unless&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;the trade union has held one or more ballots in respect of that action;</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;the applicant has been accorded entitlement to vote in the ballot or, as the case may be, in one of them;</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;the majority voting in that ballot have answered &quot;Yes&quot;&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;in the case of action which consists in a strike, to a question (however framed) which requires the person answering it to say, by answering &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, whether he is prepared to take part or, as the case may be, to continue to take part in a strike;</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;in the case of action which consists in action short of a strike, to a question (however framed) which requires the person answering it to say, by answering &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, whether he is prepared to take part or, as the case may be, to continue to take part in such action;</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;in the case of action which consists in action to which both of the questions mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) above are applicable, to the question or questions applicable to that part of the action in which the applicant is likely to be, or has been, induced to take part or to continue to take part;</ul>and</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;the first authorisation or endorsement of that industrial action and, in the case of any action which has been authorised rather than endorsed, the commencement of the action occurred or is likely to occur at a time after the date of that ballot and before the end of the period of four weeks beginning with that date.</ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;In this section references to an inducement, in relation to a member of a trade union, include references to an inducement which is or would be ineffective, whether because of that member's unwillingness to be influenced by it or for any other reason.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;In this section&#151;<ul>&quot;date of the ballot&quot; has the same meaning as in Part II of the 1984 Act;</ul>
<ul>&quot;industrial action&quot; means any strike or other industrial action by persons employed under contracts of employment;</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;something which is believed by the union to amount to any such conduct.</ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;Conduct by an individual falls within this subsection if&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;it consists in a failure to participate in or support any strike or other industrial action (whether by members of the trade union in question or by others) or indicates opposition to, or a lack of support for, any such strike or industrial action;</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;it consists in a failure to contravene, for any purpose connected with any such strike or other industrial action, any requirement imposed on that individual by or under a contract of employment or any other agreement between that individual and a person for whom he works or normally works;</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;it consists in the making (whether by the bringing of proceedings or otherwise) of any assertion that the union, any official or representative of the union or any trustee of any of the union's property has contravened, or is proposing to contravene, any requirement which is, or is thought to be, imposed by or under the rules of the union or any other agreement or by or under any enactment or rule of law;</ul>
