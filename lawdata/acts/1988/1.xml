<ul>&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, the highest total of premiums payable thereunder for any period of 12 months expiring before that time is less than one half of the highest total paid for any period of 12 months under the old policy, or under any related policy issued less than ten years before the issue of the new policy (&quot;related policy&quot;
 meaning any policy in relation to which the old policy was a new policy within the meaning of this paragraph, any policy in relation to which that policy was such a policy, and so on);</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;if the new policy would not apart from this paragraph be a qualifying policy, and would fail to be so by reason only of paragraph 1(2) or (3) or 2(1)(a), (b) or (c) above, it is nevertheless a qualifying policy if the old policy was a qualifying policy and&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;the old policy was issued in respect of an insurance made more than ten years before the taking effect of the new policy, and, subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, the premiums payable for any period of 12 months under the new policy do not exceed the smallest total paid for any such period under the old policy; or</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;where paragraph (a) above does not apply, that the person in respect of whom the new insurance is made became resident in the United Kingdom during the 12 months ending with the date of its issue;</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;that the issuing company certify that the new policy is in substitution for the old, and that the old was issued either by a branch or agency of theirs outside the United Kingdom or by a company outside the United Kingdom with whom they have arrangements for the issue of policies in substitution for ones held by persons coming to the United Kingdom; and</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;that the new policy confers on the holder benefits which are substantially equivalent to those which he would have enjoyed if the old policy had continued in force.</ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;Where the new policy is one issued on or after 1st April 1976 then, in determining under sub-paragraph (2) above whether that policy would or would not (apart from sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) above) be a qualifying policy, there shall be left out of account so much of the first premium payable thereunder as is accounted for by the value of the old policy.</td>

<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;the excess,</ul>whichever is the less, but the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a disposal falling within section 44(1) above.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;Sections 88 and 89 of the Finance Act 1982 (identification of securities disposed of) shall not apply to shares in respect of which any relief has been given and not withdrawn; and any question&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;as to which of any such shares issued to a person at different times a disposal relates; or</ul>
<ul>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;whether a disposal relates to such shares or to other shares;</ul>shall for the purposes of capital gains tax be determined as for the purposes of section 299 of the Taxes Act 1988, or section 57 of the Finance Act 1981 if the relief has only been given under that Act.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;Where an individual holds shares which form part of the ordinary share capital of a company and the relief has been given (and not withdrawn) in respect of some but not others, then, if there is within the meaning of section 77 above a reorganisation affecting those shares, section 78 shall apply separately to the shares in respect of which the relief has been given (and not withdrawn) and to the other shares (so that shares of each kind are treated as a separate holding of original shares and identified with a separate new holding).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;Where section 44 above has applied to any eligible shares disposed of by an individual to his or her spouse (&quot;the transferee&quot;), subsection (2) above shall apply in relation to the subsequent disposal of the shares by the transferee to a third party.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;Where section 85 or 86 above would, but for this subsection, apply in relation to eligible shares in respect of which an individual has been given relief, that section shall apply only if the relief is withdrawn.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;Sections 78 to 81 above shall not apply in relation to any shares in respect of which relief (other than relief under the 1981 Act) has been given and which form part of a company's ordinary share capital if&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;there is, by virtue of any such allotment for payment as is mentioned in section 77(2)(a) above, a reorganisation occurring after 18th March 1986 affecting those shares; and</ul>
