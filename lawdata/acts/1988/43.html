<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>56.</b></b>&#151;(1)&nbsp;This Part of this Act has effect for the purpose of conferring on any person who has been approved under section 57 below or Scottish Homes the right to acquire from a public sector landlord any house&#151;<ul>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;which, on the relevant date, is occupied by a qualifying tenant; and
(b) of which, on that date, the landlord is heritable proprietor,</ul>and any other heritable property of which, on that date, the landlord is heritable proprietor and which will reasonably serve a beneficial purpose in connection with the occupation of the house; and, in this Part of this Act, &quot;house&quot;
 includes any such property.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;In subsection (1) above, &quot;heritable proprietor&quot;
