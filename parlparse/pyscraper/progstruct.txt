Lords scraping: 

--------------------------------------
	lordscreatehansardindex.py

goes to 
		'http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/allddays.htm'

and makes the index file in 

	lordindex.xml

Where each line is of the form: 

<lordsdaydeb date="2004-01-29" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/ pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds04/index/40129-x.htm"/>

(the page of the index for that day)


--------------------------------------

	lordspullgluepages.py 

loops through all the lines in 

	lordindex.xml

and iterates through the "Next Page" links from the first page of the day, and glues them together, removing header and footer, into single files of the form: 

	lordspages/daylord2004-01-28.html


--------------------------------------

	lordsfilters.py 

loops through all the files 

	lordspages/*.html

and writes them into files of the form 

	scrapedxml/lords/daylord2004-01-28.xml


It does this by passing the text through a series of filters, each of which takes a text string of the whole file, and creates output into an output-stream.  The intermediate filters write to a stringstream, and the final filter writes to a filestream.  


--------------------
	LordsFilterColtime.py

takes lines of the form 

	<B>19 Nov 2003 : Column WS1926</B></P>

and converts to... 

It hopes to extract all the spurious paragraph marker inserts in the process.  




Todo.  get the names extracted filters
the times extracted. 
The chunking up thing running.
