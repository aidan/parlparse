  The Government set out its programme for the reform of the planning system in England in &quot;Sustainable Communities&#151;Delivering Through Planning&quot; (July 2002). The principal aims of the reform are to produce a faster, fairer system that allows for greater public involvement. The legislative changes required, including those for the reform of the development plan system, were enacted in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.
