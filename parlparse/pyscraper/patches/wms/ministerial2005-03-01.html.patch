+<a name="50301m01.html_para8"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Ivor Caplin):</b>
 <a name="50301m01.html_para9"> I have today signed a new call-out order made under Section 56 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 so that reservists may continue to be called out to support UN operations in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The current order has expired and this new order takes effect from 1 March 2005. There are no plans to call out Reservists compulsorily under this order as it is expected that the small numbers needed will be met through voluntary mobilisation.
