 <UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Lord Morris of Manchester: My Lords, even at this early juncture will my noble friend accept, from those of us who worked day by day with the disability organisations, that a single Equality Commission without a single Equalities Act&#151;one that would recognise the reality that effective legislation to protect disabled people must differ in fundamental respects from other anti-discrimination legislation&#151;would be seen by disabled people as a step, not forward but backward? What special arrangements are being made to ensure that disabled people are fully and meaningfully consulted, bearing in mind their difficulties often in achieving even equal access to the consultative process?

 Baroness Scotland of Asthal: My Lords, all these are genuine points for anxiety and concern. I assure noble Lords that every effort is being made to ensure that all those who represent disability interests are consulted and brought in. The consultation process is ongoing and the Government are very anxious to hear all opinions on how to fashion any new step to make sure that it does not inure to the disadvantage of any group. Any change must be beneficial and advantageous to all."
