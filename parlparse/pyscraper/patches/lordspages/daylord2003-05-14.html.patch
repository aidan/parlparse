 <a name="30514-07_para16"></a>Before going into the detail of the Bill, it would be apposite for me to give noble Lords some background to the need for the Bill. First, there is the nature of Herefordshire. I think that it is the best county in England, but, as a Welshman, I would say that. It is an excellent rural county. It has excellent pasture land that fattens cattle and produces stores. It is varied in its cropping. It produces cider, hops and fruit in great abundance.
