 <a name="40108-13_para0"></a>The quinquennial review into the Duke of York's Royal Military School and Queen Victoria School has been discontinued before the production of a report in view of the constraints imposed by the Royal Warrants underpinning both foundations that effectively ruled out the review team's main recommendations, which involved removing the schools from government control. The review did, however, identify a number of issues for further study. These will be taken forward by the Adjutant General's headquarters in conjunction with the chief executives or head of each school. In the meantime, the two schools will remain as agencies of the Ministry of Defence.
