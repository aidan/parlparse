-<a name="41129-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville) </b>  My Lords, National Grid Transco&#039;s <i>Winter Outlook Report</i> was published by Ofgem on 20 October. It concluded that there is enough electricity-generating capacity to meet demand, even in a very severe winter. The forecast plant margin is now nearly 22 per cent, up from the 20.2 per cent mentioned in the <i>Winter Outlook Report</i>, and it could rise still higher if generators bring more mothballed plant back into service. As for gas, the report states that gas supplies can also be maintained using a combination of supplies from the UK continental shelf, gas imports, storage and demand management where necessary, even in a winter of the severity expected only once every 50 years.
