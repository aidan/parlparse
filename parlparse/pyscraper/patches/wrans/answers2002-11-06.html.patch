  In April 2000, the Government abolished the maximum amounts that could be given under Payroll Giving. To boost the scheme, the Government announced a three-year publicity campaign to promote the scheme to more employers and their employees and a 10 per cent. supplement on all Payroll Giving donations until April 2003. The cost of the supplement is met from public expenditure. The amount given under Payroll Giving has increased from #29 million in 1998&#150;99 to about #73 million in 2001&#150;02.
