 Casualty figures for children 0&#150;3 years are set out below. Information on the use of seat belts is not recorded in official casualty statistics, and therefore it is not possible to say whether these casualties were using child restraints or seat belts or not. The figures include casualties in buses or coaches where the passenger was injured whilst getting on or off&#151;these are not disaggregated from the casualty figures.

 Data on initial decisions are independent of applications data, and do not all necessarily relate to applications lodged in the same period.
 There are no data available on asylum appeals lodged by nationality. The requested information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records.
 In the first quarter (January to March) of 2002, an estimated 35 Iraqi principal asylum applicants were removed. This includes persons departing ''voluntarily'' after enforcement action had been initiated against them and persons leaving under Assisted Voluntary Return Programmes run by the International organisation for migration (IOM), and excludes dependants.

 Delivering the NHS Plan, published in April 2002, provides the latest forecasts for growth in the National Health Service workforce. By 2008, we expect the NHS to have net increases over the September 2001 staff census of at least 15,000 consultants and GPs. We anticipate that international recruitment will contribute towards this figure and our international recruitment assumption for consultants and GPs is 1,000 by 2005.
 
 We anticipate that by 2005, compared to 1999, up to 35,000 extra nurses may be working in the NHS, who have been trained overseas.
