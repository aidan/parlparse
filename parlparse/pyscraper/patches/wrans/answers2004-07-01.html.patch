-: The national service framework for older people (NSF) requires integrated falls services to be in place locally by April 2005. This should include appropriate links to osteoporosis. The Department will be monitoring formally the 2005 milestone at strategic health authority (SHA) level as this is included as one of the key targets in Improvement, Expansion and Reform, the priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;06. All SHAs currently report that the April 2005 target will be achieved in their area.

This will indicate if any further support or actions are necessary.
