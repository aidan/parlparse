  We have established good links between the two Departments on these issues. A joint working group of Home Office and Department of Health officials has been set up to oversee the strengthening and extension of the Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARCs) network in England and Wales. The development of SARCs has been discussed by the Interdepartmental Ministerial Group on Sexual Offending, which is chaired by the Home Office and includes a representative from the Department of Health. Officials are also working closely with Department of Health colleagues on plans to map and further develop non-statutory community-based services and to produce service guidelines in this area.

  Yes. Although we have used the working title of a National Rape Helpline, evidence from the scoping study suggests very strongly that the helpline will need to cater for a wider group of core service users, including adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse.
