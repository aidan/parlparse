 : First, I want to cover the accessibility and accuracy of information on the Government's off-balance sheet liabilities. Each year, particularly under this Government, and as we shall witness next week when we receive the documents, the Budget bundle has become larger and the Red Book has increased not only in cost but in size. Unfortunately, that does not necessarily mean that the information is more accessible or that all we need is included.

  As a strong supporter of our action in Iraq&#151;because, in my view, it has become clear that there is no other way to stop a fascist dictator who has biochemical weapons&#151;I believe that it is all the more important that we show that we are open to voluntary and co-operative progress on human rights by Governments with whom we have, by comparison, far less serious disagreements. The Cotonou application is supported by the relevant EU Commissioner and by most European Union countries, and I very much hope that we will not use our effective veto to block it. We believe in constructive engagement, and Cotonou is all about that. I hope that it will present the way forward for Cuba.
