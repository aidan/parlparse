Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) on obtaining this debate and on drawing attention to this important matter. As I listened to the debate and the contributions moving on from the specifics raised by my hon. Friend, it struck me that this is one of those debates where the title does not suggest the importance of the subject. There is evidence in this debate of consensus among Members that something needs to be done. I share that view, as I shall explain.
