During the Division, the Minister reminded me that I took a long time to find out which Department was responsible for the subject. After getting questions answered by the Department of Trade and Industry, I&nbsp;eventually tracked down the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. I am glad that he is here to respond to the debate.

That is dangerous. It is like gossip: a whisper becomes a shout, which becomes a megaphone-amplified voice. The ripple effect is, in my view, especially dangerous because of the number of unreliable polls that we get in some areas.
