 <p><a name="50112h03_spnew10a"><b>Mr. Andrew Mitchell (Sutton Coldfield)</b>  (Con):  I start by apologising to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and to the Minister for my late arrival.  I apologise, too, to the  hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) who, with great courtesy, gave me a copy of his speech.  The irony is that while he was delivering it, I was reading it, close to this Chamber.  I hope he feels that although he did not have my presence I was with him in spirit.</p>  
 <p>I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate.  Neighbourhood policing is a matter about which he has frequently expressed his concern.  The hon. Gentleman and I entered the House on the same day in 1987 when he was elected for a central constituency and I for a suburb of Nottingham.  I have the greatest possible affection for the city, which is a great place.</p>
