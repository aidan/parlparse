-) (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) on securing this timely debate. It is timely because of growing concerns, especially in severely disadvantaged areas, on which I want to concentrate this morning. It cannot be emphasised too often that our countryside exists because of our farmers. They have looked after it from generation to generation and from season to season.

 <a name="40316h01_para43">One of the reasons why so many millions of people visit my constituency in the Peak district is to enjoy the beautiful countryside that generation after generation of farmers has bequeathed to us. That can be neither emphasised nor repeated often enough. Too often we take the countryside for granted and imagine that it is beautiful because nature has made it so. However, the countryside is as it is because it has been maintained and farmed. One need only look at barren land that has not been looked after for a few seasons to realise that if the countryside and our national parks were not cared for, they would not be the attractive places that millions upon millions of people from different parts of the country visit every weekend. That is why I should like to concentrate on the Government's proposals for the SDAs.

 : Before I was interrupted, I was saying that my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting had his name at the head of an early-day motion that describes his very substantial concerns. I see the signatures of 53 other hon. Members who support him, and my hon. Friends the Members for Putney and for Battersea have supported him today in expressing concern about the decisions that Wandsworth council has taken about its council tax. Having grown up and gone to school in the area, as my hon. Friend the Member for Putney reminded us, I am sad that today's debate on Wandsworth should be about difficulties and negativity.

  (Con): On 24 May 2001, three months after the outbreak of foot and mouth, there entered into force the Animal By-Products (Amendment) (England) Order 2001. At the stroke of a bureaucrat's pen in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, there perished in this country a practice that has taken place for thousands of years, ever since mankind domesticated animals&#151;the feeding of food waste to pigs in the form of swill feed.
