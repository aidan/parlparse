  The Government-funded education mentoring programme in Warwick is helping young people to realise their potential and strengthening voluntary groups and neighbourhoods. The project will receive &#163;55,999 per annum for the years 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. Last year, 200 students volunteered in over 40 schools. It is an important scheme that shows that we can develop this in many ways. I am grateful for the support that my hon. Friend has given it.

  I completely agree. When I appeared before the Science and Technology Committee a year or so ago, we spoke about this issue, and I explained that work force reform and the inclusion of a range of adults with expertise from the community could play a major role in schools. I certainly envisage a continuing increase in school support staff, including those vital laboratory technicians to whom my hon. Friend referred.

Once parents start to understand that by deferring entry to 2006 they will have an enormous tax cut, attitudes to gap years will change.

As he also knows from the correspondence in which he and I have been engaged, we are working closely with that authority to find a solution. It may be worth pointing out to the House that there are two authorities out of the 150 local education authorities that are having some difficulty in implementing their statutory requirements. One is Croydon; the other is Tory-controlled Richmond.

  We are always happy to give guidance to small business, and we keep in close contact with the chambers of commerce as well as the Federation of Small Businesses. For the most part, they ask for more police resources to investigate fraud and closer working with prosecutors, but if there is a particular issue with small businesses having difficulty with the important new money-laundering regulations, we will do everything we can to help.
