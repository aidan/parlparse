 <a name="31201-03_para3">In the debate on the Gracious Speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer) expressed concern about community involvement in the planning process. Our proposals will open up the planning system by introducing local development frameworks, local development orders and statements of community involvement. That will strengthen the opportunity for local people to make their views known and to have a say in the future of the area in which they live. The new statement of development principles will govern the development of planning agreements such as those to which my hon. Friend referred in her speech.

  (Con): How does the Deputy Prime Minister reconcile those remarks with what he is planning to do with regional planning frameworks, which will effectively bypass, or get rid of, county councils?

  We have made it clear that regional planning frameworks should not be in the hands of the counties. We now have regional planning and spatial development. The county council will still be entitled to have a discussion about that, but in the main planning will be done at a regional level. That is what we have always said, and we will continue to do so. The regional spatial frameworks and the local frameworks will fit together to achieve sustainable community development.

 : Does not the Deputy Prime Minister feel a little uncomfortable taking power away from elected bodies and giving it to unelected regional planning boards?
