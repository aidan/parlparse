  The picture is indeed shifting, but it is important for the House to be clear about it. In the other place, Lord Bassam said that the decent homes programme would reduce carbon emissions by at least 2 megatonnes. The Government&#039;s energy efficiency plan for action, however, claims that the decent homes programme will be responsible for 0.05 megatonnes. The position has shifted, but has it really shifted that much?

  But we are already almost at that 20 per cent. point&#151;achieved by mechanisms that may not have been anticipated even two years ago. When we are moving towards the target, with which my hon. Friend is properly concerned, it seems unnecessary to add this provision to the Bill and set a numerical target, which may be overshot or outdated but none the less adds a degree of inflexibility. Indeed, it might even encourage a degree of complacency. Let us have neither suspicion of the Government&#039;s intentions nor encouragement to complacency. Let us not make an unnecessary amendment to the Bill.

  As I say, this should be a no-brainer. I ask the Minister to rethink his position and accept the Lords amendment. I do not understand why he wants to turn the win-win situation that my hon. Friend described into a no win situation in which we would be accused of reneging on commitments. The story that we have to tell is good, and we have made excellent achievements, so we need to seize the opportunity of achieving a long-held Labour aspiration. We should not give our political opponents a stick with which to beat us, or erect unnecessary barriers that would hinder next year&#039;s G8 negotiations.

 : I am sure that, like us, the Minister is strongly in favour of abolishing fuel poverty and meeting achievable targets on insulation with a hard-working programme. I do not believe that that is at issue. However, I would like to know why he believes that it is inappropriate and wrong to include the 20 per cent. target in primary legislation. Does he fear, for instance, that the Government could be taken to court gratuitously if the Lords amendment is accepted? Would a lot of legal time be taken up defending slow-burning Government programmes? Why does he agree with everything that has been said in favour of the target, but object to its inclusion in primary legislation?

  It is perfectly clear that the work that has to be carried out for the energy report and inspection is very much akin to that which needs to be carried out for a home condition report. It is, effectively, a medium-level survey. Quite frankly, it is a sight better than the drive-by survey that is so often done by those who carry out surveys and valuations. I accept, of course, that more detailed work is required in some circumstances, but I make the point that we already have a compulsory system of energy assessment, which will require little by way of add-on&#151;in terms of what needs to be looked at or time&#151;to produce a home condition report.

  The Minister has spoken in some detail about what would be in such an energy audit, but will he go to the key point? The directive requires that to be done by the time the property is sold, not at the point of marketing. That is the difference between the parties, I believe. We have no objection to energy audit being compulsory and having to be done before sale&#151;that is what the directive requires&#151;but producing a system under which all has to be done before the house is marketed is the genuine big problem here. It will cause so many difficulties in the housing market.

  That is a good point. As was mentioned in Committee, in other countries there are strict regulations&#151;indeed, laws&#151;preventing such a possible conflict of interests. In this country, that does not apply, and the Minister has given no guarantee that it is likely to. I think that there may well be real issues of probity. Such issues were raised in the other place, and they were raised by Conservative and Liberal Democrat spokesmen in Committee. Once again, however, we hear nothing from the Minister, despite the length of his speech.

  Much of what the Minister is saying is welcome, but I am concerned about what happens when someone chooses to market their property without going through an estate agent, as they have the right to do. When they produce their pack, how will they check who has access to such information? Will a prospective buyer gain access to the register? If so, will they access such information only in respect of the property in question, or will they be able to peruse information on all properties online, simply because they have said that they are interested in buying a particular property? I am slightly confused as to how the process will work.

Not only has he anticipated exactly the point that I was about to make on disclosure, but he has also made a typically shrewd point about a typographical error in the amendment.

  I shall take the issues raised in reverse order. The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) asked about insurance against error in the reports. I may say that an indemnity scheme has always been part and parcel of the proposition. The indemnity scheme will apply to home inspectors as it already does to conveyancers, and we think that it is a good idea to extend it to estate agents, through the estate agents redress scheme, which has been approved by the other place and has received a general welcome for both particular and general reasons. The monitoring of home condition reports will also allow judgments to be made about the performance of individual inspectors.
