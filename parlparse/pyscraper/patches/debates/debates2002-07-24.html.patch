  As I was saying, the best staff, those most capable of finding employment abroad, were often the ones who signed on for the packages. The programmes&#151;and I stress this to the Minister, because her colleagues will be interested&#151;were also very expensive for the Treasury. New blood had to be paid for, and it was not cheap. If the Government proceed with legislation that abolishes mandatory retirement ages in universities, I foresee a requirement for further and repeated new-blood schemes.
