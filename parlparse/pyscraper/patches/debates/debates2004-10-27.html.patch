  That is possible. National health service continuing care applies not only to people with dementia, but to people with all conditions. Some conditions are curable and it is therefore necessary to remove the continuing care package when someone is cured. That is not the case for people with dementia. However, their care package will need to be changed and, in the very unlikely event that they are cured, it is theoretically possible that they would revert to means-tested support. That would happen only if their predominant needs were no longer health needs and they no longer fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The primary reason for reassessment is to ensure that the care package always matches people&#039;s needs.

  I am glad to hear that, but I would be even more glad to hear the hon. Gentleman say that he still had an open mind about the outcome and that he was prepared to accept that it might be in the best interests of his constituents if Rebecca house did not continue to offer the services that it offers at the moment. He will also have to consider the idea that, if there are to be fewer of these units, the 28-bed unit to which he referred will almost certainly have to be very close to acute services, because of the intense health care that many of the people in these facilities require. The primary consideration in determining the location of that unit will have to be the safety and the health care of those patients, and it might not be appropriate for that type of unit to be in his constituency. It might be much better for his constituents&#151;although it would no doubt be more inconvenient for carers&#151;for it to be in Norwich. That is one of the issues that the local population will have to grapple with and talk about in the consultation. The hon. Gentleman will clearly have views about whether the right decision has been made, but we all need to keep an open mind about this.
