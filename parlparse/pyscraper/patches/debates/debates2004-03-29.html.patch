Consequently, I am pleased to inform the House that in recognition of the unique circumstances that set Ireland apart from other countries, the Ministry of Defence and the national lottery's New Opportunities Fund have put in place special arrangements with the Royal British Legion to allow Irish veterans who volunteered for service in the British armed forces and are now resident in the Republic of Ireland to be included in &ldquo;Heroes Return&rdquo;.

We have a considerable amount of infrastructure in Germany, as does the US, and we have very good relationships with our German allies. My hon. Friend asks when the last troops will leave Germany, but I do not think that I can give her an answer. We have met the commitment laid down in the strategic defence review to withdraw certain posts&#151;that is, a reduction of 2,100 posts by 2005. That target has been met, with the exception of the return of two Royal Tank regiments, involving 600 personnel, who are due to return in the third quarter of 2005, when they will be based in Tidworth. The delay in their transfer is due to the fact that the required living accommodation is not yet ready.

  My right hon. Friend is right. He brings a huge amount of experience to the discussion, having done an excellent job not only when he served in the Minister's place some years ago but in more senior positions. The key is consultation working things out with the various organisations. It is obvious that lawyers for various trade unions have been pushing the matter, so will the Minister tell the House why he did not properly consult the Institute of Directors, the Engineering Employers Federation, the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI?

 <a name="40329-25_para2">Hon. Members will note that new clause 6 does not contain remedies for cases where a complaint of unfair practices is upheld by the CAC. Paragraph 27C contains instead a power for the Secretary of State to provide for sanctions and remedies by order. The Government's intention was to set out those sanctions in full in these new clauses and amendments. However, this is a complicated area. The sanctions will, among other things, allow the CAC to re-run a ballot where appropriate, and we want to consider further a number of complexities associated with that. It is my intention that, following more detailed consultation with stakeholders, the Government will propose amendments in the other place to put these sanctions in the Bill.
