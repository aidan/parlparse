 Indeed, the directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers more than a year ago. I shall not begin a lengthy debate about how the Council of Ministers could agree something three or four months before being given the final text. I have some limited experience of working with bodies such as the Council of Ministers, and such behaviour is unfortunately somewhat familiar. Nevertheless, the Government have had many months to consult on the final text&#151;or the negotiating position that was agreed at the Council of Ministers.
