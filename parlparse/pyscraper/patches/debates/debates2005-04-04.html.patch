  In 1997 2.54&nbsp;million people of working age were receiving incapacity benefit. At the end of 2004&nbsp;there were 2.64&nbsp;million. The substantial growth of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that number during the 1980s and 1990s has been brought under control with the inflow reduced by one third. The latest statistics show a small but significant fall of 22,000&nbsp;in the total number of people on incapacity benefit over the past year.
