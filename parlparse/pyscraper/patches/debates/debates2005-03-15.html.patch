  Bearing in mind the recent comments in the other place to the effect that it should have primacy over this House on some issues because we are temporary politicians who happen to have been elected, is it not high time that we completed the reform of the House of Lords along the lines of the report produced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) and others? We need a high proportion of elected Members in a smaller second Chamber so that we can preserve and improve its deliberative, reviewing and scrutiny roles. In particular, we need to resolve the way in which we tackle legislative disputes between the two Houses in order to avoid the ping-pong paralysis that we saw last week.

  I certainly agree, to the extent that some in the other place made ridiculous comments about how we were just temporary Members of Parliament, whereas they were the more permanent guardians of our constitution. We in this House are accountable to our constituents, and that is why the Commons must always be supreme. Of course there are ways in which we could improve the legitimacy of the second Chamber; and we must return to that issue.</p>
