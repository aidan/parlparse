  (Lab): The Secretary of State knows that this is an immense problem. As more money goes in to HIV/AIDS and reproductive health, it simply will not be possible to improve health services unless we improve the supply of nurses and doctors. There is no sign of any international effort to tackle that issue. Staff are emigrating; staff are themselves dying from HIV/AIDS and there is a totally unsatisfactory secondary and tertiary health system. Perhaps there should be a World Health Organisation-led effort to deal with the problem of the capacity of health services through human resources in Africa.

  Perhaps I can answer this question in a little detail, if I might. First, we owe the heroes of the Arctic convoys an immense debt of gratitude. They risked, and in many cases gave, their lives under some of the harshest conditions imaginable in order to keep this nation free and democratic in the second world war.

 <a name="stpa_81">The Government recognise that extending the &quot;missing persons&quot; order under clause 7(1) and schedule 5(9) to &quot;non-responders&quot; may result in an increase in the number of applications to waive consent to use tissue in these situations. It is clear, however, that the numbers will still be small. There are 18 genetics centres in England, for example, and we might anticipate that each might have a couple of cases a year. We consider that it should remain an exceptional circumstance, but to save any potential burden on, and cost to, the NHS and to make it easier for both professionals and patients, we consider it appropriate for such applications to be made to the Human Tissue Authority rather than to the High Court.

  I want to bring to the attention of the House a number of points that have surfaced recently from the cancer research world, on which I seek clarification from the Minister. The concerns relate to material that has been stored previously, such as material stored several years ago. As someone whose material was stored several years ago, I can speak with some authority on the matter. I understand that ethics committees are already refusing permission because of the lack of consent in cases such as that of my own stored material. A number of people in my position would be horrified to think that material that had been lying in a tissue bank for some years could not be used now because of misunderstandings about the intentions of the Bill.

Those of us who served on the Standing Committee were only too well aware that the two authorities were designed to function in a similar manner, and we raised that issue in February. Happily, our advice was that if that was the Government&#039;s intention, they should at least tell the other place before the Bill completed its passage. That was overtaken in September by further announcements on the review.
