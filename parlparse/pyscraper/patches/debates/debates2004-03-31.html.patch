  The hon. Gentleman's proposal would remove &#163;800 million that the universities currently get from fees. He cannot argue that they will have to wait a few years for an extra &#163;1 billion while proposing that they should immediately lose almost &#163;1 billion in revenue, which they receive at the moment.

  The Minister has been characteristically honest, but that is not what I am proposing at all. The Liberal Democrat position is clear: we want to raise the higher rate of tax to 50p in the pound. That would apply to incomes of more than &#163;100,000 a year.

  I shall speak to new clauses 6 and 7 and the consequential amendments Nos. 32 to 52. I shall also speak to amendments Nos. 129 and 130. I understand that the Government are prepared to accept amendment No.129, and I am happy to allow the Minister to speak to it. I am pleased and grateful that the Government have made such an important concession.
