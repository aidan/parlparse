  (Lab): Although I welcome the massive drop in unemployment, especially among the youth in my constituency and neighbouring constituencies, my hon. Friend will no doubt be aware of the campaign that I am leading to attract civil service jobs from London. What is she doing to attract jobs to Ayrshire, where for many years the significant unemployment level has been down to the fact that we do not have our fair share of public sector jobs in the Ayrshire conurbation?

  That is absolutely typical of my good neighbour. She steals my next line, which I hoped was going to be my best one. I am making the case for being very careful about getting rid of the one agent for systemic change. I am worried about that in terms of what I have said about Ofsted and inspection and what I have said about the diminished role of education authorities.

At one level, it is slightly humorous in a party political sense that I am reading words that are virtually the same as&#151;in truth, they could be identical to&#151;the words I used 15&nbsp;years ago to describe the introduction of the policy. At another level, however, we are speaking about real people treating real patients in the health service and about 15&nbsp;wasted years. The point that my hon. Friend makes is a serious one.

  I was coming on to that point, and it is where the rights and responsibilities argument is the crux of the matter. We must take responsibility on behalf of the community to care for such unborn children, so the most obvious thing to do is to educate mothers about the effects of their behaviour so that they can choose not to behave in such a way. It is more difficult to treat babies who are sickly due to their mothers&#039; alcohol or drug abuse, under-nourishment, or any other behaviour than to encourage mothers not to behave in such a way.

  Is not the hon. Gentleman&#039;s argument just a symptom of the fact that we have an under-resourced health service? If it had been fully resourced by his party when it was in office, the private sector would have dwindled away because nobody would have needed to pay for private treatment. They could have had their operations done publicly, free of charge. That is the position in France, where there are twice as many doctors and twice as many beds.
