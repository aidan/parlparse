<p>
I agree that the facts should be known. Quite how decisions are
reached is a more difficult process to explain, but I believe that the
structure of decision-making needs to be re-examined.
</p>
<p>
I think the House should continue to do everything possible to improve
online publication on Bills.
</p>
<p>
The House takes seriously the potential of the Internet and already
has two senior officers with responsibility to improve and exploit
this medium for the benefit of the public. I would take an active
interest in maintaining progress in this direction.

	<p>Although I have not declared myself to be a candidate I am like all MPs
	immensely interested in the outcome of the election for Speaker.
  </p>
  <p>
	I am happy to endorse the three principles you set out on behalf of
	TheyWorkForYou.com.
  </p>
  <p>
	Transparency in financial matters, easy access to proposed legislation,
	and effective use of new technologies are all necessary features of a
	modern Parliament which embraces change.

		<p>The answers to your questions are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Yes</li>
 			<li>We should go much further than this and get MPs to help
suggest what future bills might be.  The public should then have a say
in what should be the topical debate on Thursday.</li>
 			<li>The internet is a handmaiden which politicians should warmly
grasp as a means of helping develop our ideas of effective democracy.</li>

		<p>Thank you for your email. I am sorry not to have been able to reply before now.

		<p>
I am happy to endorse the 3 principles that you list. The transparency
of Parliament, and its accessibility, need to be greatly improved and,
if elected, I would seek to ensure that they are.

		<p>We understand that you believe Tony Wright MP will be a candidate for
Speaker.

		<p>
Dr Wright is standing down at the next election, and he will not be
running for the position of Speaker.

We have not been contacted by theyworkforyou, but Dr Wright nonetheless
endorses your three principles.

		I would comment as follows on your three questions.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I agree with this.  I do think it is hight time that with
			modern electronic communications the people should be told in as much
			detail as possible how their money  is spent.
		  </li>
			<li>I think it very important that there should be fewer bills,
			more carefully thought-out.  It would be a very good idea to have both
			the details of the bill and the way in which bills in general proceed
			through the House of Commons to be made more clear.
			</li>
			<li>The Internet is here to stay and can be used to great effect.  I
			have noted your thoughts and think they are worthy of serious
			consideration although we do already have a Department here at the
			House of Commons who oversees all our electronic communications and
			reports directly to the House of Commons Commission.
			</li>
