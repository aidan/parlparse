		3 sits uneasily with how the House is currently run (through a

	<p>Although I have not declared myself to be a candidate I am like all MPs
	immensely interested in the outcome of the election for Speaker.
  </p>
  <p>
	I am happy to endorse the three principles you set out on behalf of
	TheyWorkForYou.com.
  </p>
  <p>
	Transparency in financial matters, easy access to proposed legislation,
	and effective use of new technologies are all necessary features of a
	modern Parliament which embraces change.

		<p>The answers to your questions are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Yes</li>
 			<li>We should go much further than this and get MPs to help
suggest what future bills might be.  The public should then have a say
in what should be the topical debate on Thursday.</li>
 			<li>The internet is a handmaiden which politicians should warmly
grasp as a means of helping develop our ideas of effective democracy.</li>

		<p>We understand that you believe Tony Wright MP will be a candidate for
Speaker.
		</p>
		<p>
Dr Wright is standing down at the next election, and he will not be
running for the position of Speaker.
		</p>
		<p>
We have not been contacted by theyworkforyou, but Dr Wright nonetheless
endorses your three principles.
