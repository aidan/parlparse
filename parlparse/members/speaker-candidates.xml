		<p>"My expenses since 06/07 are on my website, and my current expenses are
		updated weekly. I am in favour of transparency and have no objection to
		receipts being published. Happy to go along with 2, though I confess I
		don't know what the problem is with the current means of publication.
		3 sits uneasily with how the House is currently run (through a
		Commission) but happy to look at this and see how we can harness the
		internet to make the House more accessible, user-friendly and
		transparent."
