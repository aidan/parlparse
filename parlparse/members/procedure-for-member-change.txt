TODO:
get edm links updated
speech counts should be done by person id

This file describes all the mpinfo, and how it gets updated when the list of
members in all-members.xml alters.  There are scripts in this folder (e.g.
guardianconv.py) which makes XML files in this folder (e.g.
guardian-links.xml).

* = needs manually regenerating when all-members.xml changes
+ = gets rerun anyway by weekly scripts on baked

* personsets.py

+ register of members interests - current data for each current MP
currently linked to date regmem was published, so we have multiple entries
should for each person find their most recent regmem? or history?

* edm links - 
currently linked to date edmconv was last ran
will degrade with time, want to find latest valid for person

* BBC links - are indexed by member id
ephemeral (may persist, but be out of date and not linked to)
valid from last time bbcconv was run
ACTION: run bbcconv whenever MP lists change

+ public whip rebel/attend - are indexed by member id
rankings are for today
ratings are for limited time range of officership

guardian links - are indexed by person id
* majority / swing (guardianconv.py) - are for every MP id across range

photos - are of people, clearly ;)  so indexed by person id
need to manually find a new one and stick it in fawkes CVS

+ faxyourmpconv - data is available for current MPs for last 12 months
currently uses today as date, so will update with MP changes
ACTION: none, should be hooked by MP identifier?
