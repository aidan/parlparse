# Reading from official websites that aren't in structured data format, that change regularly	
# is just not worth it any more. Cabinet changes infrequently enough that it should be done
# manually and can then be up to date (complaints already arriving that we don't yet have
# David Cameron as PM, and it's impossible to override ministers.xml from the TheyWorkForYou
# end). So this simple file is to be manually updated (or web interface written), and will
# then become ministers-2010.xml with a script.
